This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAmsparity 20 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach 0.4 ml single dose pre-filled syringe contains 20 mg of adalimumab. \n \nAdalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nSolution for injection (injection).  \n \nClear, colourless to very light brown solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nAmsparity in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Amsparity can be given as \nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \npatients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age \nand older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \ntherapy and phototherapies. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAmsparity treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Amsparity is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised \nto consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Amsparity (see section 4.4). \nPatients treated with Amsparity should be given the patient reminder card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Amsparity if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nDuring treatment with Amsparity, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from \n2 years of age is based on body weight (Table 1). Amsparity is administered every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 1. Amsparity dose for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 2). Amsparity is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nTable 2. Amsparity dose for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nThe recommended Amsparity dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 3). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 3. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding w ithin \nthis time period. \n \nIf retreatment with Amsparity is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should \nbe followed. \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 4). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 4. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease \n \nPatient \nweight \n\nInduction dose Maintenance dose \nstarting at Week 4 \n\n< 40 kg • 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n• 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 \n\n20 mg every other \nweek \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPatient \nweight \n\nInduction dose Maintenance dose \nstarting at Week 4 \n\n≥ 40 kg • 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n• 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 \n\n40 mg every other \nweek \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n• < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n• ≥ 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by Week 12.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this indication. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 5). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with adalimumab without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n \nTable 5. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with uveitis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate \n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate \n \nWhen Amsparity therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for \npatients ≥ 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical \ndata are available on the use of an Amsparity loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nAmsparity is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the \npackage leaflet. \n \nAmsparity is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis and opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Amsparity. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period. \n \nTreatment with Amsparity should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic \nor localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to \ntuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, \nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \nAmsparity should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Amsparity should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Amsparity should be \ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis and appropriate antimicrobial or \nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise \ncaution when considering the use of Amsparity in patients with a history of recurring infection or with \nunderlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab. \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \ntuberculosis. \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Amsparity, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient reminder card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Amsparity therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Amsparity and in accordance with local \nrecommendations. \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \nAmsparity in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \nafter therapy with Amsparity. \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking \nTNF-antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \noutcomes. \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Amsparity should be \npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \nfungal infections. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Amsparity. For \npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Amsparity should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Amsparity should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nNeurological events \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \nof Amsparity in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Amsparity should be considered if any of these disorders \ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \nuveitis prior to the initiation of Amsparity therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for \npre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nAmsparity should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \n\n\n\n9 \n\nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young \nadult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory \nbowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and \nadalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with Amsparity cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of \nnon-melanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Amsparity. Melanoma and Merkel cell \ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n(see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Amsparity. Discontinuation of Amsparity \ntherapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Amsparity should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Amsparity is contraindicated in moderate \nto severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Amsparity must be discontinued in patients \nwho develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Amsparity may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Amsparity \nand is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Amsparity should \nnot be given (see section 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \npatient who requires surgery while on Amsparity should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab. \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee vaccinations above. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nExcipient with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nThe combination of Amsparity and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \nThe combination of Amsparity and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was \n6/69 (8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with \nRA (unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women \nwith CD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). \nThe adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for \nthe secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and \nserious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation \nof data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size \nand non-randomised design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \n\n\n\n12 \n\nof live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \nConsequently, Amsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdalimumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Amsparity (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long \nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative \ncolitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved \n6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during \nthe controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \ntreated patients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and \nreports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency \nseen among the various indications has been included.

profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared \nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and \n0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control−treated patients. \n \nIn controlled and open-label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient-years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient-years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with \nCrohn’s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of \n80.0 patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No \nmalignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient-years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \n\n\n\n18 \n\nsuppurativa, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per \n1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated \npatients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, \nsquamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years \namong control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years \namong control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open-label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient-years. The observed rate of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \nactive control − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive \ntitres at Week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The \npatients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or \ncentral nervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \n≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. \nMost ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 2 to < 4 years. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with \na control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients. \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \n\n\n\n19 \n\ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of \n166.5 days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT \nelevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated \npatients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been \npost-marketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver \nfailure, such as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nAmsparity is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n20 \n\nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1,  \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in \nadalimumab-treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel-group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or \nnon-MTX-treated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been \nwithdrawn from MTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on \nstable doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and or prednisone (≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day \nor 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of \n40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, \nmedian and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in Table 7. \n \nTable 7.

Disease flare criteria were \ndefined as a worsening of ≥ 30% from baseline in ≥ 3 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria, ≥ 2 active \njoints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease \nflare, patients were eligible to enrol into the open-label extension phase. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 8.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \nNSAIDs. \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR 30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the \nobserved data approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR 50/70/90 at Week 12 and Week 24 \nwere 90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded \n(Paediatric ACR 30) at Week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were \nmaintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this \ntime period. Overall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study \nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an \nopen-label (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary \nendpoint was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis \n(swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was \nachieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the \nadalimumab group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo \n\n\n\n22 \n\ngroup. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period \nthrough Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the \nstudy. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical \nimprovement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), \nswollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \nweek up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first \n104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \nadministered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and \nV had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by \nX-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nACR response \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \nTable 9. \n \nTable 9.

In RA study III, \nthese improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks. \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; \nand 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab \n40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; \n56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001). \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 \nresponses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination \ntherapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at \nWeek 104 (see Table 10). \n \nTable 10.

Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, \n170 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, \n154 patients (90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and \n102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and \nadalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently \ndiagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was \nsimilar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, \n171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were \nreported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab-treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space \nnarrowing score. Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 11). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage \nis maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients \nshowed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or \nless. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were \nevaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage \ndefined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \nTable 11.

The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, \n23.7% and 36.7%, respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability \nindex of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was \nseen at Week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component \nsummary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg \nevery other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional \nassessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was \nassessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of \n114 paediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a \nPhysician’s Global Assessment (PGA) ≥ 4 or > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement \nwith very thick lesions or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically \nrelevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical \ntherapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy. \n \nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \nmethotrexate 0.1-0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At Week 16, more patients randomised to \nadalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g. PASI 75) than those randomised to \n0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX. \n \nTable 13.

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were \nalso studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand \nand/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study \n(Psoriasis Study III). \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \n\n\n\n27 \n\nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained ≥ PASI 75 \nresponse at Week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were \nre-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional \n19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline PGA \nscore ranged from “moderate” (53% of subjects included) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus \nmethotrexate and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg \nand thereafter dose increases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of \n80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for \n16 weeks. There are no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. \nPatients receiving MTX who achieved a ≥ PASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive \nfurther dose increases. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the \nbaseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (< 1%) to “moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very \nsevere” (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an \nopen-label extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a \nPASI 75 response from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 14 and 15). \n \nTable 14.

Of the \npatients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the \nopen-label extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and \n24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. \nPASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, \nrespectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in \nwhich all patients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who \ndose-escalated, were considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates \nin these patients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label \ntherapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an \nopen-label extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time \nwith a median time to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None \nof these patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after \n16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1% [123/178] \nand 88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, \nimprovements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also \nsignificant compared to placebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \nachieved PASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands \nand/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 16). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA ≥ 10% (60% of patients) and BSA < 10% and ≥ 5% (40% of patients)). \n \nTable 16.

Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid \nand/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been \nintolerant to infliximab. \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: \n160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for \nsubjects < 40 kg. \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low \nDose or Standard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 17. \n\n \nTable 17.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in \nthe study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI. \n \nAdult Crohn’s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these medications. \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 \nand 80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at \nWeek 2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were \nrandomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at \nWeeks 0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these \npatients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, \n854 patients received open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. At Week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed \nseparately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after \nWeek 8. \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 20. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTable 20.

Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to \nother TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 21. \nClinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist \nexposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at Week 56. \n \nTable 21.

These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses \n(see section 4.2). \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed \nthrough at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, \ncontinued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and \n233 patients, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at Weeks 26 \nand 56 in CD Study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo \ngroup. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-masked, controlled study \nof 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious anterior \nuveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either \nplacebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in \ncombination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (see Figure 1, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nFigure 1. Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure in the paediatric uveitis \nstudy \n\n \nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \nAdult uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ‘time to treatment failure’. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see Table 22). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see Figure 2). \n \nTable 22.

Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure on or after Week 6 \n(study UV I) or Week 2 (study UV II) \n\n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nNote: P# = Placebo (Number of Events/Number at Risk); A# = Adalimumab (Number of Events/Number at \nRisk). \n \nIn Study UV I statistically significant differences in favour of adalimumab versus placebo were \nobserved for each component of treatment failure. In Study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, \n60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to \ndiabetic retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary \nanalysis of efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of \nopen-label adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in \nquiescence (no active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a \nconcomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2 %) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA \nwas either improved or maintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data \nbeyond Week 78 were generally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects \ndeclined after this time. Overall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued \ndue to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in Study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in Study UV I and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of \nanti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and \nthe occurrence of adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was \n5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml \n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and \n7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab \nwithout concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV). \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \nAt Week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 µg/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 µg/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at Week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 µg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 µg/ml for \nthe Low Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/ml \n(40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 ± 3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was 3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml). \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nAdults \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml \n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 µg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n40 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n5.5 µg/ml during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n12 µg/ml during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/ml were \nobserved in Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every \nother week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 µg/ml. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower \nin patients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment \nof fertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate \nmodels for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of \nneutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nAmsparity in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Amsparity can be given as \nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \npatients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age \nand older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \ntherapy and phototherapies. \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \n\n\n\n41 \n\nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies.  \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n(acne inversa) in adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional \nsystemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAmsparity treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Amsparity is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised \nto consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Amsparity (see section 4.4). \nPatients treated with Amsparity should be given the patient reminder card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Amsparity if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Amsparity, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from \n2 years of age is based on body weight (Table 1). Amsparity is administered every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 1. Amsparity dose for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n\n \nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs.  \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 2). Amsparity is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n \nTable 2. Amsparity dose for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs.  \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Amsparity dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 3). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 3. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nIf retreatment with Amsparity is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should \nbe followed. \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS.  \n \nThe posology of adalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling \nand simulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Amsparity dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nWeek 1 via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Amsparity 40 mg every other week, an increase in \ndosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Amsparity if necessary. It is recommended that \nthe patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment \nwith Amsparity. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Amsparity may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data \nin section 5.1). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 4). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 4. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease \n \n\nPatient \nweight \n\nInduction dose Maintenance dose \nstarting at week 4 \n\n< 40 kg • 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used:  \n• 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 \n\n20 mg every other \nweek \n\n≥ 40 kg • 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used:  \n• 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 \n\n40 mg every other \nweek \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n• < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n• ≥ 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by Week 12.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this indication.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 5). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with adalimumab without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nTable 5. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with uveitis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate \n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate \n \nWhen Amsparity therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for \npatients ≥ 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical \ndata are available on the use of an Amsparity loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAmsparity is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the \npackage leaflet.  \n \nAmsparity is available in other strengths and presentations.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n  \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Amsparity. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nTreatment with Amsparity should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic \nor localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to \ntuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, \nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \nAmsparity should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Amsparity should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Amsparity should be \ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or \nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise \ncaution when considering the use of Amsparity in patients with a history of recurring infection or with \nunderlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive medications.  \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab. \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis  \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \ntuberculosis. \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Amsparity, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient reminder card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Amsparity therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Amsparity, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \nAmsparity in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \nafter therapy with Amsparity.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking \nTNF-antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \noutcomes. \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Amsparity should be \npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \nfungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Amsparity. For \npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Amsparity should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Amsparity should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \nof Amsparity in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Amsparity should be considered if any of these disorders \ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \nuveitis prior to the initiation of Amsparity therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for \npre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nAmsparity should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young \nadult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory \nbowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and \nadalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with Amsparity cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).  \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of \nnon-melanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Amsparity. Melanoma and Merkel cell \ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n(see section 4.8).  \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking.  \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.  \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Amsparity. Discontinuation of Amsparity \ntherapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.  \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy.  \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.  \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Amsparity should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Amsparity is contraindicated in moderate \nto severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Amsparity must be discontinued in patients \nwho develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Amsparity may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Amsparity \nand is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Amsparity should \nnot be given (see section 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g. anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \n\n\n\n49 \n\npatient who requires surgery while on Amsparity should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction  \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures.  \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee vaccinations above.  \n \nExcipient with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Amsparity and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Amsparity and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was \n\n\n\n50 \n\n6/69 (8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with \nRA (unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152  (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women \nwith CD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). \nThe adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for \nthe secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and \nserious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation \nof data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size \nand non-randomised design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \nConsequently, Amsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nAdalimumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Amsparity (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long \nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative \ncolitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved \n6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during \nthe controlled period.  \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \ntreated patients.  \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab.  \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and \nreports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency \nseen among the various indications has been included.

for patients with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known \nsafety profile of adalimumab. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared \nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and \n0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled and open-label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient-years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient-years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with \nCrohn’s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of \n80.0 patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No \nmalignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient-years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per \n1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated \npatients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, \nsquamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years \namong control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years \namong control patients.  \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open-label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient-years. The observed rate of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years.  \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4).  \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \nactive control − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive \ntitres at Week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The \npatients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or \ncentral nervous system symptoms.  \n \nHepato-biliary events  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \n≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. \nMost ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 2 to < 4 years.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with \na control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis.  \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed \nby 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control \nperiod duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of \n166.5 days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT \nelevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated \npatients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been \npost-marketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver \nfailure, such as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine  \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nAmsparity is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.  \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in \nadalimumab-treated patients.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n59 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis).  \n \npJIA I  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel−group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or \nnon-MTX-treated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been \nwithdrawn from MTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on \nstable doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and or prednisone (≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day \nor 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of \n40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, \nmedian and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in Table 7.  \n \nTable 7.

Disease flare criteria were \ndefined as a worsening of ≥ 30% from baseline in ≥ 3 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria, ≥ 2 active \njoints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease \nflare, patients were eligible to enrol into the open-label extension phase.  \n \nTable 8.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer.  \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2).  \n \npJIA II  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \nNSAIDs.  \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR 30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the \nobserved data approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR 50/70/90 at Week 12 and Week 24 \nwere 90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded \n(Paediatric ACR 30) at Week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were \nmaintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this \ntime period. Overall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer.  \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study \nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an \nopen-label (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary \nendpoint was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis \n(swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was \nachieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the \nadalimumab group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo \ngroup. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period \nthrough Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the \nstudy. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical \nimprovement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), \nswollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 response.  \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis  \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed.  \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \nweek up to 10 years.  \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first \n104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \nadministered every other week up to 10 years.  \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and \nV had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by \nX-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  \n \nACR response  \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \nTable 9.  \n \nTable 9.

In RA study III, \nthese improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; \nand 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab \n40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; \n56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses.  \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).  \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and \n50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment.  \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination \ntherapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at \nWeek 104 (see Table 10).  \n \nTable 10.

Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, \n170 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, \n154 patients (90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and \n102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 responses.  \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and \nadalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently \ndiagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was \nsimilar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, \n171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were \nreported to be in remission at 10 years.  \n \nRadiographic response  \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab-treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space \nnarrowing score. Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 11).  \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage \nis maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients \nshowed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or \nless. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were \nevaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage \ndefined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less.  \n \nTable 11.

All doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability \nindex of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was \nseen at Week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) for all doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component \nsummary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg \nevery other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional \nassessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was \nassessed (RA studies I, III, IV).  \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time.  \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the \nSF-36 showed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy \nversus methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained \nthrough Week 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, \nimprovements in physical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of \n114 paediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a \nPhysician’s Global Assessment (PGA) ≥ 4 or > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement \nwith very thick lesions or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically \nrelevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical \ntherapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \nmethotrexate 0.1 – 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At Week 16, more patients randomised to \nadalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g. PASI 75) than those randomised to \n0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX.  \n \nTable 13.

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were \nalso studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand \nand/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study \n(Psoriasis Study III).  \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained ≥ PASI 75 \nresponse at Week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were \nre-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional \n19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline PGA \nscore ranged from “moderate” (53% of subjects included) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%).  \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus \nmethotrexate and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg \nand thereafter dose increases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of \n80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for \n\n\n\n66 \n\n16 weeks. There are no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. \nPatients receiving MTX who achieved a ≥ PASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive \nfurther dose increases. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the \nbaseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to “moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very \nsevere” (6%).  \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an \nopen-label extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks.  \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a \nPASI 75 response from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 14 and 15).  \n \nTable 14.

Of the \npatients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the \nopen-label extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and \n24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively.  \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. \nPASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, \nrespectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in \nwhich all patients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who \ndose-escalated, were considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates \nin these patients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label \ntherapy (total of 160 weeks).  \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an \nopen-label extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time \nwith a median time to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None \nof these patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \n\n\n\n67 \n\npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after \n16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1% [123/178] \nand 88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal.  \n \nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, \nimprovements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also \nsignificant compared to placebo.  \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \nachieved PASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively.  \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ for the \nhands and/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively \n[P = 0.014]).  \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 16). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA ≥ 10% (60% of patients) and BSA < 10% and ≥ 5% (40% of patients)).  \n \nTable 16.

Efficacy of adalimumab \nfor the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure \n\n\n\n68 \n\nlevels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on \ncross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more \nfrequent doses (see section 5.2).  \n \nAdult hidradenitis suppurativa  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies and an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis \nsuppurativa (HS) who were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a \n3-month trial of systemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules.  \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg \nevery week starting at Week 4 to Week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were \nre-randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, or placebo from Week 12 to Week 35). Patients who had been randomised to \nplacebo in Period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B.  \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 and \n40 mg every week starting at Week 4 to Week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral \nantibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab \nin Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every \nweek, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from Week 12 to Week 35). Patients who had \nbeen randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive placebo in Period B.  \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension \nstudy in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab \npopulation was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily.  \n \nClinical response  \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a \n11 point scale.  \n \nAt Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo \nachieved HiSCR. At Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced \na clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 17). Patients treated with adalimumab \nhad significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment.  \n \nTable 17.

Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in \nthe first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group \nexperienced worsening of abscesses (23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs \n13.9%, respectively).  \n \nGreater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in \nskin-specific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; \nStudies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the \nTreatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical \nhealth as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I).  \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at Week 12, the HiSCR rate at \nWeek 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing \nfrequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 18). \n \nTable 18.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in \nthe study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI.  \n \nAdult Crohn’s disease  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 \nand 80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at \nWeek 2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were \nrandomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at Weeks \n0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were \nnot further evaluated.  \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, \n854 patients received open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. At Week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed \nseparately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after \nWeek 8.  \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 22.  \n \nTable 22.

Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to \nother TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 23. \n\n\n\n72 \n\nClinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist \nexposure.  \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at Week 56.  \n \nTable 23.

These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses \n(see section 4.2).  \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed \nthrough at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, \ncontinued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and \n233 patients, respectively.  \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at \nWeeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the \nplacebo group.  \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-masked, controlled study \nof 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious anterior \nuveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either \nplacebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in \ncombination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nClinical response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (see Figure 1, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n \nFigure 1. Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure in the paediatric uveitis \nstudy \n\n \nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \nAdult uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was t́ime to treatment failure .́ Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see Table 24). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see Figure 2). \n \nTable 24.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, \n60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to \ndiabetic retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary \nanalysis of efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of \nopen-label adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in \nquiescence (no active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a \nconcomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2 %) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA \nwas either improved or maintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data \nbeyond Week 78 were generally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects \ndeclined after this time. Overall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued \ndue to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nQuality of life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in Study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in Study UV I and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of \nanti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and \nthe occurrence of adverse events.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nAbsorption and distribution  \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was \n5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml \n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and \n7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab \nwithout concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV).  \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since \nexposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and \ninadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week.  \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \nAt Week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n\n\n\n77 \n\n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 µg/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 µg/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at Week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 µg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 µg/ml for \nthe Low Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/ml \n(40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 ± 3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly).  \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was 3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml). \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nAdults  \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum.  \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml \n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week.  \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 μg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.  \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n80 mg on Week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/ml at \nWeek 2 and Week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at Week 12 through Week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 μg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n40 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n5.5 μg/ml during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n12 μg/ml during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 μg/ml were \nobserved in Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every \nother week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 μg/ml. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD). \n \nElimination  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower \nin patients with measurable AAA.  \n \nHepatic or renal impairment  \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment \nof fertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate \nmodels for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of \nneutralising antibodies in rodents.  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nAmsparity in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  \n \n• the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response \n\nto disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate.  \n• the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated \n\nwith methotrexate.  \n \nAmsparity can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.  \n \nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \nand to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.  \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n \nAmsparity in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Amsparity can be given as \nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \npatients aged less than 2 years.  \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age \nand older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS)  \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS  \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, \nwho have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs).  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Adalimumab \nhas been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in \npatients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and to improve \nphysical function.  \n \nPsoriasis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult \npatients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \ntherapy and phototherapies.  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n(acne inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to \nconventional systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nCrohn’s disease \n \nAmsparity is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients \nwho have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies.  \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and \n6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies.  \n \nUveitis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in \nadult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of \ncorticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate.  \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nAmsparity is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nAmsparity treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Amsparity is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised \nto consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Amsparity (see section 4.4). \nPatients treated with Amsparity should be given the patient reminder card.  \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Amsparity if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Amsparity, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised.  \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Amsparity.  \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with Amsparity. Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1.  \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Amsparity 40 mg every \nother week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every \nother week.  \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nDose interruption \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer \nresulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose \ninterruption.  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic \narthritis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period.  \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Amsparity 40 mg every other week may \nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and \nrisks of continued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered \nin a patient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate \nresponse is achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently \nbe reduced to 40 mg every other week.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa  \n \nThe recommended Amsparity dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is \n160 mg initially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \nfor two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg \ninjections in one day). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg \nevery other week (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during \ntreatment with Amsparity if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical \nantiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with Amsparity.  \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period.  \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Amsparity 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be \nre-introduced (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nCrohn’s disease  \n \nThe recommended Amsparity induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg at Week 2. In case there is a need for a \nmore rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one \nday or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two \n40 mg injections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher \nduring induction.  \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Amsparity and signs and symptoms of disease recur, \nAmsparity may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than \n8 weeks since the previous dose.  \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Amsparity 40 mg every other week may \nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Amsparity every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nSome patients who have not responded by Week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nThe recommended Amsparity induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe \nulcerative colitis is 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg \ninjections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in \none day). After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Amsparity 40 mg every other week may \nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Amsparity every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. \nAmsparity therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period.  \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nUveitis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, \nfollowed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited \nexperience in the initiation of treatment with Amsparity alone. Treatment with Amsparity can be \ninitiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory \nagents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting \ntwo weeks after initiating treatment with Amsparity.  \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1).  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required.  \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from \n2 years of age is based on body weight (Table 1). Amsparity is administered every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 1. Amsparity dose for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 2). Amsparity is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n \nTable 2. Amsparity dose for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nThe recommended Amsparity dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 3). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 3. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period.  \n \nIf retreatment with Amsparity is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should \nbe followed.  \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg)  \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of \nadalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation \n(see section 5.2).  \n \nThe recommended Amsparity dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nWeek 1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Amsparity 40 mg every other week, an increase in \ndosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered.  \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Amsparity if necessary. It is recommended that \nthe patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment \nwith Amsparity.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period.  \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Amsparity may be re-introduced as appropriate.  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data \nin section 5.1)  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 4). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 4. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease \n \n\nPatient \nweight \n\nInduction dose Maintenance dose \nstarting at Week 4 \n\n< 40 kg • 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used:  \n• 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 \n\n20 mg every other \nweek \n\n≥ 40 kg • 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used:  \n• 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 \n\n40 mg every other \nweek \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n• < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n• ≥ 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by Week 12.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this indication.  \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 5). Amsparity is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with adalimumab without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \nTable 5. Amsparity dose for paediatric patients with uveitis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate \n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate \n \nWhen Amsparity therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for \npatients ≥ 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical \ndata are available on the use of an Amsparity loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nAmsparity may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual \ntreatment needs. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children aged 4-17 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. There is no relevant use of Amsparity in children aged less than 4 years for this \nindication.  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nAmsparity is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the \npackage leaflet.  \n \nAmsparity is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\nInfections  \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Amsparity. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period.  \n \nTreatment with Amsparity should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic \nor localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to \ntuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, \nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \nAmsparity should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections).  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Amsparity should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Amsparity should be \ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or \nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise \ncaution when considering the use of Amsparity in patients with a history of recurring infection or with \nunderlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive medications.  \n \nSerious infections  \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis  \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \ntuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Amsparity, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient reminder card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Amsparity therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Amsparity, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations.  \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \nAmsparity in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed.  \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \nafter therapy with Amsparity.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections  \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking \nTNF-antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \noutcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Amsparity should be \npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \nfungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation  \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Amsparity. For \npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended.  \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Amsparity should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Amsparity should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \nof Amsparity in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Amsparity should be considered if any of these disorders \ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \nuveitis prior to the initiation of Amsparity therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for \npre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\nAllergic reactions  \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nAmsparity should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression  \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.  \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young \nadult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory \nbowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and \nadalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with Amsparity cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).  \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).  \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of \nnon-melanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Amsparity. Melanoma and Merkel cell \ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n(see section 4.8).  \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking.  \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.  \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Amsparity. Discontinuation of Amsparity \ntherapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.  \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy.  \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.  \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Amsparity should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Amsparity is contraindicated in moderate \nto severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Amsparity must be discontinued in patients \nwho develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.  \n \nAutoimmune processes  \n \nTreatment with Amsparity may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Amsparity \nand is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Amsparity should \nnot be given (see section 4.8).  \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g. anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \n\n\n\n93 \n\ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \npatient who requires surgery while on Amsparity should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures.  \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee vaccinations above.  \n \nExcipient with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Amsparity and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Amsparity and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was \n6/69 (8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with \nRA (unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women \nwith CD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). \nThe adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for \nthe secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and \nserious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation \nof data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size \nand non-randomised design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \nConsequently, Amsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nAdalimumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Amsparity (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long \nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \n\n\n\n95 \n\nenthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative \ncolitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved \n6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during \nthe controlled period.  \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \ntreated patients.  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer.  \n \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab.  \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and \nreports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency \nseen among the various indications has been included.

in sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8  \n**  including open-label extension studies \n1 including spontaneous reporting data  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa  \n \nThe safety profile for patients with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known \nsafety profile of adalimumab.  \n \n\n\n\n100 \n\nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared \nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.  \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.  \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and \n0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control−treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled and open-label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient-years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient-years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with \nCrohn’s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of \n80.0 patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No \nmalignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient-years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per \n1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated \npatients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, \nsquamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years \namong control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years \namong control patients.  \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open-label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient-years. The observed rate of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years.  \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4).  \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4).  \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \nactive control−treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive \ntitres at Week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The \npatients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or \ncentral nervous system symptoms.  \n \nHepato-biliary events  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \n≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. \nMost ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 2 to < 4 years.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with \na control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis.  \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed \nby 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control \n\n\n\n102 \n\nperiod duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of \n166.5 days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT \nelevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated \npatients.  \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been \npost-marketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver \nfailure, such as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04  \n \nAmsparity is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n103 \n\nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.  \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in \nadalimumab-treated patients.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed.  \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n≥ 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \nweek up to 10 years.  \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first \n104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \nadministered every other week up to 10 years.  \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \n\n\n\n104 \n\nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and \nV had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by \nX-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  \n \nACR response  \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \nTable 7.  \n \nTable 7.

In RA study III, \nthese improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; \nand 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab \n40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; \n56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses.  \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).  \n  \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and \n50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment.  \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination \ntherapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at \nWeek 104 (see Table 8).  \n \n\n\n\n105 \n\nTable 8.

Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, \n170 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, \n154 patients (90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and \n102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 responses.  \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and \nadalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently \ndiagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was \nsimilar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, \n171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were \nreported to be in remission at 10 years.  \n \nRadiographic response  \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab-treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space \nnarrowing score. Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 9).  \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage \nis maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients \nshowed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or \nless. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were \nevaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage \ndefined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less.  \n \n\n\n\n106 \n\nTable 9.

The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, \n23.7% and 36.7%, respectively.  \n \nQuality of life and physical function  \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability \nindex of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was \nseen at Week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component \n\n\n\n107 \n\nsummary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg \nevery other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional \nassessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was \nassessed (RA studies I, III, IV).  \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time.  \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF \n36 showed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment.  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis).  \n \npJIA I  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel − group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or \nnon-MTX-treated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been \nwithdrawn from MTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on \nstable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (≤ 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI \nphase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for \n16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received \nduring the OL LI phase is presented in Table 11.  \n \nTable 11.

Disease flare criteria were \ndefined as a worsening of ≥ 30% from baseline in ≥ 3 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria, ≥ 2 active \njoints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease \nflare, patients were eligible to enrol into the open-label extension phase.  \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nTable 12.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer.  \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2).  \n \npJIA II  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 -< 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \nNSAIDs.  \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR 30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the \nobserved data approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR 50/70/90 at Week 12 and \nWeek 24 were 90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who \nresponded (Paediatric ACR 30) at Week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR \n30 responses were maintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received \nadalimumab throughout this time period. Overall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer.  \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study \nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an \nopen-label (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary \nendpoint was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis \n(swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was \nachieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the \nadalimumab group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo \n\n\n\n109 \n\ngroup. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period \nthrough Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the \nstudy. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical \nimprovement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), \nswollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 response.  \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS)  \n \nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline \nscore of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in \nall groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) \npatients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti−rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) \npatients with glucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open−label period during which \npatients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional \n28 weeks.

Radiographs of hands, wrists, \nand feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on \nadalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified \nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS \nused for rheumatoid arthritis), was used.  \n \nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with \nplacebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 2.5 in the placebo \ngroup (at Week 24) compared with 0.0 ± 1.9; (p < 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at Week 48).  \n \nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to \nWeek 48 (n = 102), 84% continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of \ntreatment. Adalimumab treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical \nfunction as assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at Week 24. \nImproved physical function continued during the open-label extension up to Week 136.  \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis \n(≥ 10% BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 or ≥ 10) who were \ncandidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients \nenrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety \nand efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque \npsoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a \nrandomised double-blind study (Psoriasis Study III).  \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \n≥ PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were \nre-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional \n19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline \nPhysician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from “moderate” (53% of subjects included) to \n“severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus \nmethotrexate and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg \nand thereafter dose increases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of \n80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for \n16 weeks. There are no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. \nPatients receiving MTX who achieved a ≥ PASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive \nfurther dose increases. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the \nbaseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to “moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very \nsevere” (6%).  \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an \nopen-label extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks.  \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a \nPASI 75 response from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 17 and 18).  \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nTable 17.

Of the \npatients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the \nopen-label extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and \n24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively.  \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. \nPASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, \nrespectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in \nwhich all patients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who \ndose-escalated, were considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates \nin these patients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label \ntherapy (total of 160 weeks).  \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an \nopen-label extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time \nwith a median time to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None \nof these patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after \n16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1% [123/178] \nand 88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal.  \n \nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, \nimprovements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also \nsignificant compared to placebo.  \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \nachieved PASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively.  \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ for the \nhands and/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively \n[P = 0.014]).  \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 19). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA ≥ 10% (60% of patients) and BSA < 10% and ≥ 5% (40% of patients)).  \n \nTable 19.

The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules.  \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg \nevery week starting at Week 4 to Week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were \nre-randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, or placebo from Week 12 to Week 35). Patients who had been randomised to \nplacebo in Period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B.  \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 and \n40 mg every week starting at Week 4 to Week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral \nantibiotic therapy during the study.

Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in \nthe first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group \nexperienced worsening of abscesses (23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs \n13.9%, respectively).  \n \nGreater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in \nskin-specific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; \nStudies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the \nTreatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical \nhealth as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I).  \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at Week 12, the HiSCR rate at \nWeek 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing \nfrequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 22).  \n \nTable 22.

Longer term \ntreatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings.  \n \nAmong patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at Week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, \nthe HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar \nto that observed before withdrawal (56.0 %).  \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa  \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab \nfor the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure \nlevels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on \ncross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more \nfrequent doses (see section 5.2).  \n \nCrohn’s disease  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at \nWeek 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and \n20 mg at Week 2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab \nwere randomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at \nWeeks 0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these \npatients were not further evaluated.  \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, \n854 patients received open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. At Week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed \nseparately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after \nWeek 8.  \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 23.  \n \nTable 23.

Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to \nother TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 24. \nClinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist \nexposure.  \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at Week 56.  \n \nTable 24.

These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses \n(see section 4.2).  \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed \nthrough at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, \ncontinued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and \n233 patients, respectively.  \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at \nWeeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the \nplacebo group.  \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease  \n \nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body \nweight (< 40 kg or ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, \nwith moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index \n(PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid \nand/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been \nintolerant to infliximab.  \n \n\n\n\n120 \n\nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: \n160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for \nsubjects < 40 kg.  \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low \nDose or Standard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 25.  \n \nTable 25.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in \nthe study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with \nmoderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) \nin randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at Weeks \n0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 80 mg at Week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at \nWeek 0 followed by 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received \n40 mg eow. Clinical remission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at \nWeek 8.  \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg \neow thereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of \nremission at Week 8 and for maintenance of remission at Week 52.  \n \nPatients induced with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at Week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% vs. 9% respectively, p = 0.031) and \nstudy UC-II (17% vs. 9% respectively, p = 0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with \nadalimumab who were in remission at Week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at Week 52.  \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in Table 28.  \n \nTable 28.

Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in \nclinical remission per partial Mayo score.  \n \nHospitalisation rates  \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The \nnumber of all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. \n0.26 per patient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related \nhospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year.  \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score.  \n \nUveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15.  \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ‘time to treatment failure’. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical response  \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see Table 29). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see Figure 2).  \n \n\n\n\n123 \n\nTable 29.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab.  \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, \n60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to \ndiabetic retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary \nanalysis of efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of \nopen-label adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in \nquiescence (no active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a \nconcomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2 %) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA \nwas either improved or maintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data \nbeyond Week 78 were generally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects \ndeclined after this time. Overall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued \ndue to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in Study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in Study UV I and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in Study UV II. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-masked, controlled study \nof 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious anterior \nuveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either \nplacebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in \ncombination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \n\n\n\n125 \n\ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (see Figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n \nFigure 3. Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure in the paediatric uveitis \nstudy \n\n \nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n\n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of \nanti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and \nthe occurrence of adverse events.  \n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from \n11 to 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum.  \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml \n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was \n5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml \n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and \n7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab \nwithout concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult \nnonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state concentration at \nWeek 68 was 8.0 ± 4.6 µg/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 µg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV).  \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n80 mg on Week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/ml at \nWeek 2 and Week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at Week 12 through Week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 μg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n127 \n\nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since \nexposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and \ninadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week.  \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n40 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n5.5 µg/ml during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n12 µg/ml during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/ml were \nobserved in Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every \nother week.  \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \nAt Week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7±6.6 µg/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6±6.1 µg/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at Week 52 were 9.5±5.6 µg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5±2.2 µg/ml for the \nLow Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3±11.4 μg/ml \n(40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7±3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly).  \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by \n80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n12 µg/ml during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 µg/ml were \nobserved in ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every \nother week.  \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 µg/ml.  \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was 3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml). \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower \nin patients with measurable AAA.  \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment \nof fertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate \nmodels for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of \nneutralising antibodies in rodents.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n156 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nAmsparity 20 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nadalimumab \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information. \n− Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n− Your child’s doctor will also give you a patient reminder card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before your child is given Amsparity and during \ntreatment with Amsparity. Keep this patient reminder card with you or your child. \n\n− If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n− This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child. \n− If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Amsparity is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Amsparity \n3. How to use Amsparity \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Amsparity \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Amsparity is and what it is used for \n \nAmsparity contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your child’s body’s \nimmune (defence) system. \n \nAmsparity is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n• polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n• paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \n• paediatric plaque psoriasis \n• paediatric Crohn’s disease \n• paediatric uveitis \n \nThe active ingredient in Amsparity, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved \nin the immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed \n\n\n\n157 \n\nabove. By attaching to TNFα, Amsparity blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these \ndiseases. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first \nappears in childhood. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 \nto 17 years. Your child may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Amsparity to treat his/her \npolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where \ntendons join the bone. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \nYour child may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Amsparity to treat his/her \nenthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to \n17 years for whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked \nvery well or are not suitable. \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \n \nIf your child has Crohn’s disease, your child will first be given other medicines. If your child does not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, your child will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and \nsymptoms of his/her Crohn’s disease. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nmay lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines \nthat move across the field of vision). Amsparity works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat children and adolescents with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of \nage with inflammation affecting the front of the eye. \n \nYour child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child \nwill be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease. \n \n\n\n\n158 \n\n \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Amsparity  \n \nDo not use Amsparity \n \n• if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n• if your child has a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or \n\nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \nimportant that you tell your child’s doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, for example, \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n \n• if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your child’s doctor if \n\nyour child has had or has a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before using Amsparity.  \n \nIt is important that you and your child’s doctor record the brand name and batch number of your \nchild’s medication. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n• If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Amsparity and contact your child’s doctor immediately, \nsince in rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n\n \nInfections \n \n• If your child has an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the \n\nbody (for example, leg ulcer), consult your child’s doctor before starting Amsparity. If you are \nunsure, contact your child’s doctor. \n\n \n• Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Amsparity treatment. This \n\nrisk may increase if your child has problems with his/her lungs. These infections may be serious \nand include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other \nopportunistic infections (unusual infectious organisms), and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare \ncases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your child’s doctor if your \nchild gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your child’s doctor \nmay recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your child’s \n\ndoctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Amsparity. \nThis will include a thorough medical evaluation including your child’s medical history and \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these \ntests should be recorded on your child’s patient reminder card. \n \n\n• It is very important that you tell your child’s doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if \nhe/she has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If your child has active \ntuberculosis, do not use Amsparity. \n\n \n\n\n\n159 \n\n• Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child had treatment for the prevention of \ntuberculosis. \n\n \n• If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack of \n\nenergy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your child’s doctor \nimmediately. \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections \n\nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic (found). \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor if your child has had infections which keep coming back or other \n\nconditions that increase the risk of infections. \n \n• You and your child’s doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while your child is \n\nbeing treated with Amsparity. It is important to tell your child’s doctor if your child gets \nsymptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nHepatitis B \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has \n\nactive HBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of getting HBV. Your child’s doctor \nshould test your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry \nthe virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \nimmune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening.  \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n• If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your child’s doctor that he/she is \n\ntaking Amsparity. Your child’s doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n• If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \n\naround the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your child’s doctor will decide if he/she should \nreceive or continue to receive Amsparity. Tell your child’s doctor immediately if your child gets \nsymptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part \nof the body. \n\n \nVaccination \n \n• Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that \n\nmay cause infections and should not be given during treatment with Amsparity. Check with your \nchild’s doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, \nchildren be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with \nAmsparity. If your child received Amsparity while she was pregnant, her baby may be at higher \nrisk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last Amsparity dose she \nreceived during pregnancy. It is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care \nprofessionals about your child’s Amsparity use during her pregnancy so they can decide when \nher baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n• It is important to tell your child’s doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If \n\nyour child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Amsparity, his/her heart failure status \n\n\n\n160 \n\nmust be closely monitored by your child’s doctor. If he/she develops new or worsening \nsymptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of his/her feet), you must contact \nyour child’s doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help your child to stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, bruises \nor bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your child’s doctor right away. Your child’s doctor \nmay decide to stop treatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNFα blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affects blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Amsparity the \nrisk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, an \nuncommon and severe type of lymphoma has been seen in patients taking adalimumab. Some of \nthose patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your \nchild’s doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Amsparity. \n\n \n• In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \n\nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your child’s doctor. \n\n \n• There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNFα \nblocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your child’s \ndoctor whether treatment with a TNFα blocker is appropriate for your child. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n• On rare occasions, treatment with Amsparity could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\nchild’s doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness \noccur. \n\n \nOther medicines and Amsparity \n \nTell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nAmsparity can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYour child should not take Amsparity with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or \nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \nhave questions, please ask your child’s doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nYour child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \nuse for at least 5 months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \n\n\n\n161 \n\nIf your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n \nAmsparity should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n \nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive adalimumab. \n \nAmsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIf your child receives Amsparity during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell her baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about her \nAmsparity use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAmsparity may have a small effect on your child’s ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room \nspinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Amsparity. \n \nAmsparity contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Amsparity \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist has told you. Check with \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended doses for Amsparity in each of the approved uses are shown in the following table. \nYour child’s doctor may prescribe another strength of Amsparity if your child needs a different dose. \n \nAmsparity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nAge or body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nChildren and adolescents from \n2 years of age weighing 30 kg \nor more \n\n40 mg every other week Not applicable \n\nChildren and adolescents from \n2 years of age weighing 10 kg \nto less than 30 kg \n\n20 mg every other week Not applicable \n\n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \nAge or body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nChildren and adolescents from \n6 years of age weighing 30 kg \nor more \n\n40 mg every other week Not applicable \n\n\n\n162 \n\nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \nAge or body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nChildren and adolescents from \n6 years of age weighing 15 kg \nto less than 30 kg \n\n20 mg every other week Not applicable \n\n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nAge or body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nChildren and adolescents from 4 \nto 17 years of age weighing \n30 kg or more \n\nFirst dose of 40 mg, followed \nby 40 mg one week later. \n \nThereafter, the usual dose is \n40 mg every other week. \n\nNot applicable \n\nChildren and adolescents from 4 \nto 17 years of age weighing \n15 kg to less than 30 kg \n\nFirst dose of 20 mg, followed \nby 20 mg one week later. \n \nThereafter, the usual dose is \n20 mg every other week. \n\nNot applicable \n\n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \nAge or body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nChildren and adolescents from 6 \nto 17 years of age weighing \n40 kg or more \n\nFirst dose of 80 mg, followed \nby 40 mg two weeks later. \n \nIf a faster response is required, \nyour child’s doctor may \nprescribe a first dose of 160 mg, \nfollowed by 80 mg two weeks \nlater. \n \nThereafter, the usual dose is \n40 mg every other week. \n\nYour child’s doctor may \nincrease the dosage to 40 mg \nevery week or 80 mg every \nother week. \n\nChildren and adolescents from 6 \nto 17 years of age weighing less \nthan 40 kg \n\nFirst dose of 40 mg, followed \nby 20 mg two weeks later. \n \nIf a faster response is required, \nthe doctor may prescribe a first \ndose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg two weeks later. \n \nThereafter, the usual dose is \n20 mg every other week. \n\nYour child’s doctor may \nincrease the dose frequency to \n20 mg every week. \n\n \n\n\n\n163 \n\nPaediatric uveitis \nAge or body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nChildren and adolescents from \n2 years of age weighing less \nthan 30 kg \n\n20 mg every other week Your child’s doctor may \nprescribe an initial dose of \n40 mg to be administered one \nweek prior to the start of the \nusual dose of 20 mg every other \nweek. \nAmsparity is recommended for \nuse in combination with \nmethotrexate. \n\nChildren and adolescents from \n2 years of age weighing 30 kg \nor more \n\n40 mg every other week Your child’s doctor may \nprescribe an initial dose of \n80 mg to be administered one \nweek prior to the start of the \nusual dose of 40 mg every other \nweek. \nAmsparity is recommended for \nuse in combination with \nmethotrexate. \n\n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nAmsparity is administered by injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nDetailed instructions on how to inject Amsparity, the Instructions for Use, are provided at the \nend of this leaflet. \n \nIf you use more Amsparity than you should \n \nIf you accidentally inject your child with Amsparity more frequently than you should, call your child’s \ndoctor or pharmacist and explain that your child has taken more than required.

These instructions show step-by-step how to prepare and give an injection.  \nStore Amsparity pre-filled syringe in the refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C.  \nStore Amsparity pre-filled syringe in the original carton until use to protect from direct sunlight. \nIf needed, for example when you and your child are traveling, you may store Amsparity \npre-filled syringe at room temperature up to 30°C for up to 30 days. \nKeep Amsparity, injection supplies, and all other medicines out of the reach of children. \n \n \nAmsparity for injection comes in a disposable single use pre-filled syringe that contains a single dose \nof medicine. \nDo not try to inject Amsparity to your child until you have read and understood the Instructions for \nUse. If your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist decides that you may be able to give injections of \nAmsparity to your child at home, you should receive training on the correct way to prepare and inject \nAmsparity. \nIt is also important to talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist to be sure you understand your \nchild’s Amsparity dosing instructions. To help you remember when to inject Amsparity, you can mark \nyour calendar ahead of time. Talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have any questions \nabout the correct way to inject Amsparity. \nAfter proper training, the Amsparity injection can be given by your child or given by another person, \nfor example, a family member or friend. \n \n1. Supplies you need  \n\n \n• You will need the following supplies for each injection of Amsparity. Find a clean, flat surface \n\nto place the supplies on. \no 1 Amsparity pre-filled syringe in a tray, inside the carton \no 1 alcohol swab, inside the carton \no 1 cotton ball or gauze pad (not included in the Amsparity carton) \no A suitable sharps container (not included in the Amsparity carton). \nImportant: If you have any questions about your child’s Amsparity pre-filled syringe or \nmedicine, talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n172 \n\n2. Getting ready \n \n• Remove Amsparity carton from the refrigerator. \n• Open the carton and take out the tray containing the pre-filled syringe. \n• Check the carton and tray; do not use if: \n\no the expiration date has passed \no it has been frozen or thawed \no it has been dropped, even if it looks undamaged \no it has been out of the refrigerator for more than 30 days \no it appears to be damaged \no the seals on a new carton are broken. \n\n• If any of the above apply, dispose of the pre-filled syringe in the same way as a used syringe. \nYou will need a new pre-filled syringe to give your child’s injection. \n\n• Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry completely.  \nIf you have any questions about your child’s medicine, please talk to your child’s doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Peel back the paper seal on the tray. \n• Remove 1 pre-filled syringe from the tray and put the original carton with any unused pre-filled \n\nsyringes back in the refrigerator. \n• Do not use the syringe if it appears to be damaged. \n• The pre-filled syringe may be used straight from the refrigerator. \n• You may find that using the pre-filled syringe at room temperature reduces stinging or \n\ndiscomfort. Leave the pre-filled syringe at room temperature away from direct sunlight for 15 to \n30 minutes before your child’s injection. \n\n• Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject. \nAlways hold the pre-filled syringe by the barrel to prevent damage. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \n \n \n• Look carefully at your child’s medicine in the window.  \n• Gently tilt the pre-filled syringe back and forth to check the medicine. \n• Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. Shaking can damage your child’s medicine. \n• Make sure the medicine in the pre-filled syringe is clear and colourless to very light brown and \n\nfree from flakes or particles. It is normal to see one or more air bubbles in the window. Do not \nattempt to remove air bubbles. \nIf you have any questions about your child’s medicine, please talk to your child’s doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Choose a different site each time you give your child an injection. \n• Do not inject into bony areas or areas on your child’s skin that are bruised, red, sore (tender) or \n\nhard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. \no If your child has psoriasis, do not inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin \n\npatches or lesions on your child’s skin. \n• Do not inject through your child’s clothes. \n• Wipe the injection site with the alcohol swab. \n• Allow the injection site to dry. \n \n \n\n\n\n174 \n\n \n \n \n• Hold the pre-filled syringe by the syringe barrel. Carefully pull the needle cover straight off and \n\naway from your body when you are ready to inject. \n• It is normal to see a few drops of medicine at the needle tip when you remove the needle cover. \n• Throw the needle cover away into a sharps disposal container. \n\nNote: Be careful when you handle the pre-filled syringe to avoid an accidental needle stick \ninjury. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n• Gently pinch up a fold of skin in the cleaned injection site area. \n• Insert the needle to its full depth into the skin, at a 45 degree angle, as shown.  \n• After the needle is inserted, release the pinched skin. \n\nImportant: Do not re-insert the needle into your child’s skin. If the needle has already been \ninserted into the skin and you change your mind about where to inject, you will need a \nreplacement pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n \n \n\n• Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod all the way down until the barrel is \nempty. It usually takes 2 to 5 seconds to deliver the dose. \nNote: It is recommended to hold the pre-filled syringe in the skin for an additional 5 seconds \nafter the plunger has been pressed down completely. \n\n• Pull the needle out of the skin at the same angle at which it entered. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n• Check that your child’s medicine has completely emptied from the pre-filled syringe. \n• Never re-insert the needle. \n• Never re-cap the needle. \n\nNote: If the grey stopper is not in the position shown, you may not have injected all of your \nchild’s medicine. Talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist right away. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n176 \n\n \n \n \n• Dispose of the syringe straight away as instructed by your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist \n\nand in accordance with local health and safety laws. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Look closely at your child’s injection site. If there is blood, use a clean cotton ball or gauze pad \n\nto press lightly on the injection area for a few seconds.  \n• Do not rub the site. \n\nNote: Store any unused syringes in the refrigerator in the original carton. \n \n \nSee over for \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n\n\n177 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nAmsparity 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection \nadalimumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information.  \n− Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n− Your child’s doctor will also give you a patient reminder card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before your child is given Amsparity and during \ntreatment with Amsparity. Keep this patient reminder card with you or your child.  \n\n− If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n− This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child. \n− If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Amsparity is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Amsparity  \n3. How to use Amsparity  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Amsparity  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Amsparity is and what it is used for  \n \nAmsparity contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your child’s body’s \nimmune (defence) system.  \n \nAmsparity is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n• polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n• paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \n• paediatric plaque psoriasis  \n• adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa  \n• paediatric Crohn’s disease \n• paediatric uveitis  \n \nThe active ingredient in Amsparity, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved \nin the immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed \nabove. By attaching to TNFα, Amsparity blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these \ndiseases.  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first \nappears in childhood.  \n \n\n\n\n178 \n\nAmsparity is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 \nto 17 years. Your child may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Amsparity to treat his/her \npolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where \ntendons join the bone. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \nYour child may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Amsparity to treat his/her \nenthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for \nwhom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or \nare not suitable.  \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful \ninflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that \nmay leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the \narmpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents from 12 years of age. Amsparity can \nreduce the number of nodules and abscesses your child has, and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well \nenough, your child will be given Amsparity.  \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease  \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.  \n \nIf your child has Crohn’s disease, your child will first be given other medicines. If your child does not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, your child will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and \nsymptoms of his/her Crohn’s disease.  \n \nPaediatric uveitis  \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nmay lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines \nthat move across the field of vision). Amsparity works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat children and adolescents with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of \nage with inflammation affecting the front of the eye.  \n\n\n\n179 \n\n \nYour child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your \nchild will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Amsparity  \n \nDo not use Amsparity  \n \n• if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \n• if your child has a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or \n\nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \nimportant that you tell your child’s doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, for example, \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n\n \n• if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your child’s doctor if \n\nyour child has had or has a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before using Amsparity. \n \nIt is important that you and your child’s doctor record the brand name and batch number of your \nchild’s medication. \n  \nAllergic reactions \n \n• If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Amsparity and contact your child’s doctor immediately, \nsince in rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening.  \n\n \nInfections \n \n• If your child has an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the \n\nbody (for example, leg ulcer), consult your child’s doctor before starting Amsparity. If you are \nunsure, contact your child’s doctor.  \n\n \n• Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Amsparity treatment. This \n\nrisk may increase if your child has problems with his/her lungs. These infections may be serious \nand include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other \nopportunistic infections (unusual infectious organisms), and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare \ncases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your child’s doctor if your \nchild gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your child’s doctor \nmay recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity.  \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your child’s \n\ndoctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Amsparity. \nThis will include a thorough medical evaluation including your child’s medical history and \nscreening tests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these \ntests should be recorded on your child’s patient reminder card. \n\n  \n\n\n\n180 \n\n• It is very important that you tell your child’s doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if \nhe/she has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If your child has active \ntuberculosis, do not use Amsparity. \n\n \n• Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child had treatment for the prevention of \n\ntuberculosis.  \n \n\n• If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack of \nenergy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your child’s doctor \nimmediately.  \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections \n\nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic (found).  \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor if your child has had infections which keep coming back or other \n\nconditions that increase the risk of infections.  \n \n• You and your child’s doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while your child is \n\nbeing treated with Amsparity. It is important to tell your child’s doctor if your child gets \nsymptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.  \n\n \nHepatitis B \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has \n\nactive HBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of getting HBV. Your child’s doctor \nshould test your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry \nthe virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \nimmune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening.  \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n• If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your child’s doctor that he/she is \n\ntaking Amsparity. Your child’s doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity.  \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n• If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \n\naround the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your child’s doctor will decide if he/she should \nreceive or continue to receive Amsparity. Tell your child’s doctor immediately if your child gets \nsymptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part \nof the body.  \n\n \nVaccination \n \n• Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that \n\nmay cause infections and should not be given during treatment with Amsparity. Check with your \nchild’s doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, \nchildren be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with \nAmsparity. If your child received Amsparity while she was pregnant, her baby may be at higher \nrisk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last Amsparity dose she \nreceived during pregnancy. It is important that you tell her baby’s doctors and other health care \nprofessionals about your child’s Amsparity use during her pregnancy so they can decide when \nher baby should receive any vaccine.  \n\n \n\n\n\n181 \n\nHeart failure \n \n• It is important to tell your child’s doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If \n\nyour child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Amsparity, his/her heart failure status \nmust be closely monitored by your child’s doctor. If he/she develops new or worsening \nsymptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of his/her feet), you must contact \nyour child’s doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help your child to stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, bruises \nor bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your child’s doctor right away. Your child’s doctor \nmay decide to stop treatment.  \n\n \nCancer \n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNFα blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affects blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Amsparity the \nrisk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, an \nuncommon and severe type of lymphoma has been seen in patients taking adalimumab. Some of \nthose patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your \nchild’s doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Amsparity.  \n\n \n• In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \n\nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your child’s doctor.  \n\n \n• There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNFα \nblocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your child’s \ndoctor whether treatment with a TNFα blocker is appropriate for your child.  \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n• On rare occasions, treatment with Amsparity could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\nchild’s doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness \noccur. \n\n \nOther medicines and Amsparity  \n \nTell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \nother medicines.  \n \nAmsparity can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n \nYour child should not take Amsparity with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or \nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \nhave questions, please ask your child’s doctor.  \n \n\n\n\n182 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nYour child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \nuse for at least 5 months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \nIf your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n \nAmsparity should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n \nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive adalimumab. \n \nAmsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIf your child receives Amsparity during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell her baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about her \nAmsparity use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines, see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n \nDriving and using machines  \n \nAmsparity may have a small effect on your child’s ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room \nspinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Amsparity.  \n \nAmsparity contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Amsparity  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist has told you. Check with \nyour child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your child’s doctor may prescribe another \nstrength of Amsparity if your child needs a different dose. \n \nAmsparity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). \n \nChildren and adolescents with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 20 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity 40 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 20 mg every other week. \n \n\n\n\n183 \n\nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 40 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren and adolescents with psoriasis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 4 to 17 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is an initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg one week later. \nThereafter, the usual dose is 20 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 4 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is an initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg one week later. \nThereafter, the usual dose is 40 mg every other week. \n \nAdolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa from 12 to 17 years of age, weighing 30 kg or more  \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in one day), \nfollowed by 40 mg every other week starting one week later. If this dose does not work well enough, \nyour doctor may increase the dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nIt is recommended that you use an antiseptic wash daily on the affected areas.  \n \nChildren and adolescents with Crohn’s disease  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 to 17 years of age weighing less than 40 kg \n \nThe usual dose regimen is 40 mg initially followed by 20 mg two weeks later. If a faster response is \nrequired, your child’s doctor may prescribe an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in \none day) followed by 40 mg starting two weeks later.  \n \nThereafter, the usual dose is 20 mg every other week.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step.  \nDo not try to inject Amsparity to your child until you have read and understood the Instructions for \nUse. If your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist decides that you may be able to give injections of \nAmsparity to your child at home, you should receive training on the correct way to prepare and inject \nAmsparity. \n \nIt is also important to talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist to be sure you understand your \nchild’s Amsparity dosing instructions. To help you remember when to inject Amsparity, you can mark \nyour calendar ahead of time. Talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have any questions \nabout the correct way to inject Amsparity. \n \nAfter proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for example a \nfamily member or friend. \n \nFailure to perform the following steps as described may cause contamination which may lead to \ninfection of your child. \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. \n \n1) Setting up \n\n \n• Make sure you know the proper amount (volume) needed for dosing. If you do not know the \n\namount, STOP HERE and talk to your child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist for further \ninstruction. \n \n\n• You will need a special container for waste, such as a sharps container or as instructed by your \nchild’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Place the container on your work surface. \n \n\n• Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n\n• Remove one box containing one syringe, one vial adapter, one vial, two alcohol pads and one \nneedle from the carton. If there is a second box in the carton for a future injection, place it back \nin the refrigerator immediately. \n \n\n• Look at the expiry date on the box to be used. DO NOT use any item after the date shown on the \nbox. \n \n\n• Set up the following items on a clean surface, DO NOT take them out of their individual \npackaging yet. \n\n \no One 1 ml syringe (1) \no One vial adapter (2) \no One vial for paediatric use of Amsparity for injection (3) \no Two alcohol pads (4) \no One needle (5) \n\n \n\n\n\n192 \n\n \n \nAmsparity is a liquid that is clear and colourless to very light brown and free from flakes or particles. \nDO NOT use if the liquid has flakes or particles in it. \n \n2) Preparing the Amsparity dose for injection \n\n \nGeneral handling: DO NOT dispose of any waste items until after the injection is completed. \n\n \n• Prepare the needle by partially peeling the package open from the end closest to the yellow \n\nsyringe connector. Peel the package just far enough to expose the yellow syringe connector. Set \nthe package down with the clear side of the package facing up. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n• Pop off the plastic cap from the vial to see the top of the vial stopper. \n \n\n \n• Use one of the alcohol pads to wipe the vial stopper. DO NOT touch the vial stopper after \n\nwiping with the alcohol pad. \n \n\n• Peel the cover off the vial adapter package but do not take out the vial adapter. \n\n\n\n193 \n\n \n\n \n• Hold the vial with the vial stopper facing up. \n\n \n• With the vial adapter still in the clear package, attach it to the vial stopper by pushing down until \n\nthe vial adapter snaps in place. \n \n• When you are sure the adapter is attached to the vial, lift off the package from the vial adapter. \n\n \n• Gently set the vial with vial adapter down on your clean work surface. Be careful that it does not \n\nfall over. DO NOT touch the vial adapter. \n \n\n \n \n• Prepare the syringe by partially peeling the package open from the end closest to the white \n\nplunger rod. \n \n\n• Peel the clear package just far enough to expose the white plunger rod, but do not take the \nsyringe out of the package. \n \n\n• Hold the syringe package and SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the \nprescribed dose (For example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod to \n0.6 ml). NEVER pull past the 0.9 ml position regardless of prescribed dose. \n \n\n• You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in a later step. \n \n\n• DO NOT pull the white plunger rod completely out of the syringe. \n \nNOTE: \n\n \nIf the white plunger rod is pulled completely out of the syringe, discard the syringe and contact your \nchild’s Amsparity provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the white plunger rod. \n \n\n\n\n194 \n\n \n \n• DO NOT use the white plunger rod to remove the syringe from the package. Hold the syringe \n\non the graduated area and pull the syringe from its package. DO NOT set the syringe down at \nany time. \n \n\n• While holding the vial adapter firmly, insert the syringe tip into the vial adapter and twist the \nsyringe clockwise with one hand until firm. DO NOT over-tighten. \n\n \n \n\n• While holding the vial, push the white plunger rod all the way down. This step is important to \nget the proper dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nDose + 0.1 ml \n \n\n\n\n195 \n\n• Hold the white plunger rod in and turn the vial and syringe upside down. \n \n\n \n \n \n• SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose. This is \n\nimportant to get the proper dose. You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in step 4, Dose \nPreparation. If, for example the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod out to \n0.6 ml. You will see the liquid medication from the vial go into the syringe. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n• Push the white plunger rod all the way back in to push the liquid medication back into the vial. \n\nAgain, SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose, this is \nimportant to get the proper dose and important in order to prevent air bubbles or air gaps in the \nliquid medication. You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in step 4, Dose Preparation. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n196 \n\n \n• If you see remaining air bubbles or air gaps in the liquid medication in the syringe, you may \n\nrepeat this process up to 3 times. DO NOT shake the syringe. \n \nNOTE: \n \nIf the white plunger rod is pulled completely out of the syringe, discard the syringe and contact your \nAmsparity provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the white plunger rod. \n \n• While still holding the syringe upright at the graduated area, remove the vial adapter with the \n\nvial by twisting the vial adapter off with the other hand. Be sure to remove the vial adapter with \nthe vial from the syringe. DO NOT touch the tip of the syringe. \n\n \n \n\n \n• If a large air bubble or air gap can be seen near the syringe tip, SLOWLY push the white \n\nplunger rod into the syringe until fluid begins to enter the syringe tip. DO NOT push the white \nplunger rod past the dose position. \n \n\n• For example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, DO NOT push the white plunger rod past the \n0.5 ml position. \n \n\n• Check to see that the fluid remaining in the syringe is at least the prescribed dose volume. If the \nremaining volume is less than the prescribed dose volume, DO NOT use the syringe and talk to \nyour child’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n\n• With your free hand, pick up the needle package with the yellow syringe connector facing down. \n \n\n• Keeping the syringe up, insert the syringe tip into the yellow syringe connector and twist the \nsyringe as indicated by the arrow in the picture until firm. The needle is now attached to the \nsyringe. \n\n \n \n\n• Pull the needle package off, but DO NOT remove the clear needle cap. \n\n\n\n197 \n\n \n• Place the syringe on your clean work surface. Continue with injection site and dose preparation \n\nimmediately. \n \n3) Choosing and preparing an injection site \n \n• Choose a site on the thigh or stomach. DO NOT use the same site that was used for the last \n\ninjection. \n \n\n• The new injection site should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n• DO NOT inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. This may mean there is \n\nan infection and therefore you should talk to your child’s doctor. \n \n\no If your child has psoriasis, do not inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly \nskin patches or lesions on the skin. \n\n \n• To reduce the chance of infection, wipe the injection site with the other alcohol pad. DO NOT \n\ntouch the area again before injecting. \n \n4) Dose Preparation \n \n• Pick up the syringe with the needle pointing up. \n\n \n• Use your other hand to flip the pink needle cover down toward the syringe. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n198 \n\n \n• Remove the clear needle cap by pulling it straight up with your other hand. \n \n\n \n \n• The needle is clean. \n• DO NOT touch the needle. \n• DO NOT set the syringe down at any time after the clear needle cap is off. \n• DO NOT try to put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n• Hold the syringe at eye-level with the needle pointing up to see the amount clearly. Be careful \n\nnot to squirt the liquid medication into your eye. \n• Recheck the prescribed medication amount. \n• Push the white plunger rod gently into the syringe until the syringe contains the prescribed \n\namount of liquid. Excess liquid may come out of the needle while the white plunger rod is being \npushed. DO NOT wipe off the needle or the syringe. \n\n \n5) Injecting Amsparity \n \n• With the free hand, gently grasp the cleaned area of skin and hold firmly. \n• With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin. \n• With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin. \n• Let go of the skin in your hand. \n• Using slow and constant pressure, push the white plunger rod to inject the liquid medication \n\nuntil the syringe is empty. \n• When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to pull it out at the same \n\nangle as when it was inserted. \n• Check that your child’s medicine has completely emptied from the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n199 \n\n• Gently flip the pink needle cover up, over the needle and snap into place, and set the syringe \nwith needle on the work surface. DO NOT put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n• Using a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds. A little bleeding \n\nmay occur. DO NOT rub the injection site. Use a plaster if you want to. \n \n6) Throwing away supplies \n \n• You will need a special container for waste, such as a sharps container or as instructed by your \n\nchild’s doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• Put the syringe with needle, vial and vial adapter into a special sharps container. DO NOT put \n\nthese items into regular household waste. \n• The syringe, needle, vial and vial adapter MUST NEVER be reused. \n• Keep the special container out of the sight and reach of children at all times. \n• Throw away all other used items into your regular household waste. \n \n\n\n\n200 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nAmsparity 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\nadalimumab \n \n\n \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

What you need to know before you use Amsparity  \n3. How to use Amsparity  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Amsparity  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Amsparity is and what it is used for  \n \nAmsparity contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body’s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nAmsparity is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n• rheumatoid arthritis,  \n• polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,  \n• paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n• ankylosing spondylitis,  \n• axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  \n• psoriatic arthritis,  \n• psoriasis,  \n• hidradenitis suppurativa,  \n• Crohn’s disease,  \n• ulcerative colitis and  \n\n\n\n201 \n\n• non-infectious uveitis.  \n \nThe active ingredient in Amsparity, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved \nin the immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed \nabove. By attaching to TNFα, Amsparity blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these \ndiseases.  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \nIf these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Amsparity to treat your rheumatoid \narthritis.  \n \nAmsparity can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \nprevious methotrexate treatment.  \n \nAmsparity can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function.  \n \nUsually, Amsparity is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Amsparity can be given alone.  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first \nappears in childhood.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged \n2 to 17 years. Patients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Amsparity to treat their polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis.  \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where \ntendons join the bone. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \nPatients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Amsparity to treat their enthesitis-related \narthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n \nAmsparity is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \n\n\n\n202 \n\nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Amsparity to reduce the \nsigns and symptoms of your disease.  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Amsparity can slow down the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Amsparity is also used to treat \nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to \nthe skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable.  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful \ninflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that \nmay leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the \narmpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nAmsparity can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, you will be given Amsparity.  \n \nCrohn’s disease in adults and children  \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years.  \n \nIf you have Crohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough \nto these medicines, you will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s \ndisease.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Amsparity to \nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nmay lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines \nthat move across the field of vision). Amsparity works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n\n\n203 \n\n \nAmsparity is used to treat \n• adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. \n• children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye.  \n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Amsparity  \n \nDo not use Amsparity \n \n• if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \n\n• if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or \nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n \n\n• if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Amsparity. \n \nIt is important that you and your doctor record the brand name and batch number of your medication. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n• If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Amsparity and contact your doctor immediately, since in \nrare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening.  \n\n \nInfections \n \n• If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body \n\n(for example, leg ulcer), consult your doctor before starting Amsparity. If you are unsure, \ncontact your doctor.  \n\n \n• You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Amsparity treatment. This risk \n\nmay increase if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections (unusual infectious organisms) and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these \ninfections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as \nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily \nstopping Amsparity.  \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Amsparity. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for \n\n\n\n204 \n\nexample chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \nrecorded on your patient reminder card.  \n\n \n• It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have \n\nbeen in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.  \n \n• Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for \n\ntuberculosis.  \n \n• If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack of \n\nenergy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor \nimmediately.  \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n• Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic (found).  \n \n• Tell your doctor if you have infections which keep coming back or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections.  \n \n• You should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \n\nAmsparity. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n• Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of getting HBV. Your doctor should test you for \nHBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare \ncases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation \nof HBV infection can be life-threatening.  \n\n \nAge over 65 years \n \n• If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Amsparity. You \n\nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \nwith Amsparity. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as \nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.  \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedures \n \n• If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your doctor that you are taking \n\nAmsparity. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity.  \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n• If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Amsparity. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.  \n\n \nVaccination \n \n• Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that \n\nmay cause infections and should not be given during treatment with Amsparity. Check with your \n\n\n\n205 \n\ndoctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be given all \nthe scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Amsparity. If you \nreceive Amsparity while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an \ninfection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is \nimportant that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \nAmsparity use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any \nvaccine.  \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n• It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \n\nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Amsparity, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or \nbleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment.  \n\n \nCancer \n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNFα blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Amsparity the risk of \ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, an uncommon \nand severe type of lymphoma has been seen in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Amsparity. \n\n  \n• In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \n\nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor.  \n\n \n• There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNFα \nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether \ntreatment with a TNFα blocker is appropriate for you.  \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n• On rare occasions, treatment with Amsparity could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \nOther medicines and Amsparity  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nAmsparity can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n \n\n\n\n206 \n\nYou should not take Amsparity with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \ndue to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \nhave questions, please ask your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nYou should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at \nleast 5 months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n \nAmsparity should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n \nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive adalimumab. \n \nAmsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIf you receive Amsparity during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about \nyour Amsparity use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more \ninformation on vaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n \nDriving and using machines  \n \nAmsparity may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Amsparity.  \n \nAmsparity contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Amsparity  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor may prescribe another strength of Amsparity if you need a \ndifferent dose. \n \nAmsparity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is \n40 mg adalimumab given every other week as a single dose.  \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Amsparity. If your doctor determines \nthat methotrexate is inappropriate, Amsparity can be given alone.  \n \n\n\n\n207 \n\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Amsparity therapy, \nyour doctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 20 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 2 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 40 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with enthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 6 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 40 mg every other week.  \n \nAdults with psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with psoriasis is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in \none day), followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. You \nshould continue to inject Amsparity for as long as your doctor has told you. If this dose does not work \nwell enough, your doctor may increase the dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren and adolescents with plaque psoriasis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 4 to 17 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is an initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg one week later. \nThereafter, the usual dose is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 4 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is an initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg one week later. \nThereafter, the usual dose is 40 mg every other week. \n \nAdults with hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe usual dose regimen for hidradenitis suppurativa is an initial dose of 160 mg (as four 40 mg \ninjections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by an \n80 mg dose (as two 40 mg injections in one day) two weeks later.

Supplies you need \n \n• You will need the following supplies for each injection of Amsparity. Find a clean, flat surface \n\nto place the supplies on. \no 1 Amsparity pre-filled syringe in a tray, inside the carton \no 1 alcohol swab, inside the carton \no 1 cotton ball or gauze pad (not included in your Amsparity carton) \no A suitable sharps container (not included in your Amsparity carton). \nImportant: If you have any questions about your Amsparity pre-filled syringe or medicine, talk \nto your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n2. Getting ready \n \n• Remove Amsparity carton from the refrigerator. \n• Open the carton and take out the tray containing your pre-filled syringe. \n\n\n\n217 \n\n• Check your carton and tray; do not use if: \no the expiration date has passed \no it has been frozen or thawed \no it has been dropped, even if it looks undamaged \no it has been out of the refrigerator for more than 30 days \no it appears to be damaged \no the seals on a new carton are broken. \n\n• If any of the above apply, dispose of your pre-filled syringe in the same way as a used syringe. \nYou will need a new pre-filled syringe to give your injection. \n\n• Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry completely.  \nIf you have any questions about your medicine, please talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Peel back the paper seal on the tray. \n• Remove 1 pre-filled syringe from the tray and put the original carton with any unused pre-filled \n\nsyringes back in the refrigerator. \n• Do not use your syringe if it appears to be damaged. \n• Your pre-filled syringe may be used straight from the refrigerator. \n• You may find that using your pre-filled syringe at room temperature reduces stinging or \n\ndiscomfort. Leave your pre-filled syringe at room temperature away from direct sunlight for 15 \nto 30 minutes before your injection. \n\n• Do not remove the needle cover from your pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject. \nAlways hold the pre-filled syringe by the syringe barrel to prevent damage. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n218 \n\n \n \n \n• Look carefully at your medicine in the window.  \n• Gently tilt your pre-filled syringe back and forth to check the medicine. \n• Do not shake your pre-filled syringe. Shaking can damage your medicine. \n• Make sure the medicine in the pre-filled syringe is clear and colourless to very light brown and \n\nfree from flakes or particles. It is normal to see one or more air bubbles in the window. Do not \nattempt to remove air bubbles. \nIf you have any questions about your medicine, please talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. \n• Do not inject into bony areas or areas on your skin that are bruised, red, sore (tender) or hard. \n\nAvoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. \no If you have psoriasis, do not inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin \n\npatches or lesions on your skin. \n• Do not inject through your clothes. \n• Wipe the injection site with the alcohol swab. \n• Allow the injection site to dry. \n \n \n\n\n\n219 \n\n \n \n \n• Hold the pre-filled syringe by the syringe barrel. Carefully pull the needle cover straight off and \n\naway from your body when you are ready to inject. \n• It is normal to see a few drops of medicine at the needle tip when you remove the needle cover. \n• Throw the needle cover away into a sharps disposal container. \n\nNote: Be careful when you handle your pre-filled syringe to avoid an accidental needle stick \ninjury. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Gently pinch up a fold of skin in the cleaned injection site area. \n• Insert the needle to its full depth into the skin, at a 45 degree angle, as shown.  \n• After the needle is inserted, release the pinched skin. \n\nImportant: Do not re-insert the needle into your skin. If the needle has already been inserted \ninto the skin and you change your mind about where to inject, you will need a replacement \npre-filled syringe. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n220 \n\n \n \n \n\n• Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod all the way down until the barrel is \nempty. It usually takes 2 to 5 seconds to deliver the dose. \nNote: It is recommended to hold your pre-filled syringe in the skin for an additional 5 seconds \nafter the plunger has been pressed down completely. \n\n• Pull the needle out of the skin at the same angle at which it entered. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Check that your medicine has completely emptied from your pre-filled syringe. \n• Never re-insert the needle. \n• Never re-cap the needle. \n\nNote: If the grey stopper is not in the position shown, you may not have injected all of your \nmedicine. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist right away. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n221 \n\n \n \n \n• Dispose of the syringe straight away as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and in \n\naccordance with local health and safety laws. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n• Look closely at your injection site. If there is blood, use a clean cotton ball or gauze pad to press \n\nlightly on the injection area for a few seconds.  \n• Do not rub the site. \n\nNote: Store any unused syringes in the refrigerator in the original carton. \n \n \nSee over for \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n \n\n\n\n222 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nAmsparity 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n\nadalimumab \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

What Amsparity is and what it is used for  \n \nAmsparity contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body’s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nAmsparity is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n• rheumatoid arthritis,  \n• polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,  \n• paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n• ankylosing spondylitis,  \n• axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  \n• psoriatic arthritis,  \n• psoriasis,  \n• hidradenitis suppurativa,  \n• Crohn’s disease,  \n\n\n\n223 \n\n• ulcerative colitis and  \n• non-infectious uveitis.  \n \nThe active ingredient in Amsparity, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved \nin the immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed \nabove. By attaching to TNFα, Amsparity blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these \ndiseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \nIf these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Amsparity to treat your rheumatoid \narthritis.  \n \nAmsparity can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \nprevious methotrexate treatment.  \n \nAmsparity can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function.  \n \nUsually, Amsparity is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Amsparity can be given alone.  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first \nappears in childhood.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged \n2 to 17 years. Patients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Amsparity to treat their polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis.  \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPaediatric enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where \ntendons join the bone. \n \nAmsparity is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \nPatients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Amsparity to treat their enthesitis-related \narthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n \nAmsparity is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \n\n\n\n224 \n\nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Amsparity to reduce the \nsigns and symptoms of your disease.  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Amsparity can slow down the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Amsparity is also used to treat \nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to \nthe skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable.  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful \ninflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that \nmay leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the \narmpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nAmsparity can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, you will be given Amsparity.  \n \nCrohn’s disease in adults and children  \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years.  \n \nIf you have Crohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough \nto these medicines, you will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s \ndisease.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel.  \n \nAmsparity is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Amsparity to \nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nmay lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines \nthat move across the field of vision). Amsparity works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n\n\n225 \n\n \nAmsparity is used to treat \n• adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. \n• children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye.  \n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Amsparity  \n \nDo not use Amsparity  \n \n• if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \n\n• if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or \nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n \n\n• if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Amsparity.  \n \nIt is important that you and your doctor record the brand name and batch number of your medication. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n• If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Amsparity and contact your doctor immediately, since in \nrare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening.  \n\n \nInfections \n \n• If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body \n\n(for example, leg ulcer), consult your doctor before starting Amsparity. If you are unsure, \ncontact your doctor.  \n\n \n• You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Amsparity treatment. This risk \n\nmay increase if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections (unusual infectious organisms) and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these \ninfections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as \nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily \nstopping Amsparity.  \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Amsparity. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for \n\n\n\n226 \n\nexample chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \nrecorded on your patient reminder card.  \n\n \n• It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have \n\nbeen in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.  \n \n• Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for \n\ntuberculosis.  \n \n• If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack of \n\nenergy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor \nimmediately.  \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n• Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic (found).  \n \n• Tell your doctor if you have infections which keep coming back or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections.  \n \n• You should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \n\nAmsparity. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n• Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of getting HBV. Your doctor should test you for \nHBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare \ncases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation \nof HBV infection can be life-threatening.  \n\n \nAge over 65 years \n \n• If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Amsparity. You \n\nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \nwith Amsparity. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as \nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.  \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedures \n \n• If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your doctor that you are taking \n\nAmsparity. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity.  \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n• If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Amsparity. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.  \n\n \nVaccination \n \n• Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that \n\nmay cause infections and should not be given during treatment with Amsparity. Check with your \n\n\n\n227 \n\ndoctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be given all \nthe scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Amsparity. If you \nreceive Amsparity while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an \ninfection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is \nimportant that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \nAmsparity use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any \nvaccine.  \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n• It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \n\nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Amsparity, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or \nbleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment.  \n\n \nCancer \n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNFα blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Amsparity the risk of \ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, an uncommon \nand severe type of lymphoma has been seen in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Amsparity.  \n\n \n• In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \n\nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor.  \n\n \n• There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNFα \nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether \ntreatment with a TNFα blocker is appropriate for you.  \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n• On rare occasions, treatment with Amsparity could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \nOther medicines and Amsparity  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nAmsparity can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n \n\n\n\n228 \n\nYou should not take Amsparity with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \ndue to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \nhave questions, please ask your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nYou should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at \nleast 5 months after the last Amsparity treatment. \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n \nAmsparity should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n \nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive adalimumab. \n \nAmsparity can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIf you receive Amsparity during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about \nyour Amsparity use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more \ninformation on vaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n \nDriving and using machines  \n \nAmsparity may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Amsparity.  \n \nAmsparity contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Amsparity  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor may prescribe another strength of Amsparity if you need a \ndifferent dose. \n \nAmsparity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is \n40 mg adalimumab given every other week as a single dose.  \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Amsparity. If your doctor determines \nthat methotrexate is inappropriate, Amsparity can be given alone.  \n \n\n\n\n229 \n\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Amsparity therapy, \nyour doctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 20 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 2 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 40 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with enthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 6 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Amsparity is 40 mg every other week.  \n \nAdults with psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with psoriasis is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in \none day), followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose.

These instructions show step-by-step how to prepare and give an injection.  \nStore your Amsparity pen in the refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C.  \nStore Amsparity pen in the original carton until use to protect from direct sunlight. \nIf needed, for example when you are traveling, you may store Amsparity pen at room \ntemperature up to 30°C for up to 30 days. \nKeep Amsparity, injection supplies, and all other medicines out of the reach of children. \n \n \nAmsparity for injection comes in a disposable single use pen that contains a single dose of medicine. \nDo not try to inject Amsparity yourself until you have read and understood the Instructions for Use. If \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of \nAmsparity at home, you should receive training on the correct way to prepare and inject Amsparity. \nIt is also important to talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to be sure you understand your \nAmsparity dosing instructions. To help you remember when to inject Amsparity, you can mark your \ncalendar ahead of time. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you or your caregiver have any \nquestions about the correct way to inject Amsparity. \nAfter proper training, Amsparity for injection can be self-administered or given by a caregiver. \n \n1. Supplies you need \n\n \n• You will need the following supplies for each injection of Amsparity. Find a clean, flat surface \n\nto place the supplies on. \no 1 Amsparity pen, inside the carton \no 1 alcohol swab, inside the carton \no 1 cotton ball or gauze pad (not included in your Amsparity carton) \no A suitable sharps container (not included in your Amsparity carton). \nImportant: If you have any questions about your Amsparity pen or medicine, talk to your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n2. Getting ready \n \n• Remove the Amsparity carton from the refrigerator. \n• Take out 1 Amsparity pen and the alcohol swab. Keep your pen out of direct sunlight. Put the \n\noriginal carton with any unused pens back in the refrigerator. \n• Do not use your pen if: \n\no your pen or the carton containing the pen has been dropped, even if it looks undamaged \no it has been frozen or thawed \no it appears to be damaged  \no the seals on a new carton are broken \no it has been out of the refrigerator for more than 30 days \no the expiration date has passed. \n\n• If any of the above apply, dispose of your pen in the same way as a used pen. You will need a \nnew pen to give your injection. \n\n• Your pen may be used straight from the refrigerator. \n• You may find that using your pen at room temperature reduces stinging or discomfort. Leave \n\nyour pen at room temperature away from direct sunlight for 15 to 30 minutes before your \ninjection. \n\n• Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry completely.  \n• Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n239 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n• Look carefully at your medicine in the window.  \n• Gently tilt your pen back and forth to check the medicine.  \n• Do not shake your pen. Shaking can damage your medicine. \n• Make sure the medicine in the pen is clear and colourless to very light brown and free from \n\nflakes or particles. It is normal to see one or more air bubbles in the window. Do not attempt to \nremove air bubbles. \nIf you have any questions about your medicine, please talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. \n\n\n\n240 \n\n• Do not inject into bony areas or areas on your skin that are bruised, red, sore (tender) or hard. \nAvoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. \no If you have psoriasis, do not inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin \n\npatches or lesions on your skin. \n• Do not inject through your clothes. \n• Wipe the injection site with the alcohol swab. \n• Allow the injection site to dry. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Twist and pull off the cap.  \n• Throw the cap away into a sharps disposal container; it is not needed again. \n• It is normal to see a few drops of medicine at the needle tip when you remove the cap. \n\nCaution: Handle your pen with care to avoid an accidental needle stick injury. \nNote: The needle cover stays inside the cap after removal. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Push your pen firmly against the skin at 90 degrees, as shown. \nNote: The needle goes into the skin as you push your pen down. The injection button will \nunlock when you are pushing the pen down firmly enough. \n\n• Keep your pen pushed against the skin until Step 8. \nNote: Do not re-insert the needle into your skin if you change your mind about where to inject. \nYou will need a replacement pen if the needle has already been inserted into the skin. \n\n\n\n241 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Press the injection button all the way down and you will hear a click. You may take your finger \noff the injection button when the injection has started. \n\n• Keep holding your pen firmly against the skin while the orange bar moves across the window. \nThis usually takes 3 to 10 seconds to deliver the dose. \n\n• Wait for at least 5 more seconds after the 2nd click to allow the medicine to be absorbed. \nNote: If you cannot press down the injection button, it is because you are not pushing the pen \ndown firmly enough. Take your finger off the injection button and push your pen down more \nfirmly against the skin. Then try pushing the button again. If this does not work, stretching or \npinching the skin may make the injection site firmer, making pressing the injection button \neasier. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Do not remove your pen until you have waited at least 5 seconds after the 2nd click.  \n• Remove your pen from the skin. \n\nNote: After you remove your pen from the skin, the needle will be automatically covered. \n• If you see more than a small drop of medicine on the skin after your injection, next time you \n\ninject wait a little longer to remove the pen from the skin. \n \n \n\n\n\n242 \n\n \n \n \n\n• You should see an orange bar in the window. \n• If the window has not turned orange, or if it looks like the medicine is still injecting, this means \n\nyou have not received a full dose. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist right away. \n• Do not inject another dose. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n• Dispose of the pen straight away as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and in \naccordance with local health and safety laws. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n243 \n\n \n \n \n\n• Look closely at your injection site. If there is blood, use a clean cotton ball or gauze pad to press \nlightly on the injection area for a few seconds.  \n\n• Do not rub the injection site. \nNote: Store any unused pens in the refrigerator in the original carton. \n\n \n \nSee over for \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
