This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTrogarzo 200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 200 mg of ibalizumab (in 1.33 mL of solution). \n \nIbalizumab is produced in murine myeloma non-secreting (NS0) cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nColourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent aqueous solution. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrogarzo, in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of adults infected \nwith multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a \nsuppressive antiviral regimen (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of ibalizumab is a single loading dose of 2,000 mg followed by a maintenance \ndose of 800 mg every 2 weeks.  \n \nIf the treating physician determines there is no additional clinical benefit for the patient in terms of \nviral load reduction, discontinuation of ibalizumab treatment should be considered, see section 5.1. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a maintenance dose (800 mg) of ibalizumab is missed by 3 days or longer beyond the scheduled \ndosing day, a loading dose (2,000 mg) should be administered as early as possible. Resume \nmaintenance dosing (800 mg) every 2 weeks thereafter. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of ibalizumab in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years of age) have not been \nestablished.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ibalizumab in children under the age of 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nIntravenous use \n\nDiluted ibalizumab solution should be administered by a healthcare professional. \n\nIbalizumab should be administered as an intravenous infusion. Ibalizumab should not be administered \nas an intravenous push or bolus. \n\nThe duration of the first infusion (loading dose) should be no less than 30 minutes. If no infusion-\nassociated adverse reactions have occurred, the duration of the subsequent infusions (maintenance \ndoses) can be decreased to no less than 15 minutes. \n\nAfter the infusion is complete, flush with 30 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection.  \n\nAll patients must be observed during and for 1 hour after completion of ibalizumab administration for \nat least the first infusion. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be discontinued and appropriate \nmedical therapies should be administered. Prophylactic medication is not warranted prior to each \ninfusion. If the patient does not experience an infusion-associated adverse reaction, the post-infusion \nobservation time can be reduced to 15 minutes thereafter.  \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nTransmission of HIV \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (cART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of cART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. IRIS was reported in 2 subjects out of 153 treated with ibalizumab in Phase \n2b and 3 clinical studies (see section 4.8).   \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nIbalizumab contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each loading dose of 2,000 mg or \nmaintenance dose of 800 mg and therefore is essentially sodium-free.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Based on the mechanism of action and target-mediated \ndrug disposition of ibalizumab, it is not expected that ibalizumab will have pharmacokinetic drug-drug \ninteractions with other medicinal products.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nIt is recommended that women of childbearing potential use an effective method of contraception \nduring treatment.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of ibalizumab in pregnant women.  \n \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nHuman immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. Ibalizumab is not recommended \nduring pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ibalizumab/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be \nexcreted in breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \nafterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period and \nibalizumab should not be used during breast-feeding.  \n\nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n\nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of ibalizumab on human fertility.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIbalizumab has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness, nausea, fatigue \nand headache have been reported during treatment with ibalizumab (see section 4.8). Patients \nexperiencing these symptoms should be advised to use caution when driving or using machines until \nsymptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash (9.2%), diarrhoea (3.9%), dizziness (3.9%), \nheadache (3.9%), nausea (3.9%), fatigue (2.0%) and vomiting (2.0%).  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA tabulated list of adverse reactions is presented in Table 1. Frequencies are defined as very common \n(\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); \nvery rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 1.

In general, rashes had an early onset (i.e. within 1 to 3 weeks of the first dose of \nibalizumab), were mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within 1-3 weeks with continued \nibalizumab administration. In case of rash, it is recommended that the patient be monitored and \nsymptomatic therapy be initiated when appropriate (e.g. cortisteroids and/or anti-histamine medicinal \nproducts). \n \nOut of the 153 subjects in Phase 2b and 3 clinical studies, one subject experienced a severe rash \n(non-serious). This subject had 8 adverse reactions of rash, including 1 event of macular rash, 1 event \nof generalized rash and 6 events of maculo-papular rash at different times during treatment with \nibalizumab. No action was taken with ibalizumab in response to these events. \n \nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) \nOut of 153 subjects, two subjects developed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS; see \nsection 4.4) manifested as an exacerbation of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (serious) \nand of cryptococcal cutaneous infection (serious), respectively. Both subjects were discontinued from \nibalizumab treatment. \n \nHypersensitivity \nOne subject out of 153 was reported to have hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) on Day 21 (i.e. 7 days \nafter the 2nd infusion of ibalizumab). As a result, ibalizumab was discontinued.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nAll 153 subjects enrolled in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials were tested for the presence of \nanti-ibalizumab IgG antibodies throughout their participation. Only one subject was found to have \nanti-ibalizumab antibodies. The subject had no adverse reactions associated with the positive \nimmunogenicity result. The subject received ibalizumab therapy for an additional 1.5 years before \ndiscontinuing voluntarily with an undetectable viral load (<50 copies/mL).  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \nGrade 3 creatinine elevations occurred frequently in subjects with underlying renal disease, risk factors \nfor renal disease, and/or in subjects taking concomitant medications known to be nephrotoxic. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote to ibalizumab overdose. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the \npatient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and given appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment. Standard supportive measures should be applied as required, including \nmonitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals. ATC code: J05AX23 \n \nMechanism of action \n\nIbalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G type 4 (IgG4), is a CD4 domain \n2-directed HIV-1 inhibitor. Ibalizumab blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to \ndomain 2 of CD4 and interfering with the post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus \nparticles into host cells and preventing the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion. \n\nEpitope mapping studies indicate that ibalizumab binds to a conformational epitope located primarily \nin domain 2 of the extracellular portion of the CD4 receptor. This epitope is positioned on the surface \nof CD4 opposite to the site in domain 1 that is required for CD4 binding of the MHC class II \nmolecules and, therefore, does not interfere with CD4-mediated immune functions.  \n\nIbalizumab is active against HIV-1 group M isolates (subtypes A, B, C, D, E, or O). It is also active \nagainst HIV-1 resistant to currently approved antiretroviral medicinal products and exhibits \nantiretroviral activity against R5-tropic, X4-tropic, and dual-tropic HIV-1. \n\nPhenotypic and genotypic test results revealed no evidence of cross-resistance between ibalizumab and \nany of the approved classes of anti-retroviral medicinal products.  \n\nResistance \n\nDecreased susceptibility to ibalizumab, as defined by a decrease in Maximum Percent Inhibition \n(MPI), has been observed in most subjects experiencing virologic failure and may be associated with \ngenotypic changes in the HIV-1 envelope coding sequence that results in the loss of potential N-linked \nglycosylation sites (PNGS) in the V5 loop of gp120. No relevant remaining effect of ibalizumab is \nexpected in cases of resistance development. Decreased susceptibility to ibalizumab was a finding in \nthe majority of patients who experienced virologic failure up to week 24 in the pivotal study. \n\nDecreased susceptibility to ibalizumab does not alter susceptibility to other approved agents and does \nnot result in the selection of CD4-independent viral isolates.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nTrial TMB-301 \nPhase 3 trial TMB-301 was a single arm, multicenter clinical trial conducted in 40 heavily \ntreatment-experienced HIV-infected subjects with multidrug resistant HIV-1. Subjects were required \nto have a viral load greater than 1,000 copies/mL and documented resistance to at least one \nantiretroviral medication from three classes of antiretroviral medications as measured by resistance \ntesting. Subjects must have been treated with antiretrovirals for at least 6 months and be failing or had \nrecently failed therapy (i.e., in the last 8 weeks). \n\nThe trial was composed of three discrete periods: \n \n\n\u2022 Control period (Day 0 to Day 6): Subjects were either monitored on their current failing \ntherapy or received no therapy if they had failed and discontinued treatment within the \n8 weeks preceding screening. This was an observational period to establish baseline HIV viral \nload.  \n\n\u2022 Functional monotherapy period (Day 7 to Day 13): All subjects received a 2,000 mg loading \ndose of ibalizumab on Day 7. Subjects on a failing ART regimen continued to receive their \nfailing regimen in addition to the loading dose of ibalizumab. This period was to establish the \nvirologic activity of ibalizumab.    \n\n\u2022 Maintenance period (Day 14 to Week 25): On Day 14 of the treatment period, viral load was \nassessed for the primary endpoint, and thereafter the background regimen was optimized to \ninclude at least one drug to which the subject\u2019s virus was susceptible. The use of an \ninvestigational drug as a component of the optimized background regimen was allowed. \nBeginning at Day 21, an 800 mg maintenance dose of ibalizumab was administered every two \nweeks through Week 25. This period was to establish the safety and durability of virologic \nsuppression of ibalizumab when used in combination with an optimized background regimen. \n \n\nThe majority of subjects in Trial TMB-301 were male (85%), white (55%) and between 23 and \n65 years of age (mean [SD] age: 50.5 [11.0] years). At Baseline, median [Min - Max] viral load and \nCD4+ T cell counts were 35,350 [304 - 743,000] copies/mL and 73 [0 - 676] cells/mm3, respectively. \nThe subjects were heavily treatment-experienced: 53% of participants had been treated with 10 or \nmore antiretroviral drugs prior to trial enrolment; 98% percent had been treated with NRTIs, 98% with \nPIs, 80% with NNRTIs, 78% with INSTIs, 30% with gp41 fusion inhibitors, and 20% with CCR5 co-\nreceptor antagonists.   \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a \u2265 0.5 log10 decrease in viral \nload from the beginning to the end of the \u201cFunctional monotherapy period\u201d as compared to the \nproportion of subjects achieving a \u2265 0.5 log10 decrease from the beginning to the end of the \u201cControl \nperiod\u201d, as defined above.  The results of the primary endpoint analysis are shown in Table 2 below.   \n\nTable 2.

An increase in the mean number of CD4+ T-cells of \n62 cells/mm3 was observed from Baseline to Week 25 (Intent-To-Treat (ITT) analysis). Week 25 \n\n\n\n8 \n\noutcomes are shown in Table 3. Subjects with baseline CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 were less likely to \nachieve a HIV-1 RNA of < 200 copies/mL (or < 50 copies/mL) than subjects with > 50 cells/mm3. \n\nTable 3.

Demonstrating drug susceptibility by both genotypic and phenotypic \ntesting was required, when testing by both methods was technically feasible. As an example, an OSS of 2 would indicate \nthat the HIV-1 isolate tested was fully susceptible to two drugs in the OBR. \n\n \nTrial TNX-355.03 \nStudy TNX-355.03 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, 3-\narm safety and efficacy study in 82 subjects with HIV-1 and who were failing or had failed highly \nactive antiretroviral therapy. Subjects all received OBR plus 1 of the following regimens: alternating \nintravenous (IV) infusions of 15 mg/kg ibalizumab and placebo, weekly for the first 9 doses (through \nthe Week 8 visit), then IV infusions of 15 mg/kg ibalizumab every 2 weeks (Arm A); 10 mg/kg \nibalizumab IV infusions weekly for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), then IV infusions of \n10 mg/kg ibalizumab every 2 weeks (Arm B); or weekly placebo IV infusions for the first 9 doses \n(through the Week 8 visit), then IV infusions of placebo every 2 weeks (Placebo arm). Patients in all \nthree arms also received an OBR. As of Week 16, patients in Placebo arm who experienced virologic \nfailure had the option of receiving 15 mg/kg open-label ibalizumab every 2 weeks and/or switching to \na new OBR. Patients in Arm A and B arm who experienced virologic failure had the option of \nswitching to a new OBR. \n \nAt Week 2, the mean viral load decrease was 0.87 log10 copies/mL in Arm A, 1.15 log10 copies/mL in \nArm B and 0.38 log10 copies/mL in the Placebo arm (p=0.003 vs Arm A, p<0.001 vs Arm B). \n \nBy Week 16, i.e. prior to the possible switching of patients in the Placebo arm to the 15 mg/kg dose of \nibalizumab every 2 weeks and/or to change in OBR for all patients, mean viral load decrease was 1.07 \nlog10 copies/mL in Arm A, 1.33 log10 copies/mL in Arm B and 0.26 log10 copies/mL in the Placebo \narm  (p=0.002 vs Arm A, p<0.001 vs Arm B). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTrogarzo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n\nFollowing the recommended dose regimen (a single loading dose of 2,000 mg followed by a \nmaintenance dose of 800 mg every 2 weeks), ibalizumab concentrations reached steady-state levels \nafter the first 800 mg maintenance dose with mean trough concentrations over 30 \u00b5g/mL throughout \nthe dosing interval.  The median time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of 2,000 mg and \n800 mg is 1 hr and 10 min, respectively. Ibalizumab is administered as an IV infusion. The \nbioavailability is 100% by definition.   \n \nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of ibalizumab is approximately 4.8 L, which is comparable with vascular \nspace, based on the performed population pharmacokinetics analysis.  \n\nBiotransformation \n\nSpecific metabolism studies were not conducted because ibalizumab is a protein. Ibalizumab is \nexpected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. \n \nElimination \n\nFollowing single-dose administrations of 10 and 25 mg/kg of ibalizumab, clearance is 0.5 to \n0.36 mL/h/kg and elimination half-life is 37.8 and 64.1 hours, respectively. The elimination is \nnonlinear and concentration-dependent. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nIbalizumab administered as a single agent exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics at a dose range of \n0.3-25 mg/kg. Following administration of ibalizumab, at the clinically relevant dose rage of \n800-2,000 mg, the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) increased dose proportionally, whereas the \narea under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner. \nSuch non-linear effects in clearance are common for monoclonal antibodies targeting cell surface \nmolecules, such as CD4. This behaviour is characteristic of saturable (capacity-limited) elimination \nkinetics. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to explore the potential effects of selected \ncovariates (age, body weight, sex, baseline CD4+ cell count) on ibalizumab pharmacokinetics. The \nresults suggest that ibalizumab concentration decreases as body weight increases. The body weight \nrange was very narrow in the population PK model, and the impact of body weight may not be \nprecisely estimated. However, the effect is unlikely to impact virologic outcome and does not warrant \na dose adjustment. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof ibalizumab. Renal impairment is not anticipated to impact the pharmacokinetics of ibalizumab.  \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of ibalizumab. Hepatic impairment is not anticipated to impact the pharmacokinetics \nof ibalizumab.  \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nIbalizumab pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in paediatric patients. \n \nElderly population  \n\nIbalizumab pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years of age) is limited (n = 5). Results are \nsimilar to the adult population (\u226518 to 65 years of age), however no definite conclusions can be drawn. \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of in vitro and in \nvivo safety assessments. \n \nToxicity to reproduction and development \n\nA pre- and post-natal developmental study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys. Ibalizumab was \nadministered to pregnant females at a 110mg/kg weekly dose from gestation Day 20-22 until \nparturition (approximately 22 doses/animal). This dose was administered as it is at least 10-fold the \nestimated free clinical AUC and Cmax for the 800 mg Q2W dose. Ibalizumab was generally well \ntolerated in pregnant monkeys and in their offspring, when evaluated through 180 \u00b1 2 days post-\npartum. There were no ibalizumab-related adverse effects (maternal, foetal, or infant) at 110 mg/kg \n(No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level, NOAEL). However, CD4+ cells in infants of treated females \nwere temporarily suppressed from BD14-91 compared to control, but there was no further impact on \nimmunocompetence of the infants. The relevance of this effect for human pregnancy and lactation \nremains unknown. Under the conditions of this study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) \nfor developmental effects was 110 mg/kg.  \n \nGenotoxicity, carcinogenic potential \n\nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTrogarzo 200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \nibalizumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Trogarzo is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Trogarzo \n3. How to receive Trogarzo \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Trogarzo \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Trogarzo is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Trogarzo is \nTrogarzo contains the active substance ibalizumab. This is a type of protein called a \u2018monoclonal \nantibody\u2019 that can attach to a specific target in the body. It belongs to a group of medicines called \n\u2018antiretrovirals\u2019. \n \nWhat Trogarzo is used for \nTrogarzo is used in adults to treat HIV infection that has not responded to a number of HIV treatments \nin the past. \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Trogarzo to help control your HIV infection. \n \nTrogarzo is used in combination with other medicines.  \nIt will be used together with other HIV medicines called \u2018antiretrovirals\u2019.  \n \nHow Trogarzo works \nThe HIV virus infects cells in your blood called \u2018CD4\u2019 or \u2018T-cells\u2019. Trogarzo attaches to the CD4 \nreceptor and blocks HIV from entering and infecting your blood cells. This will reduce the amount of \nvirus in your body, and keeps it at a low level. This helps your body to increase the CD4 cell count in \nyour blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight \ninfection. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Trogarzo  \n \nYou must not be given Trogarzo: \n- if you are allergic to ibalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).  \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before being given Trogarzo. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nLook out for side effects \nTrogarzo can cause serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight away. \nThese include: \n\u2022 signs of a new infection (called \u2018immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\u2019)   \nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the above (for more information see \u2018Serious \nside effects\u2019 in section 4).  \n \nPassing HIV to others \nThis medicine reduces the amount of HIV in your body. When this is stably kept at undetectable \nlevels, the chances that you can still pass on HIV to your sexual partners become negligible. You can \nstill pass on HIV when taking this medicine, if you have detectable levels of HIV in your body. Talk to \nyour doctor or nurse about how to avoid infecting other people. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because Trogarzo \nhas not been studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Trogarzo \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. \n \nIf you could get pregnant while taking Trogarzo, you need to use a reliable method of barrier \ncontraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral \ncontraceptive (the pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants or injections), to \nprevent pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast feed because HIV infection can be passed on to the \nbaby in breast milk. It is unknown if Trogarzo can pass into breast milk. \nIf you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor immediately.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines after you have been given Trogarzo if you do not feel well enough. \nHeadache, feeling dizzy, feeling sick (nausea) or feeling tired are common side effects of Trogarzo and \ncan affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n  \nTrogarzo has a low sodium content \nTrogarzo contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose and therefore is essentially \nsodium-free. \n \n \n3. How to receive Trogarzo \n \nYou will be given Trogarzo under the supervision of an experienced doctor or nurse.  \n \nTrogarzo is used in combination with other medicines called \u2018antiretrovirals\u2019. \n \nHow much Trogarzo you will be given \nThe recommended dose of Trogarzo is: \n\u2022 a single dose of 2,000 mg on the first occasion \n\u2022 followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg every 2 weeks.  \n\n\n\n24 \n\nTrogarzo will be added to a drip (infusion bag) containing a sodium chloride (saline) solution before \nuse.  \n\nMore than one vial of Trogarzo will be needed to get the required dose. \n\n \nHow you will be given Trogarzo \nThe drip (infusion) will be given into a vein over 15 to 30 minutes. Your doctor or nurse will monitor \nyou during the Trogarzo infusion and for a period of time after your infusion.  \n \nIf you miss a dose of Trogarzo \n\u2022 It is very important that you are given Trogarzo every 2 weeks as instructed by your doctor.  \n\u2022 Do not change the schedule of your Trogarzo infusions or any of your other antiretroviral \n\nmedicines without talking to your doctor first.  \n\u2022 If you miss an appointment, ask your doctor straight away when to schedule your next dose. \n \nIf you stop having Trogarzo \nKeep having Trogarzo infusions until your doctor tells you to stop. If you stop and there is a gap in \nyour treatment, the level of HIV virus in your blood may begin to rise. This is less likely if you receive \nTrogarzo regularly and without gaps in treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \nTalk to your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the following serious side effects: \n\u2022 Signs of a new infection, changes in your immune system, can happen when you start using \n\nHIV medicines. Your immune system might get stronger and begin to fight infections that have \nbeen hidden in your body for a long time (this is called \u2018immune reconstitution inflammatory \nsyndrome\u2019). Look out for new signs of infection after receiving Trogarzo; these can be different \nfrom person to person depending on the type of infection that was hidden and might include fever, \nheadache, difficulty breathing, stomach ache, coughing and swollen glands (lumps and bumps on \nyour body, neck, armpit or groin).  \n\n\u2022 Allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). \n \nOther side effects \nTell your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\u2022 skin rash \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea  \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) \n\n\u2022 dizziness \n\n\u2022 headache \n\n\u2022 feeling tired  \n\n\u2022 dry skin  \n\n\u2022 dermatitis \u2013 a type of eczema with dry itchy skin  \n\n\u2022 pain and feeling numb in hands, feet or legs \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n\u2022 tremor \n\n\u2022 feeling dizzy, faint or light headed when standing up  \n\n\u2022 dry mouth  \n\n\u2022 feeling hot \n\n\u2022 spots or swelling  \n\n\u2022 itchy skin, or skin damage  \n\u2022 bruising  \n\n\u2022 abnormal heartbeat \n\n\u2022 high blood pressure or frequent changes in blood pressure  \n \nSeen in tests: \n\n\u2022 abnormal results on tests of the heart\u2019s electrical activity (electrocardiogram) \n\n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the side effects listed above. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.

nurse straight away if you get any of the above (for more information see 'serious side effects' in section 4). passing hiv to others this medicine reduces the amount of hiv in your body. when this is stably kept at undetectable levels, the chances that you can still pass on hiv to your sexual partners become negligible. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, if you have detectable levels of hiv in your body. talk to your doctor or nurse about how to avoid infecting other people. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of

if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. if you could get pregnant while taking trogarzo, you need to use a reliable method of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral contraceptive (the pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants or injections), to prevent pregnancy. breast-feeding women who are hiv-positive must not breast feed because hiv infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk. it is unknown if trogarzo can pass into breast milk. if you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \u2192 talk to your doctor immediately. driving and using machines do not drive or use machines after you have been given trogarzo if you do not feel well enough. headache, feeling dizzy, feeling sick (nausea) or feeling tired are common side effects of trogarzo and can affect your ability to drive or use machines.
