NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAgenerase 50 mg soft capsules. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 50 mg of amprenavir.  \n \nExcipients: \nd-sorbitol (E420) \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSoft capsule. \n \nOblong, opaque, off-white to cream coloured, printed with ‘GX CC1’. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAgenerase, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of protease \ninhibitor (PI) experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 4 years. Agenerase \ncapsules should normally be administered with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of \namprenavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). The choice of amprenavir should be based on individual viral \nresistance testing and treatment history of patients (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit of Agenerase boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated in PI naïve patients (see \nsection 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nThe importance of complying with the full recommended dosing regimen should be stressed to all \npatients. \n \nAgenerase is administered orally and can be taken with or without food. \n \nAgenerase is also available as an oral solution for use in children or adults unable to swallow capsules. \nAmprenavir is 14 % less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, \nAgenerase capsules and Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram \nbasis (see section 5.2). \n \nAdults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older (greater than 50 kg body weight): the \nrecommended dose of Agenerase capsules is 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nIf Agenerase capsules are used without the boosting effect of ritonavir higher doses of Agenerase \n(1200 mg twice daily) should be used. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\nChildren (4 to 12 years) and patients less than 50 kg body weight: the recommended dose of \nAgenerase capsules is 20 mg/kg body weight twice a day, in combination with other antiretroviral \nagents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2400 mg (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or \nother protease inhibitors have not yet been evaluated in children. Therefore, such combinations should \nbe avoided in children. \n \nChildren less than 4 years of age: Agenerase is not recommended in children below 4 years due to lack \nof data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly: the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amprenavir have not been studied in patients \nover 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment: no dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: the principal route of metabolism of amprenavir is via the liver. Agenerase \ncapsules should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Clinical efficacy and safety \nhave not been determined in this patient group. For subjects with hepatic impairment, pharmacokinetic \ndata are available for the use of Agenerase capsules without the boosting effect of ritonavir. Based on \npharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day for \nadult patients with moderate hepatic impairment and to 300 mg twice a day for adult patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. No dose recommendation can be made in children with hepatic impairment \n(see section 5.2). \n \nThe use of amprenavir in combination with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. No dose recommendations can be made regarding this combination. Concomitant \nadministration should be used with caution in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and \nis contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  \n \nAgenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Co-administration may result in \ncompetitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicinal products and create the potential for \nserious and/or life-threatening adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. amiodarone, bepridil, \nquinidine, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide), respiratory depression and /or prolonged \nsedation (e.g. oral triazolam and oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam,  \nsee section 4.5)) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia and ischaemia of other tissues, including \ncerebral or myocardial ischaemia (e.g. ergot derivatives). \n \nAgenerase in combination with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nCombination of rifampicin with Agenerase with concomitant low-dose ritonavir is contraindicated. \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAgenerase with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products with narrow \ntherapeutic windows that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, e.g. flecainide and \npropafenone (see section 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \namprenavir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of \namprenavir (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients should be advised that Agenerase, or any other current antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. \nCurrent antiretroviral therapies, including Agenerase, have not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. Appropriate precautions \nshould continue to be taken. \n \nOn the basis of current pharmacodynamic data, amprenavir should be used in combination with at \nleast two other antiretrovirals. When amprenavir is administered as monotherapy, resistant viruses \nrapidly emerge (see section 5.1). Agenerase capsules should normally be given in combination with \nlow dose ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral agents (see section 4.2). \n \nLiver Disease: The safety and efficacy of amprenavir has not been established in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders. Agenerase capsules are contraindicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment when used in combination with ritonavir (see section 4.3). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or \nC, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nMedicinal products – interactions \n \nConcomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the \nrisk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nThe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for \nmetabolism, thus concomitant use of Agenerase with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended \ndue to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Caution must also be exercised if \nAgenerase is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is metabolized to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. \nIn this situation, a reduced dose of atorvastatin should be considered. If treatment with a HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin are recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nFor some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International \nNormalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential \nsafety problems with concomitant use. \n \nThe use of Agenerase concomitantly with halofantrine or lidocaine (systemic) is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) should be used with caution. Agenerase \nmay be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these \nmedicinal products concomitantly (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant medicinal products \n(cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin) when co-administered with Agenerase (see section 4.5). \n \nCaution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and \nvardenafil) (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nCaution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with delavirdine (see section 4.5). \n \nA reduction of rifabutin dosage of at least 50 % is recommended when administered with Agenerase. \nWhen ritonavir is co-administered further dose reduction may be necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nBecause of the potential for metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal \ncontraceptives may be modified, but there is insufficient information to predict the nature of the \ninteractions. Therefore, alternative reliable methods of contraception are recommended for women of \nchildbearing potential (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of amprenavir with methadone leads to a decrease of methadone concentrations. \nTherefore, when methadone is co-administered with amprenavir, patients should be monitored for \nopiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose ritonavir is also given. No recommendations can \ncurrently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose when amprenavir is co-administered with \nmethadone. \n \nAgenerase capsules contain vitamin E (36 IU/50 mg capsule), therefore additional vitamin E \nsupplementation is not recommended. \n \nAgenerase capsules also contain sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n \nDue to the potential risk of toxicity from the high propylene glycol content of Agenerase oral solution, \nthis formulation is contraindicated in children below the age of four years and should be used with \ncaution in certain other patient populations. The Summary of Product Characteristics of Agenerase \noral solution should be consulted for full prescribing information. \n \nRash / cutaneous reactions \n \nMost patients with mild or moderate rash can continue Agenerase. Appropriate antihistamines (e.g. \ncetirizine dihydrochloride) may reduce pruritus and hasten the resolution of rash. Agenerase should be \npermanently discontinued when rash is accompanied with systemic symptoms or allergic symptoms or \nmucosal involvement (see section 4.8). \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nNew onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbations of existing diabetes mellitus have \nbeen reported in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors. In some of \nthese, the hyperglycaemia was severe and in some cases also associated with ketoacidosis. Many of \nthe patients had confounding medical conditions, some of which required therapy with agents that \nhave been associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia. \n \nLipodystrophy \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat \n(lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. \nKnowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis and \nprotease inhibitors and lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been \nhypothesised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older \nage, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated \nmetabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat \nredistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood \nglucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8). \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nHaemophiliac patients \n \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some \npatients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued, or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.  \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have been performed with amprenavir as the sole protease inhibitor. When \namprenavir and ritonavir are co-administered, the ritonavir metabolic drug interaction profile may \npredominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 \nand induces CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and glucuronosyl transferase. The full prescribing \ninformation for ritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Agenerase and \nritonavir. \n \nAmprenavir and ritonavir are primarily metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal \nproducts that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may modify the \npharmacokinetics of amprenavir. Similarly, amprenavir and ritonavir might also modify the \npharmacokinetics of other medicinal products that share this metabolic pathway. \n \nAssociations contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nCYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index \nAgenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows containing active substances that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). \nCo-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these active substances \nthus increasing their plasma level and leading to serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions \nsuch as cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, \nterfenadine) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine). \n \nCYP2D6 substrates with narrow therapeutic index \nAgenerase with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products containing active \nsubstances that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism and for which elevated plasma \nconcentrations are associated with serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions. These active \nsubstances include flecainide and propafenone. \nRifampicin \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n7 \n\nRifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause an 82% decrease in amprenavir \nAUC, which can result in virological failure and resistance development. During attempts to overcome \nthe decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high \nfrequency of liver reactions was seen. The combination of rifampicin and Agenerase with concomitant \nlow-dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \nSerum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by concomitant use of the herbal preparation St John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum). This is due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes by St John’s \nwort. Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort should therefore not be combined with Agenerase. \nIf a patient is already taking St John’s wort, check amprenavir and if possible viral levels and stop St \nJohn’s wort. Amprenavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s wort. The dose of amprenavir may \nneed adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St \nJohn’s wort. \n  \n• Other combinations \n \nOf note, the following interaction data was obtained in adults. \n \nAntiretroviral agents \n \n• Protease inhibitors (PIs): \n \nIndinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of indinavir were decreased by 38 %, 27 %, and 22 %, respectively, \nwhen given with amprenavir.  The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. The AUC, Cmin and \nCmax of amprenavir were increased by 33 %, 25 %, and 18 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is \nnecessary for either medicinal product when indinavir is administered in combination with \namprenavir. \n \nSaquinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of saquinavir were decreased by 19 % and 48 % and increased by \n21 %, respectively, when given with amprenavir.  The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. \nThe AUC, Cmin and Cmax of amprenavir were decreased by 32 %, 14 %, and 37 %, respectively. No \ndose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when saquinavir is administered in \ncombination with amprenavir. \n \nNelfinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of nelfinavir were increased by 15 %, 14 %, and 12 %, \nrespectively, when given with amprenavir. The Cmax of amprenavir was decreased by 14 % whilst the \nAUC and Cmin were increased by 9 % and 189 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is necessary for \neither medicinal product when nelfinavir is administered in combination with amprenavir (see also \nefavirenz below). \n \nRitonavir: the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the \nCmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was co-administered with amprenavir \ncapsule (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of \namprenavir capsules. In clinical trials, doses of amprenavir 600 mg twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily have been used; confirming the safety and efficacy of this regimen.  \n \nLopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra): in an open-label, non-fasting pharmacokinetic study, the AUC, Cmax \nand Cmin of lopinavir were decreased by 38%, 28% and 52% respectively when amprenavir (750 mg \ntwice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily). \nIn the same study, the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of amprenavir were increased 72%, 12%, and 483%, \nrespectively, when compared to values after standard doses of amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily). \n \nThe amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) \nin combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40-\n50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily. Adding additional ritonavir to an amprenavir plus Kaletra regimen increase lopinavir Cmin \nvalues, but not amprenavir Cmin values. No dose recommendation can be given for the co-\n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n8 \n\nadministration of amprenavir and Kaletra, but close monitoring is advised because the safety and \nefficacy of this combination is unknown. \n \n• Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs):  \n \nZidovudine: the AUC and Cmax of zidovudine were increased by 31 % and 40 %, respectively, when \ngiven with amprenavir. The AUC and the Cmax of amprenavir were unaltered. No dose adjustment for \neither medicinal product is necessary when zidovudine is administered in combination with \namprenavir. \n \nLamivudine: the AUC and Cmax of lamivudine and amprenavir, respectively, were both unaltered  \nwhen these two medicinal products were given concomitantly. No dose adjustment is necessary for \neither medicinal product when lamivudine is administered in combination with amprenavir. \n \nAbacavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of abacavir were unaltered when given with amprenavir. The AUC, \nCmin and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 29 %, 27 %, and 47 %, respectively. No dose \nadjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when abacavir is administered in combination \nwith amprenavir. \n \nDidanosine: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with \ndidanosine, however, due to its antacid component, it is recommended that didanosine and Agenerase \nshould be administered at least one hour apart (see Antacids below). \n \n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): \n \nEfavirenz: efavirenz has been seen to decrease the Cmax, AUC and Cmin,ss of amprenavir by \napproximately 40 % in adults. When amprenavir is combined with ritonavir, the effect of efavirenz is \ncompensated by the pharmacokinetic booster effect of ritonavir. Therefore, if efavirenz is given in \ncombination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose \nadjustment is necessary.  \n \nFurther, if efavirenz is given in combination with amprenavir and nelfinavir, no dosage adjustment is \nnecessary for any of the medicinal products.  \n \nTreatment with efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the \nexposure to both protease inhibitors would be decreased. \n \nNo dose recommendation can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir with another protease \ninhibitor and efavirenz in children. Such combinations should be avoided in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nNevirapine: The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and the limited evidence available \nsuggest that nevirapine may decrease the serum concentrations of amprenavir. \n \nDelavirdine: the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of delavirdine were decreased by 61%, 47% and 88% \nrespectively when given with amprenavir. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by \n130%, 40% and 125% respectively.  \n \nNo dose recommendations can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir and delavirdine. If \nthese medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, as delavirdine may be less effective \ndue to decreased and potentially sub-therapeutic plasma concentrations. \n \nNo dose recommendations can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir and low dose \nritonavir with delavirdine. If these medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, and \nclose clinical and virological monitoring should be performed since it is difficult to predict the effect \nof the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirdine. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\nAntibiotics/antifungals \n \nRifabutin: co-administration of amprenavir with rifabutin resulted in a 193 % increase in rifabutin \nAUC and an increase of rifabutin-related adverse events. The increase in rifabutin plasma \nconcentration is likely to result from inhibition of rifabutin CYP3A4 mediated metabolism by \namprenavir. When it is clinically necessary to co-administer rifabutin with Agenerase, a dosage \nreduction of at least half the recommended dose of rifabutin is advised, although no clinical data are \navailable. When ritonavir is co-administered a larger increase in rifabutin concentration may occur. \n \nClarithromycin: the AUC and Cmin of clarithromycin were unaltered and the Cmax decreased by 10 % \nwhen given with amprenavir. The AUC, Cmin and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 18 %, 39 % \nand 15 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when \nclarithromycin is administered in combination with amprenavir. When ritonavir is co-administered an \nincrease in clarithromycin concentrations may occur. \n \nErythromycin: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with \nerythromycin, however, plasma levels of both medicinal products may be increased when  \nco-administered. \n \nKetoconazole / Itraconazole: the AUC and Cmax of ketoconazole were increased by 44 % and 19 %, \nrespectively when given with amprenavir alone. The AUC and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by \n31 % and decreased by 16 %, respectively. Itraconazole concentrations are expected to increase in the \nsame manner as ketoconazole. No dose adjustment for any of the medicinal products is necessary \nwhen either ketoconazole or itraconazole is administered in combination with amprenavir. Co-\nadministration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 200 mg \nonce daily increased plasma ketoconazole Cmax by 25 % and increased AUC(0-τ) to values 2.69-fold \nthose observed on administration of ketoconazole 200 mg once daily without concurrent \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir.  The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were unchanged. When used \nwith Agenerase with ritonavir, high doses (>200 mg/day) of ketoconazole or itraconazole are not \nrecommended. \n \nOther possible interactions \n \nOther medicinal products, listed below, including examples of substrates, inhibitors or inducers of \nCYP3A4, may lead to interactions when administered with Agenerase. The clinical significance of \nthese possible interactions is not known and has not been investigated. Patients should therefore be \nmonitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicinal products when these are administered in \ncombination with Agenerase. \n \nAntacids: on the basis of the data for other protease inhibitors, it is advisable not to take antacids at the \nsame time as Agenerase, since its absorption may be impaired. It is recommended that antacids and \nAgenerase should be administered at least one hour apart.  \n \nAnticonvulsant active substances: concomitant administration of anticonvulsant active substances \nknown as enzymatic inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) with amprenavir may lead \nto a decrease in the plasma concentrations of amprenavir. These combinations should be used with \ncaution and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nCalcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium \nchannel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, \nnimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these \nmedicinal products. \n \nErectile dysfunction agents: based on data for other protease inhibitors caution should be used when \nprescribing PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and vardenafil) to patients receiving Agenerase. Co-\nadministration with Agenerase may substantially increase PDE5 inhibitor plasma concentrations and \nassociated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n10 \n\n \nFluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg \ncapsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 \ndays in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the \nintrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86 % (90 % confidence interval 82-89 %). Greater \neffects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects \nincluding Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving \nritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with \nother corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide. Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of Agenerase with ritonavir and these glucocorticoids is not recommended \nunless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see \nsection 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of \nlocal and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may \nhave to be performed over a longer period. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on \nritonavir plasma levels is yet unknown. \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on \nCYP3A4 for metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased \nplasma concentrations when co-administered with Agenerase. Since increased concentrations of \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of \nthese medicinal products with Agenerase is not recommended. Atorvastatin is less dependent on \nCYP3A4 for metabolism. When used with Agenerase, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should \nbe administered. The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A4, and \ninteractions are not expected with protease inhibitors. If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended. \n \nImmunosuppressants: frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring of immunosuppresant levels is \nrecommended until levels have stabilised as plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and \ntacrolimus may be increased when co-administered with amprenavir (see section 4.4). \n \nMidazolam: midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration with Agenerase \nwith or without ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No \ndrug interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of Agenerase with \nbenzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are \nexpected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore Agenerase should not \nbe co-administered with orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be \nused with co-administration of Agenerase and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of \nparenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam \nplasma levels. If Agenerase with or without ritonavir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical \nmonitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged \nsedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single \ndose of midazolam is administered. \n \nMethadone and opiate derivatives: co-administration of methadone with amprenavir resulted in a \ndecrease in the Cmax and AUC of the active methadone enantiomer (R-enantiomer) of 25% and 13% \nrespectively, whilst the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the inactive methadone enantiomer (S-enantiomer) \nwere decreased by 48%, 40% and 23% respectively. When methadone is co-administered with \namprenavir, patients should be monitored for opiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose \nritonavir is also given. \n \nAs compared to a non-matched historical control group, co-administration of methadone and \namprenavir resulted in a 30%, 27% and 25% decrease in serum amprenavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin \nrespectively. No recommendations can currently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose \nwhen amprenavir is co-administered with methadone due to the inherent low reliability of non-\nmatched historical controls.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\n \nOral anticoagulants: a reinforced monitoring of the International Normalised Ratio is recommended in \ncase of administration of Agenerase with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to a possible \ndecrease or increase of their antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4). \n \nSteroids: oestrogens and progestogens may interact with amprenavir. However, the information \ncurrently available is not sufficient for determining the nature of the interaction. Co-administration of \n0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg norethindrone resulted in a decrease of the amprenavir AUC \nand Cmin of 22% and 20% respectively, Cmax being unchanged. The Cmin of ethinyl estradiol was \nincreased by 32%, whilst the AUC and Cmin of norethindrone were increased by 18% and 45% \nrespectively. Alternative methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing \npotential. When ritonavir is co-administered, the effect on hormonal contraceptive concentrations \ncannot be predicted, therefore, alternative methods of contraception are also recommended. \n \nTricyclic antidepressants: careful monitoring of the therapeutic and adverse reactions of tricyclic \nantidepressants is recommended when they (for example desipramine and nortriptyline) are \nconcomitantly administered with Agenerase (see section 4.4). \n \nParoxetine: plasma concentrations of paroxetine may be significantly decreased when co-administered \nwith amprenavir and ritonavir.  The mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. Based on \nhistorical comparison, amprenavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by paroxetine. \nTherefore, if paroxetine is co-administered with Agenerase and ritonavir, the recommended approach \nis a dose titration of paroxetine based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response. In addition, \npatients on stable dose of paroxetine who start treatment with Agenerase and ritonavir should be \nmonitored for antidepressant response. \n \nOther substances: plasma concentrations of other substances may be increased by amprenavir. These \ninclude substances such as: clozapine, cimetidine, dapsone and loratadine. \nSome substances (e.g. lidocaine (by systemic route) and halofantrine) given with Agenerase may \ncause serious adverse reactions. Concomitant use is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: there are no adequate data from the use of amprenavir in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nThis medicinal product should be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential \nbenefits compared to the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nLactation: amprenavir-related material was found in rat milk, but it is not known whether amprenavir \nis excreted in human milk. A reproduction study in pregnant rats dosed from the time of uterine \nimplantation through lactation showed reduced body weight gains in the offspring during the nursing \nperiod.  The systemic exposure to the dams associated with this finding was similar to exposure in \nhumans, following administration of the recommended dose.  The subsequent development of the \noffspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by the maternal \nadministration of amprenavir. \n \nIt is therefore recommended that mothers being treated with Agenerase do not breast-feed their \ninfants.  Additionally, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast feed their infants in \norder to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\nThe safety of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children at least 4 years of age, in controlled \nclinical trials, in combination with various other antiretroviral agents. Adverse events considered \nassociated with the use of Agenerase are gastro-intestinal symptoms, rash and oral/peri-oral \nparaesthesia. Most undesirable effects associated with Agenerase therapy were mild to moderate in \nseverity, early in onset, and rarely treatment limiting. For many of these events, it is unclear whether \nthey are related to Agenerase, to concomitant treatment used in the management of HIV disease or to \nthe disease process.  \n \nIn children, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. The \nfrequency categories used are: \n \nVery common  ≥ 1 in 10 \nCommon  ≥ 1 in 100 and < 1 in 10 \nUncommon  ≥ 1 in 1,000 and < 1 in 100 \nRare   ≥1 in 10,000 and < 1 in 1,000 \n \nFrequency categories for the events below have been based on clinical trials and postmarketing data.  \n \nMost of the adverse events below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) \ninvolving PI naïve subjects receiving Agenerase 1200mg twice daily. Events (grade 2-4) reported by \nstudy investigators as attributable to study medication and occurring in >1% of patients, are included \nas well as grade 3-4 treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities. Note that the background rates in \ncomparator groups were not taken into account. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nCommon: Elevated triglycerides, elevated amylase, abnormal fat redistribution, anorexia \nUncommon:  Hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolaemia \n \nElevated triglycerides, elevated amylase and hyperglycaemia (grade 3-4) were reported primarily in \npatients with abnormal values at baseline. \n \nElevations in cholesterol were of grade 3-4 intensity. \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) \nin HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal \nand visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump). \n \nSymptoms of abnormal fat redistribution were infrequent in PROAB3001 with amprenavir. Only one \ncase (a buffalo hump) was reported in 113 (< 1 %) antiretroviral naive subjects treated with \namprenavir in combination with lamivudine/zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks. In study \nPROAB3006, seven cases (3 %) were reported in 245 NRTI-experienced subjects treated with \namprenavir and in 27 (11 %) of 241 subjects treated with indinavir, in combination with various \nNRTIs for a median duration of 56 weeks (p< 0.001). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as \nhypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and \nhyperlactataemia (see section 4.4). \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nCommon:  Mood disorders, depressive disorders \n \nNervous system disorders \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n13 \n\nVery Common:  Headache \nCommon:  Oral/perioral paraesthesia, tremors, sleep disorders \n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n \nVery Common:  Diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, dyspeptic symptoms, loose stools \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nCommon:  Elevated transaminases \nUncommon:  Hyperbilirubinaemia \n \nElevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinaemia (grade 3-4) were reported primarily in patients with \nabnormal values at baseline. Almost all subjects with abnormal liver function tests were co-infected \nwith Hepatitis B or C virus.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n \nVery Common:   Rash \nUncommon:  Angioedema \nRare:   Stevens Johnson syndrome \n \nRashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapular cutaneous eruptions, with or \nwithout pruritus, occurring during the second week of therapy and resolving spontaneously within two \nweeks, without discontinuation of treatment with amprenavir. A higher incidence of rash was reported \nin patients treated with amprenavir in combination with efavirenz. Severe or life-threatening skin \nreactions have also occurred in patients treated with amprenavir (see section 4.4). \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis, and rarely rhabdomyolysis have been reported with protease \ninhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues. \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery Common:  Fatigue \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise (see section 4.4). \n \nIn PI experienced patients receiving Agenerase capsules 600 mg twice daily and low dose ritonavir, \n100 mg twice daily, the nature and frequency of adverse events (grade 2-4) and Grade 3/4 laboratory \nabnormalities were similar to those observed with Agenerase alone, with the exception of elevated \ntriglyceride levels, and elevated CPK levels which were very common in patients receiving Agenerase \nand low dose ritonavir. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited reports of overdose with Agenerase. If overdose occurs, the patient should be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8) and standard supportive treatment provided as \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n14 \n\nnecessary.  Since amprenavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be helpful in reducing \nblood levels of amprenavir. \n \n \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group; protease inhibitor; ATC Code: J05A E05 \n \nMechanism of Action \n \nAmprenavir is a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 \nprotease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in \nthe formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. The in vitro antiviral activity observed with \nfosamprenavir is due to the presence of trace amounts of amprenavir. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and \nchronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 µM \nin acutely infected cells and was 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg/ml). The \nrelationship between in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication \nin humans has not been defined. \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro \n \nHIV-1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial \npassage experiments. Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had \ndeveloped I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. \n \nIn vivo \n \n\na) ART-naïve or PI-naïve patients \n \n\n(Note: Agenerase is not approved in ART-naive or PI-naive patients). \n \nVarious regimens have been assessed in the amprenavir/fosamprenavir development programs with \nand without co-administration of ritonavir. Analysis of the virological failure samples across these \nregimens defined four main resistance pathways: V32I+I47V, I50V, I54L/M and I84V.  Additional \nmutations observed which may contribute to resistance were: L10V/F/R, I13V, K20R/T, L33F/V, \nM36I, M46I/L, I47V/L Q58E, I62V, L63P, V77I, I85V, and I93L.   \n\n \nWhen ART naïve patients were treated with the currently approved doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir, \nas for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were infrequently observed. \nSixteen of 434 ART-naïve patients who received fosamprenavir 700mg/ritonavir 100mg twice daily in \nESS100732 experienced virological failure by Week 48 with 14 isolates genotyped. Three of 14 \nisolates had protease resistance mutations. One resistance mutation was observed in each of 3 isolates: \nK20K/R, I54I/L and I93I/L respectively.  \n \nGenotypic analysis of isolates from 13 of 14 paediatric patients exhibiting virological failure among \nthe 59 PI-naïve patients enrolled, demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n b) PI-experienced patients \n \nAmprenavir  \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced patients, PRO30017 (amprenavir 600 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice \ndaily in sub-study A and B with 80 and 37 patients respectively), the following mutations emerged in \npatients with virological failure: L10F/I/V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I/L, \nI47V, G48V, I50V, I54L/M/T/V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/I, I84V, I85V, L90M and \nI93L/M. \n \nFosamprenavir \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced patients, APV30003 and its extension, APV30005 (fosamprenavir 700 \nmg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in patients experiencing \nvirological failure through 96 weeks: L10F/I, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46I/L, I47V, I50V, \nI54L/M/S, A71I/T/V, G73S, V82A, I84V, and L90M.  \n \nIn the paediatric studies APV20003 and APV29005, 67 PI-experienced patients were treated with \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir and of 22 virological failure isolates genotyped, nine patients were found \nwith treatment-emergent protease mutations.  The mutational profiles were similar to those described \nfor PI-experienced adults treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir. \n \nAnalyses based on genotypic resistance testing. \nGenotypic interpretation systems may be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir in subjects with PI-resistant isolates. The current (July 2006) ANRS AC-11 \nalgorithm for fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations \nV32I+I47A/V, or I50V, or at least four mutations among: L10F/I/V, L33F, M36I, I54A/L/M/S/T/V, \nI62V, V82A/C/F/G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance). \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \nAnalyses based on phenotypic resistance testing. \nClinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems may be used in association with the genotypic \ndata to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with PI-\nresistant isolates.  Resistance testing diagnostic companies have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs \nfor FPV/RTV that can be used to interpret resistance test results. \n \nCross-Resistance \n \nHIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial \npassage experiments. Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had \ndeveloped I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. Each of these four genetic patterns \nassociated with reduced susceptibility to amprenavir produces some cross-resistance to ritonavir but \nsusceptibility to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir is generally retained. There are currently data on \ncross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fosamprenavir resistance \npathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations. Based on data from twenty-five \nantiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed \nBaseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir) the resistance pathways \nassociated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ritonavir (three of 25 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n16 \n\nisolates), darunavir/ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), \nlopinavir/ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ritonavir (four \nof 24 isolates).. Conversely amprenavir retains activity against some isolates with resistance to other \nPIs and this retained activity would depend on the number and type of protease resistance mutations \npresent in the isolates \n \nThe number of key PI-resistance mutations increases markedly the longer a failing PI-containing \nregimen is continued. Early discontinuation of failing therapies is recommended in order to limit the \naccumulation of multiple mutations, which may be detrimental to a subsequent rescue regimen. \n \nCross resistance between amprenavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely to occur because \nthe enzyme targets are different.  \n \nAgenerase is not recommended for use as monotherapy, due to the rapid emergence of resistant virus. \n \nClinical experience:  \n \nPI-experienced adults, boosted Agenerase capsules \n \nThe evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on \nstudy PRO30017, a randomized, open-label study, in which PI-experienced adults experiencing \nvirological failure (viral load ≥1000 copies/ml) received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) in \ncombination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard of \ncare (SOC) PI, predominantly boosted with low-dose RTV.  \n \nOne hundred and sixty-three (163) patients with virus sensitive to Agenerase, at least one other PI, and \nat least one NRTI were included in PRO30017 substudy A. The primary analysis assessed the non-\ninferiority of APV/r to the SOC PI group with respect to time-weighted average change from baseline \n(AAUCMB) in plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) at week 16 using a non-inferiority margin of 0.4 log10 \ncopies/ml. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n17 \n\n \nResults at week 16  \n \n Amprenavir / ritonavir \n\n (n = 80) \nSOC PI (n = 83): \n\nIndinavir / RTV (29%) \nLopinavir / RTV (36%) \nSaquinavir / RTV(20%) \n\nTreatment \ndifference \n\nBaseline \ncharacteristics \n\n  \n\nMedian HIV-1 RNA \n(log10 copies/ml) \n(range) \n\n4.11 (2.51–5.97) \n \n\n4.10 (2.34–6.07)  \n\nMedian CD4 (cells/ml) \n(range) \n \n\n265 (8–837) 322 (36–955)  \n\nPrior number of PIs \ntaken [n (%)] \n1 \n2 \n≥ 3 \n\n \n \n\n27 (34) \n18 (23)  \n35 (44)  \n\n \n \n\n25 (30) \n29 (35) \n29 (35) \n\n \n\nMedian number of PI \nprimary mutations 1 \n\n \n1.0 (range 0-2) \n\n \n1.0 (range 0-2) \n\n \n\nPrior number of NRTIs \ntaken [n (%)] \n≥ 4 \n\n \n49 (61) \n\n \n40 (48) \n\n \n\nOutcomes a   \nMean plasma HIV-1 \nRNA AAUCMB  \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n− 1.315 − 1.343 0.043b \n(−0.250, 0.335)c \n\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA \nbelow 400 copies/ml \n(%) \n\n66 70 6 \n(−21, 9)c \n\na  Intent To Treat (Exposed) Population: Observed analysis \nb  Mean stratified difference \nc 95% confidence interval \n1  Primary mutations were as defined by the IAS USA at the time of the original analysis, 2002 D30N, \nM46I/L, G48V, I50V, V82A/F/T/S, I84V, L90M. \n \nHeavily pre-treated children, unboosted Agenerase \n \nThe evidence of efficacy of unboosted Agenerase was based on two uncontrolled clinical studies \ninvolving 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, 152 of whom were PI experienced. \nThe studies evaluated Agenerase oral solution and capsules at doses of 15 mg/kg three times daily, 20 \nmg/kg three times daily, 20 mg/kg twice daily and 22.5 mg/kg twice daily although the majority \nreceived 20 mg/kg twice daily. Those of at least 13 years of age and weighing at least 50 kg received \n1200 mg Agenerase twice daily. Concomitant low dose ritonavir was not administered and the \nmajority of the PI experienced subjects had prior exposure to at least one (78 %) or two (42 %) of the \nNRTIs co-administered with Agenerase. At Week 48, approximately 25 % of those enrolled had \nplasma HIV-1 RNA < 10,000 copies/ml and 9 % < 400 copies/ml with a median change from baseline \nin CD4+ cells of 26 cells/mm3 (n=74).  \n \nBased on these data, careful consideration should be given to the expected benefit of unboosted \nAgenerase when optimising therapy for PI experienced children.  \n \nThere is no data on the efficacy of boosted Agenerase in children. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n18 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: after oral administration, amprenavir is rapidly and well absorbed. The absolute \nbioavailability is unknown due to the lack of an acceptable intravenous formulation for use in man. \nApproximately 90 % of an orally administered radiolabelled amprenavir dose was recovered in the \nurine and the faeces, primarily as amprenavir metabolites. Following oral administration, the mean \ntime (tmax) to maximal serum concentrations of amprenavir is between 1-2 hours for the capsule and \n0.5 to 1 hour for the oral solution. A second peak is observed after 10 to 12 hours and may represent \neither delayed absorption or enterohepatic recirculation.  \n \nAt therapeutic dosages (1200 mg twice daily), the mean maximum steady state concentration (Cmax,ss) \nof amprenavir capsules is 5.36 μg/ml (0.92-9.81) and the minimum steady state concentration (Cmin,ss) \nis 0.28 μg/ml (0.12-0.51). The mean AUC over a dosing interval of 12 hours is 18.46 μg.h/ml (3.02-\n32.95).  The 50 mg and 150 mg capsules have been shown to be bioequivalent. The bioavailability of \nthe oral solution at equivalent doses is lower than that of the capsules, with an AUC and Cmax \napproximately 14 % and 19 % lower, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \nThe AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the Cmax \ndecreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with amprenavir (600 mg \ntwice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of amprenavir. \n \nWhile administration of amprenavir with food results in a 25 % reduction in AUC, it had no effect on \nthe concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12). Therefore, although food affects the \nextent and rate of absorption, the steady-state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) was not affected by food \nintake. \n \nDistribution: the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 430 litres (6 l/kg assuming a 70 kg \nbody weight), suggesting a large volume of distribution, with penetration of amprenavir freely into \ntissues beyond the systemic circulation. The concentration of amprenavir in the cerebrospinal fluid is \nless than 1 % of plasma concentration. \n \nIn in vitro studies, the protein binding of amprenavir is approximately 90 %.  Amprenavir is primarily \nbound to the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), but also to albumin. Concentrations of AAG have been \nshown to decrease during the course of antiretroviral therapy. This change will decrease the total \nactive substance concentration in the plasma, however the amount of unbound amprenavir, which is \nthe active moiety, is likely to be unchanged. While absolute free active substance concentrations \nremain constant, the percent of free active substance will fluctuate directly with total active substance \nconcentrations at steady-state go from Cmax,ss to Cmin,ss over the course of the dosing interval. This will \nresult in a fluctuation in the apparent volume of distribution of total active substance, but the volume \nof distribution of free active substance does not change. \n \nClinically significant binding displacement interactions involving medicinal products primarily bound \nto AAG are generally not observed. Therefore, interactions with amprenavir due to protein binding \ndisplacement are highly unlikely. \n \nMetabolism: amprenavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with less than 3 % excreted unchanged \nin the urine. The primary route of metabolism is via the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme. \nAmprenavir is a substrate of and inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal products that are inducers, \ninhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be used with caution when administered concurrently with \nAgenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElimination: the plasma elimination half-life of amprenavir ranges from 7.1 to 10.6 hours. The plasma \namprenavir half-life is increased when Agenerase capsules are co-administered with ritonavir. \nFollowing multiple oral doses of amprenavir (1200 mg twice a day), there is no significant active \nsubstance accumulation. The primary route of elimination of amprenavir is via hepatic metabolism \nwith less than 3 % excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolites and unchanged amprenavir \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n19 \n\naccount for approximately 14 % of the administered amprenavir dose in the urine, and approximately \n75 % in the faeces.  \n \nSpecial populations: \n \nPaediatrics: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir in children (4 years of age and above) are similar to \nthose in adults. Dosages of 20 mg/kg twice a day and 15 mg/kg three times a day with Agenerase \ncapsules provided similar daily amprenavir exposure to 1200 mg twice a day in adults. Amprenavir is \n14 % less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules \nand Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis. \n \nElderly: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment: patients with renal impairment have not been specifically studied. Less than 3 % \nof the therapeutic dose of amprenavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. The impact of renal \nimpairment on amprenavir elimination should be minimal therefore, no initial dose adjustment is \nconsidered necessary. Renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible; therefore the impact of renal \nimpairment on amprenavir and ritonavir elimination should be minimal. \n \nHepatic impairment: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir are significantly altered in patients with \nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment. The AUC increased nearly three-fold in patients with \nmoderate impairment and four fold in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Clearance also \ndecreased in a corresponding manner to the AUC.  The dosage should therefore be reduced in these \npatients (see section 4.2). These dosing regimens will provide plasma amprenavir levels comparable to \nthose achieved in healthy subjects given a 1200 mg dose twice daily without concomitant \nadministration of ritonavir. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies with amprenavir in mice and rats, there were benign \nhepatocellular adenomas in males at exposure levels equivalent to 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rats) \nthose in humans given 1200 mg twice daily of amprenavir alone. In male mice altered hepatocellular \nfoci were seen at doses that were at least 2.0 times human therapeutic exposure. \n \nA higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was seen in all amprenavir male mouse treatment \ngroups. However, this increase was not statistically significantly different from male control mice by \nappropriate tests. The mechanism for the hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas found in these \nstudies has not been elucidated and the significance of the observed effects for humans is uncertain. \nHowever, there is little evidence from the exposure data in humans, both in clinical trials and from \nmarketed use, to suggest that these findings are of clinical significance. \n \nAmprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genetic toxicity assays, \nincluding bacterial reverse mutation (Ames Test), mouse lymphoma, rat micronucleus, and \nchromosome aberration in human peripheral lymphocytes. \n \nIn toxicological studies with mature animals, the clinically relevant findings were mostly confined to \nthe liver and gastrointestinal disturbances. Liver toxicity consisted of increases in liver enzymes, liver \nweights and microscopic findings including hepatocyte necrosis. This liver toxicity can be monitored \nfor and detected in clinical use, with measurements of AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.  \nHowever, significant liver toxicity has not been observed in patients treated in clinical studies, either \nduring administration of Agenerase or after discontinuation.  \n \nAmprenavir did not affect fertility.  \n \nLocal toxicity and sensitising potential was absent in animal studies, but slight irritating properties to \nthe rabbit eye were identified. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n20 \n\nToxicity studies in young animals, treated from four days of age, resulted in high mortality in both the \ncontrol animals and those receiving amprenavir. These results imply that young animals lack fully \ndeveloped metabolic pathways enabling them to excrete amprenavir or some critical components of \nthe formulation (e.g. propylene glycol, PEG 400). However, the possibility of anaphylactic reaction \nrelated to PEG 400 cannot be excluded. In clinical studies, the safety and efficacy of amprenavir have \nnot yet been established in children below four years of age. \n \nIn pregnant mice, rabbits and rats there were no major effects on embryo-foetal development.  \nHowever, at systemic plasma exposures significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rat) \nthan the expected human exposures during therapeutic dosing, a number of minor changes, including \nthymic elongation and minor skeletal variations were seen, indicating developmental delay.  A dose-\ndependent increase in placental weight was found in the rabbit and rat which may indicate effects on \nplacental function. It is therefore recommended that women of child-bearing potential taking \nAgenerase should practice effective contraception (e.g. barrier methods). \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSoft capsule. \n \nOblong, opaque, off-white to cream coloured, printed with ‘GX CC2’. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAgenerase, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of protease \ninhibitor (PI) experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 4 years. Agenerase \ncapsules should normally be administered with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of \namprenavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). The choice of amprenavir should be based on individual viral \nresistance testing and treatment history of patients (see section 5.1).  \nThe benefit of Agenerase boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated in PI naïve patients (see \nsection 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nThe importance of complying with the full recommended dosing regimen should be stressed to all \npatients. \n \nAgenerase is administered orally and can be taken with or without food. \n \nAgenerase is also available as an oral solution for use in children or adults unable to swallow capsules. \nAmprenavir is 14 % less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, \nAgenerase capsules and Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram \nbasis (see section 5.2). \n \nAdults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older (greater than 50 kg body weight): the \nrecommended dose of Agenerase capsules is 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nIf Agenerase capsules are used without the boosting effect of ritonavir higher doses of Agenerase \n(1200 mg twice daily) should be used. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n23 \n\nChildren (4 to 12 years) and patients less than 50 kg body weight: the recommended dose of \nAgenerase capsules is 20 mg/kg body weight twice a day, in combination with other antiretroviral \nagents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2400 mg (see section 5.1). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or \nother protease inhibitors have not yet been evaluated in children. Therefore, such combinations should \nbe avoided in children. \n \nChildren less than 4 years of age: Agenerase is not recommended in children below 4 years due to lack \nof data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly: the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amprenavir have not been studied in patients \nover 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment: no dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: the principal route of metabolism of amprenavir is via the liver. Agenerase \ncapsules should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Clinical efficacy and safety \nhave not been determined in this patient group. For subjects with hepatic impairment, pharmacokinetic \ndata are available for the use of Agenerase capsules without the boosting effect of ritonavir. Based on \npharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day for \nadult patients with moderate hepatic impairment and to 300 mg twice a day for adult patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. No dose recommendation can be made in children with hepatic impairment \n(see section 5.2). \n \nThe use of amprenavir in combination with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. No dose recommendations can be made regarding this combination. Concomitant \nadministration should be used with caution in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and \nis contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nAgenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Co-administration may result in \ncompetitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicinal products and create the potential for \nserious and/or life-threatening adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. amiodarone, bepridil, \nquinidine, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide), respiratory depression and /or prolonged \nsedation (e.g. oral triazolam and oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam,  \nsee section 4.5)) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia and ischaemia of other tissues, including \ncerebral or myocardial ischaemia (e.g. ergot derivatives). \n \nAgenerase in combination with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nCombination of rifampicin with Agenerase with concomitant low-dose ritonavir is contraindicated. \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAgenerase with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products with narrow \ntherapeutic windows that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, e.g. flecainide and \npropafenone (see section 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \namprenavir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of \namprenavir (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n24 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients should be advised that Agenerase, or any other current antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. \nCurrent antiretroviral therapies, including Agenerase, have not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. Appropriate precautions \nshould continue to be taken. \n \nOn the basis of current pharmacodynamic data, amprenavir should be used in combination with at \nleast two other antiretrovirals. When amprenavir is administered as monotherapy, resistant viruses \nrapidly emerge (see section 5.1). Agenerase capsules should normally be given in combination with \nlow dose ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral agents (see section 4.2). \n \nLiver Disease:  The safety and efficacy of amprenavir has not been established in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders. Agenerase capsules are contraindicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment when used in combination with ritonavir (see section4.3). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or \nC, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nMedicinal products – interactions \n \nConcomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the \nrisk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nThe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for \nmetabolism, thus concomitant use of Agenerase with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended \ndue to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Caution must also be exercised if \nAgenerase is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is metabolized to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.  \nIn this situation, a reduced dose of atorvastatin should be considered. If treatment with a HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin are recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nFor some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International \nNormalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential \nsafety problems with concomitant use. \n \nThe use of Agenerase concomitantly with halofantrine or lidocaine (systemic) is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) should be used with caution. Agenerase \nmay be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these \nmedicinal products concomitantly (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant medicinal products \n(cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin) when co-administered with Agenerase (see section 4.5). \n \nCaution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and \nvardenafil) (see section 4.5). \nCaution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with delavirdine (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n25 \n\n \nA reduction of rifabutin dosage of at least 50 % is recommended when administered with Agenerase. \nWhen ritonavir is co-administered further dose reduction may be necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nBecause of the potential for metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal \ncontraceptives may be modified, but there is insufficient information to predict the nature of the \ninteractions. Therefore, alternative reliable methods of contraception are recommended for women of \nchildbearing potential (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of amprenavir with methadone leads to a decrease of methadone concentrations. \nTherefore, when methadone is co-administered with amprenavir, patients should be monitored for \nopiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose ritonavir is also given. No recommendations can \ncurrently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose when amprenavir is co-administered with \nmethadone. \n \nAgenerase capsules contain vitamin E (109 IU/150 mg capsule), therefore additional vitamin E \nsupplementation is not recommended. \n \nAgenerase capsules also contain sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n \nDue to the potential risk of toxicity from the high propylene glycol content of Agenerase oral solution, \nthis formulation is contraindicated in children below the age of four years and should be used with \ncaution in certain other patient populations. The Summary of Product Characteristics of Agenerase \noral solution should be consulted for full prescribing information. \n \nRash / cutaneous reactions \n \nMost patients with mild or moderate rash can continue Agenerase. Appropriate antihistamines (e.g. \ncetirizine dihydrochloride) may reduce pruritus and hasten the resolution of rash. Agenerase should be \npermanently discontinued when rash is accompanied with systemic symptoms or allergic symptoms or \nmucosal involvement (see section 4.8). \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nNew onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbations of existing diabetes mellitus have \nbeen reported in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors. In some of \nthese, the hyperglycaemia was severe and in some cases also associated with ketoacidosis. Many of \nthe patients had confounding medical conditions, some of which required therapy with agents that \nhave been associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.  \n \nLipodystrophy \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat \n(lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. \nKnowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis and \nprotease inhibitors and lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been \nhypothesised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older \nage, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated \nmetabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat \nredistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood \nglucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8). \n \nHaemophiliac patients \n \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n26 \n\npatients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued, or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.  \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have been performed with amprenavir as the sole protease inhibitor. When \namprenavir and ritonavir are co-administered, the ritonavir metabolic drug interaction profile may \npredominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 \nand induces CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and glucuronosyl transferase. The full prescribing \ninformation for ritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Agenerase and \nritonavir. \n \nAmprenavir and ritonavir are primarily metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal \nproducts that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may modify the \npharmacokinetics of amprenavir. Similarly, amprenavir and ritonavir might also modify the \npharmacokinetics of other medicinal products that share this metabolic pathway. \n \nAssociations contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nCYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index \nAgenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows containing active substances that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). \nCo-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these active substances \nthus increasing their plasma level and leading to serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions \nsuch as cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, \nterfenadine) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) (see section \n4.3). \n \nCYP2D6 substrates with narrow therapeutic index \nAgenerase with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products containing active \nsubstances that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism and for which elevated plasma \nconcentrations are associated with serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions. These active \nsubstances include flecainide and propafenone (see section 4.3). \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n27 \n\nRifampicin \nRifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause an 82% decrease in amprenavir \nAUC, which can result in virological failure and resistance development. During attempts to overcome \nthe decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high \nfrequency of liver reactions was seen. The combination of rifampicin and Agenerase with concomitant \nlow-dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \nSerum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by concomitant use of the herbal preparation St John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum). This is due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes by St John’s \nwort. Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort should therefore not be combined with Agenerase. \nIf a patient is already taking St John’s wort, check amprenavir and if possible viral levels and stop St \nJohn’s wort. Amprenavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s wort. The dose of amprenavir may \nneed adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St \nJohn’s wort (see section 4.3). \n \n• Other combinations \n \nOf note, the following interaction data was obtained in adults. \n \nAntiretroviral agents \n \n• Protease inhibitors (PIs): \n \nIndinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of indinavir were decreased by 38 %, 27 %, and 22 %, respectively, \nwhen given with amprenavir.  The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. The AUC, Cmin and \nCmax of amprenavir were increased by 33 %, 25 %, and 18 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is \nnecessary for either medicinal product when indinavir is administered in combination with \namprenavir. \n \nSaquinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of saquinavir were decreased by 19 % and 48 % and increased by \n21 %, respectively, when given with amprenavir.  The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. \nThe AUC, Cmin and Cmax of amprenavir were decreased by 32 %, 14 %, and 37 %, respectively. No \ndose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when saquinavir is administered in \ncombination with amprenavir. \n \nNelfinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of nelfinavir were increased by 15 %, 14 %, and 12 %, \nrespectively, when given with amprenavir. The Cmax of amprenavir was decreased by 14 % whilst the \nAUC and Cmin were increased by 9 % and 189 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is necessary for \neither medicinal product when nelfinavir is administered in combination with amprenavir (see also \nefavirenz below). \n \nRitonavir: the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the \nCmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with amprenavir \ncapsules (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of \namprenavir capsules. In clinical trials, doses of amprenavir 600 mg twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily have been used; confirming the safety and efficacy of this regimen.  \n \nLopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra): in an open-label, non-fasting pharmacokinetic study, the AUC, Cmax \nand Cmin of lopinavir were decreased by 38%, 28% and 52% respectively when amprenavir (750 mg \ntwice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily). \nIn the same study, the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of amprenavir were increased 72%, 12%, and 483%, \nrespectively, when compared to values after standard doses of amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily). \n \nThe amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) \nin combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40-\n50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n28 \n\ntwice daily. Adding additional ritonavir to an amprenavir plus Kaletra regimen increase lopinavir Cmin \nvalues, but not amprenavir Cmin values. No dose recommendation can be given for the co-\nadministration of amprenavir and Kaletra, but close monitoring is advised because the safety and \nefficacy of this combination is unknown. \n \n• Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs):  \n \nZidovudine: the AUC and Cmax of zidovudine were increased by 31 % and 40 %, respectively, when \ngiven with amprenavir. The AUC and the Cmax of amprenavir were unaltered. No dose adjustment for \neither medicinal product is necessary when zidovudine is administered in combination with \namprenavir. \n \nLamivudine: the AUC and Cmax of lamivudine and amprenavir, respectively, were both unaltered  \nwhen these two medicinal products were given concomitantly. No dose adjustment is necessary for \neither medicinal product when lamivudine is administered in combination with amprenavir. \n \nAbacavir: the AUC, Cmin, and Cmax of abacavir were unaltered when given with amprenavir. The AUC, \nCmin, and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 29 %, 27 %, and 47 %, respectively. No dose \nadjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when abacavir is administered in combination \nwith amprenavir. \n \nDidanosine: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with \ndidanosine, however, due to its antacid component, it is recommended that didanosine and Agenerase \nshould be administered at least one hour apart (see Antacids below). \n \n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): \n \nEfavirenz: efavirenz has been seen to decrease the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin,ss of amprenavir by \napproximately 40 % in adults. When amprenavir is combined with ritonavir, the effect of efavirenz is \ncompensated by the pharmacokinetic booster effect of ritonavir. Therefore, if efavirenz is given in \ncombination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose \nadjustment is necessary. \n \nFurther, if efavirenz is given in combination with amprenavir and nelfinavir, no dosage adjustment is \nnecessary for any of the medicinal products.  \n \nTreatment with efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the \nexposure to both protease inhibitors would be decreased. \n \nNo dose recommendation can be given for co-administration of amprenavir with another protease \ninhibitor and efavirenz in children. Such combinations should be avoided in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nNevirapine : The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and the limited evidence available \nsuggest that nevirapine may decrease the serum concentrations of amprenavir. \n \nDelavirdine: the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of delavirdine were decreased by 61%, 47% and 88% \nrespectively when given with amprenavir. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by \n130%, 40% and 125% respectively.  \n \nNo dose recommendations can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir and delavirdine. If \nthese medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, as delavirdine may be less effective \ndue to decreased and potentially sub-therapeutic plasma concentrations. \n \nNo dose recommendations can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir and low dose \nritonavir with delavirdine. If these medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, and \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n29 \n\nclose clinical and virological monitoring should be performed since it is difficult to predict the effect \nof the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirdine. \n \nAntibiotics/antifungals \n \nRifabutin: co-administration of amprenavir with rifabutin resulted in a 193 % increase in rifabutin \nAUC and an increase of rifabutin-related adverse events. The increase in rifabutin plasma \nconcentration is likely to result from inhibition of rifabutin CYP3A4 mediated metabolism by \namprenavir. When it is clinically necessary to co-administer rifabutin with Agenerase, a dosage \nreduction of at least half the recommended dose of rifabutin is advised, although no clinical data are \navailable. When ritonavir is co-administered a larger increase in rifabutin concentration may occur. \n \nClarithromycin: the AUC and Cmin of clarithromycin were unaltered and the Cmax decreased by 10 % \nwhen given with amprenavir. The AUC, Cmin and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 18 %, 39 %, \nand 15 % respectively. No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when \nclarithromycin is administered in combination with amprenavir. When ritonavir is co-administered an \nincrease in clarithromycin concentrations may occur. \n \nErythromycin: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with \nerythromycin, however, plasma levels of both medicinal products may be increased when  \nco-administered. \n \nKetoconazole / Itraconazole: the AUC and Cmax of ketoconazole were increased by 44 % and 19 % \nrespectively when given with amprenavir alone. The AUC and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by \n31 % and decreased by 16 %, respectively. Itraconazole concentrations are expected to increase in the \nsame manner as ketoconazole. No dose adjustment for any of the medicinal products is necessary \nwhen either ketoconazole is or itraconazole administered in combination with amprenavir. Co-\nadministration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 200 mg \nonce daily increased plasma ketoconazole Cmax by 25 % and increased AUC(0-τ) to values 2.69-fold \nthose observed on administration of ketoconazole 200 mg once daily without concurrent \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir.  The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were unchanged. When used \nwith Agenerase with ritonavir, high doses (>200 mg/day) of ketoconazole or itraconazole are not \nrecommended. \n \nOther possible interactions \n \nOther medicinal products, listed below, including examples of substrates, inhibitors or inducers of \nCYP3A4, may lead to interactions when administered with Agenerase. The clinical significance of \nthese possible interactions is not known and has not been investigated. Patients should therefore be \nmonitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicinal products when these are administered in \ncombination with Agenerase. \n \nAntacids: on the basis of the data for other protease inhibitors, it is advisable not to take antacids at the \nsame time as Agenerase, since its absorption may be impaired. It is recommended that antacids and \nAgenerase should be administered at least one hour apart. \n \nAnticonvulsant active substances: concomitant administration of anticonvulsant active substances \nknown as enzymatic inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) with amprenavir may lead \nto a decrease in the plasma concentrations of amprenavir. These combinations should be used with \ncaution and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nCalcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium \nchannel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, \nnimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these \nmedicinal products. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n30 \n\nErectile dysfunction agents: based on data for other protease inhibitors caution should be used when \nprescribing PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and vardenafil) to patients receiving Agenerase. Co-\nadministration with Agenerase may substantially increase PDE5 inhibitor plasma concentrations and \nassociated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.4). \n \nFluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg \ncapsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 \ndays in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the \nintrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86 % (90 % confidence interval 82-89 %). Greater \neffects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects \nincluding Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving \nritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with \nother corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide. Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of Agenerase with ritonavir and these glucocorticoids is not recommended \nunless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see \nsection 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of \nlocal and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may \nhave to be performed over a longer period. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on \nritonavir plasma levels is yet unknown. \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on \nCYP3A4 for metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased \nplasma concentrations when co-administered with Agenerase. Since increased concentrations of \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of \nthese medicinal products with Agenerase is not recommended. Atorvastatin is less dependent on \nCYP3A4 for metabolism. When used with Agenerase, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should \nbe administered. The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A4, and \ninteractions are not expected with protease inhibitors. If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended. \n \nImmunosuppressants: frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring of immunosuppresant levels is \nrecommended until levels have stabilised as plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and \ntacrolimus may be increased when co-administered with amprenavir (see section 4.4). \n \nMidazolam: midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration with Agenerase \nwith or without ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No \ndrug interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of Agenerase with \nbenzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are \nexpected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore Agenerase should not \nbe co-administered with orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be \nused with co-administration of Agenerase and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of \nparenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam \nplasma levels. If Agenerase with or without ritonavir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical \nmonitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged \nsedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single \ndose of midazolam is administered. \n \nMethadone and opiate derivatives: co-administration of methadone with amprenavir resulted in a \ndecrease in the Cmax and AUC of the active methadone enantiomer (R-enantiomer) of 25% and 13% \nrespectively, whilst the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the inactive methadone enantiomer (S-enantiomer) \nwere decreased by 48%, 40% and 23% respectively. When methadone is co-administered with \namprenavir, patients should be monitored for opiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose \nritonavir is also given. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n31 \n\nAs compared to a non-matched historical control group, co-administration of methadone and \namprenavir resulted in a 30%, 27% and 25% decrease in serum amprenavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin \nrespectively. No recommendations can currently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose \nwhen amprenavir is co-administered with methadone due to the inherent low reliability of non-\nmatched historical controls.  \n \nOral anticoagulants: a reinforced monitoring of the International Normalised Ratio is recommended in \ncase of administration of Agenerase with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to a possible \ndecrease or increase of their antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4). \n \nSteroids: oestrogens and progestogens may interact with amprenavir. However, the information \ncurrently available is not sufficient for determining the nature of the interaction. Co-administration of \n0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg norethindrone resulted in a decrease of the amprenavir AUC \nand Cmin of 22% and 20% respectively, Cmax being unchanged. The Cmin of ethinyl estradiol was \nincreased by 32%, whilst the AUC and Cmin of norethindrone were increased by 18% and 45% \nrespectively. Alternative methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing \npotential. When ritonavir is co-administered, the effect on hormonal contraceptive concentrations \ncannot be predicted, therefore, alternative methods of contraception are also recommended. \n \nTricyclic antidepressants: careful monitoring of the therapeutic and adverse reactions of tricyclic \nantidepressants is recommended when they (for example desipramine and nortriptyline) are \nconcomitantly administered with Agenerase (see section 4.4). \n \nParoxetine: plasma concentrations of paroxetine may be significantly decreased when co-administered \nwith amprenavir and ritonavir. The mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. Based on \nhistorical comparison, amprenavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by paroxetine. \nTherefore, if paroxetine is co-administered with Agenerase and ritonavir, the recommended approach \nis a dose titration of paroxetine based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response. In addition, \npatients on stable dose of paroxetine who start treatment with Agenerase and ritonavir should be \nmonitored for antidepressant response. \n \nOther substances: plasma concentrations of other substances may be increased by amprenavir. These \ninclude substances such as: clozapine, cimetidine, dapsone and loratadine. \nSome substances (e.g. lidocaine (by systemic route) and halofantrine) given with Agenerase may \ncause serious adverse reactions. Concomitant use is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: there are no adequate data from the use of amprenavir in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nThis medicinal product should be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential \nbenefits compared to the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nLactation: amprenavir-related material was found in rat milk, but it is not known whether amprenavir \nis excreted in human milk. A reproduction study in pregnant rats dosed from the time of uterine \nimplantation through lactation showed reduced body weight gains in the offspring during the nursing \nperiod. The systemic exposure to the dams associated with this finding was similar to exposure in \nhumans, following administration of the recommended dose. The subsequent development of the \noffspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by the maternal \nadministration of amprenavir. \n \nIt is therefore recommended that mothers being treated with Agenerase do not breast-feed their \ninfants. Additionally, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in \norder to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n32 \n\n \nNo studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children of at least 4 years of age, in controlled \nclinical trials, in combination with various other antiretroviral agents. Adverse events considered \nassociated with the use of Agenerase are gastro-intestinal symptoms, rash and oral/peri-oral \nparaesthesia. Most undesirable effects associated with Agenerase therapy were mild to moderate in \nseverity, early in onset, and rarely treatment-limiting. For many of these events, it is unclear whether \nthey are related to Agenerase, to concomitant treatment used in the management of HIV disease or to \nthe disease process.  \n \nIn children, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. The \nfrequency categories used are: \n \nVery common  ≥ 1 in 10 \nCommon  ≥ 1 in 100 and < 1 in 10 \nUncommon  ≥ 1 in 1,000 and < 1 in 100 \nRare   ≥1 in 10,000 and < 1 in 1,000 \n \nFrequency categories for the events below have been based on clinical trials and postmarketing data.  \n \nMost of the adverse events below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) \ninvolving PI naïve subjects receiving Agenerase 1200mg twice daily. Events (grade 2-4) reported by \nstudy investigators as attributable to study medication and occurring in >1% of patients, are included \nas well as grade 3-4 treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities. Note that the background rates in \ncomparator groups were not taken into account. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nCommon: Elevated triglycerides, elevated amylase, abnormal fat redistribution, anorexia \nUncommon:  Hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolaemia \n \nElevated triglycerides, elevated amylase and hyperglycaemia (grade 3-4) were reported primarily in \npatients with abnormal values at baseline. \n \nElevations in cholesterol were of grade 3-4 intensity. \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) \nin HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal \nand visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump). \n \nSymptoms of abnormal fat redistribution were infrequent in PROAB3001 with amprenavir. Only one \ncase (a buffalo hump) was reported in 113 (< 1 %) antiretroviral naive subjects treated with \namprenavir in combination with lamivudine/zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks. In study \nPROAB3006, seven cases (3 %) were reported in 245 NRTI-experienced subjects treated with \namprenavir and in 27 (11 %) of 241 subjects treated with indinavir, in combination with various \nNRTIs for a median duration of 56 weeks (p< 0.001). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as \nhypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and \nhyperlactataemia (see section 4.4). \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n33 \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n \nCommon:  Mood disorders, depressive disorders \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nVery Common:  Headache \nCommon:  Oral/perioral paraesthesia, tremors, sleep disorders \n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n \nVery Common:  Diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, dyspeptic symptoms, loose stools \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nCommon:  Elevated transaminases \nUncommon:  Hyperbilirubinaemia \n \nElevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinaemia (grade 3-4) were reported primarily in patients with \nabnormal values at baseline. Almost all subjects with abnormal liver function tests were co-infected \nwith Hepatitis B or C virus. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n \nVery Common:   Rash \nUncommon:  Angioedema \nRare:   Stevens Johnson syndrome \n \nRashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapular cutaneous eruptions, with or \nwithout pruritus, occurring during the second week of therapy and resolving spontaneously within two \nweeks, without discontinuation of treatment with amprenavir. A higher incidence of rash was reported \nin patients treated with amprenavir in combination with efavirenz. Severe or life-threatening skin \nreactions have also occurred in patients treated with amprenavir (see section 4.4). \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis, and rarely rhabdomyolysis have been reported with protease \ninhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues. \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery Common:  Fatigue \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise (see section 4.4). \n \nIn PI experienced patients receiving Agenerase capsules 600 mg twice daily and low dose ritonavir, \n100 mg twice daily, the nature and frequency of adverse events (grade 2-4) and Grade 3/4 laboratory \nabnormalities were similar to those observed with Agenerase alone, with the exception of elevated \ntriglyceride levels, and elevated CPK levels which were very common in patients receiving Agenerase \nand low dose ritonavir. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n34 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited reports of overdose with Agenerase.

Since amprenavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be helpful in reducing \nblood levels of amprenavir. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group; protease inhibitor; ATC Code: J05A E05 \n \nMechanism of Action \n \nAmprenavir is a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 \nprotease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in \nthe formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. The in vitro antiviral activity observed with \nfosamprenavir is due to the presence of trace amounts of amprenavir. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and \nchronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 µM \nin acutely infected cells and was 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg/ml). The \nrelationship between in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication \nin humans has not been defined. \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro \n \nHIV-1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial \npassage experiments Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had \ndeveloped I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. \n \nIn vivo \n \n\na) ART-naïve or PI-naïve patients \n \n\n(Note: Agenerase is not approved in ART-naive or PI-naive patients). \n \nVarious regimens have been assessed in the amprenavir/fosamprenavir development programs with \nand without co-administration of ritonavir. Analysis of the virological failure samples across these \nregimens defined four main resistance pathways: V32I+I47V, I50V, I54L/M and I84V. Additional \nmutations observed which may contribute to resistance were: L10V/F/R, I13V, K20R/T, L33F/V, \nM36I, M46I/L, I47V/L Q58E, I62V, L63P, V77I, I85V, and I93L.   \n\n   \nWhen ART naïve patients were treated with the currently approved doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir, \nas for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were infrequently observed. \nSixteen of 434 ART-naïve patients who received fosamprenavir 700mg/ritonavir 100mg twice daily in \nESS100732 experienced virological failure by Week 48 with 14 isolates genotyped. Three of 14 \nisolates had protease resistance mutations. One resistance mutation was observed in each of 3 isolates: \nK20K/R, I54I/L and I93I/L respectively.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n35 \n\n \nGenotypic analysis of isolates from 13 of 14 paediatric patients exhibiting virological failure among \nthe 59 PI-naïve patients enrolled, demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults. \n \n b) PI-experienced patients \n \nAmprenavir  \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced patients, PRO30017 (amprenavir 600 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice \ndaily in sub-study A and B with 80 and 37 patients respectively), the following mutations emerged in \npatients with virological failure: L10F/I/V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I/L, \nI47V, G48V, I50V, I54L/M/T/V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/I, I84V, I85V, L90M and \nI93L/M. \n \nFosamprenavir \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced patients, APV30003 and its extension, APV30005 (fosamprenavir 700 \nmg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in patients experiencing \nvirological failure through 96 weeks: L10F/I, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46I/L, I47V, I50V, \nI54L/M/S, A71I/T/V, G73S, V82A, I84V, and L90M.  \n \nIn the paediatric studies APV20003 and APV29005, 67 PI-experienced patients were treated with \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir and of 22 virological failure isolates genotyped, nine patients were found \nwith treatment-emergent protease mutations.  The mutational profiles were similar to those described \nfor PI-experienced adults treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir. \n \nAnalyses based on genotypic resistance testing. \nGenotypic interpretation systems may be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir in subjects with PI-resistant isolates. The current (July 2006) ANRS AC-11 \nalgorithm for fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations \nV32I+I47A/V, or I50V, or at least four mutations among: L10F/I/V, L33F, M36I, I54A/L/M/S/T/V, \nI62V, V82A/C/F/G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance). \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \nAnalyses based on phenotypic resistance testing. \nClinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems may be used in association with the genotypic \ndata to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with PI-\nresistant isolates.  Resistance testing diagnostic companies have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs \nfor FPV/RTV that can be used to interpret resistance test results. \n \nCross-Resistance \n \nHIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial \npassage experiments. Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had \ndeveloped I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. Each of these four genetic patterns \nassociated with reduced susceptibility to amprenavir produces some cross-resistance to ritonavir but \nsusceptibility to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir is generally retained. There are currently data on \ncross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fosamprenavir resistance \npathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations. Based on data from twenty-five \nantiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed \nBaseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir) the resistance pathways \nassociated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ritonavir (three of 25 \nisolates), darunavir/ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), \nlopinavir/ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ritonavir (four \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n36 \n\nof 24 isolates).. Conversely amprenavir retains activity against some isolates with resistance to other \nPIs and this retained activity would depend on the number and type of protease resistance mutations \npresent in the isolates. \n \nThe number of key PI-resistance mutations increases markedly the longer a failing PI-containing \nregimen is continued. Early discontinuation of failing therapies is recommended in order to limit the \naccumulation of multiple mutations, which may be detrimental to a subsequent rescue regimen. \n \nCross resistance between amprenavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, is unlikely to occur because \nthe enzyme targets are different.  \n \nAgenerase is not recommended for use as monotherapy, due to the rapid emergence of resistant virus. \n \nClinical experience:  \n \nPI-experienced adults, boosted Agenerase capsules \n \nThe evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on \nstudy PRO30017, a randomized, open-label study, in which PI-experienced adults experiencing \nvirological failure (viral load ≥1000 copies/ml) received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) in \ncombination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard of \ncare (SOC) PI, predominantly boosted with low-dose RTV.  \n \nOne hundred and sixty-three (163) patients with virus sensitive to Agenerase, at least one other PI, and \nat least one NRTI were included in PRO30017 substudy A. The primary analysis assessed the non-\ninferiority of APV/r to the SOC PI group with respect to time-weighted average change from baseline \n(AAUCMB) in plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) at week 16 using a non-inferiority margin of 0.4 log10 \ncopies/ml. \n \nResults at week 16  \n \n Amprenavir / ritonavir \n\n (n = 80) \nSOC PI (n = 83): \n\nIndinavir / RTV (29%) \nLopinavir / RTV (36%) \nSaquinavir / RTV(20%) \n\nTreatment \ndifference \n\nBaseline \ncharacteristics \n\n  \n\nMedian HIV-1 RNA \n(log10 copies/ml) \n(range) \n\n4.11 (2.51–5.97) \n \n\n4.10 (2.34–6.07)  \n\nMedian CD4 (cells/ml) \n(range) \n \n\n265 (8–837) 322 (36–955)  \n\nPrior number of PIs \ntaken [n (%)] \n1 \n2 \n≥ 3 \n\n \n \n\n27 (34) \n18 (23)  \n35 (44)  \n\n \n \n\n25 (30) \n29 (35) \n29 (35) \n\n \n\nMedian number of PI \nprimary mutations 1 \n\n \n1.0 (range 0-2) \n\n \n1.0 (range 0-2) \n\n \n\nPrior number of NRTIs \ntaken [n (%)] \n≥ 4 \n\n \n49 (61) \n\n \n40 (48) \n\n \n\nOutcomes a   \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n37 \n\nMean plasma HIV-1 \nRNA AAUCMB  \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n− 1.315 − 1.343 0.043b \n(−0.250, 0.335)c \n\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA \nbelow 400 copies/ml \n(%) \n\n66 70 6 \n(−21, 9)c \n\na  Intent To Treat (Exposed) Population: Observed analysis \nb  Mean stratified difference \nc 95% confidence interval \n1  Primary mutations were as defined by the IAS USA at the time of the original analysis, 2002 D30N, \nM46I/L, G48V, I50V, V82A/F/T/S, I84V, L90M. \n \n\nHeavily pre-treated children, unboosted Agenerase \n \nThe evidence of efficacy of unboosted Agenerase was based on two uncontrolled clinical studies \ninvolving 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, 152 of whom were PI experienced. \nThe studies evaluated Agenerase oral solution and capsules at doses of 15 mg/kg three times daily, 20 \nmg/kg three times daily, 20 mg/kg twice daily and 22.5 mg/kg twice daily although the majority \nreceived 20 mg/kg twice daily. Those of at least 13 years of age and weighing at least 50 kg received \n1200 mg Agenerase twice daily. Concomitant low dose ritonavir was not administered and the \nmajority of the PI experienced subjects had prior exposure to at least one (78 %) or two (42 %) of the \nNRTIs co-administered with Agenerase. At Week 48, approximately 25 % of those enrolled had \nplasma HIV-1 RNA < 10,000 copies/ml and 9 % < 400 copies/ml with a median change from baseline \nin CD4+ cells of 26 cells/mm3 (n=74).  \n \nBased on these data, careful consideration should be given to the expected benefit of unboosted \nAgenerase when optimising therapy for PI experienced children.  \n \nThere is no data on the efficacy of boosted Agenerase in children. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: after oral administration, amprenavir is rapidly and well absorbed. The absolute \nbioavailability is unknown due to the lack of an acceptable intravenous formulation for use in man. \nApproximately 90 % of an orally administered radiolabelled amprenavir dose was recovered in the \nurine and the faeces, primarily as amprenavir metabolites. Following oral administration, the mean \ntime (tmax) to maximal serum concentrations of amprenavir is between 1-2 hours for the capsule and \n0.5 to 1 hour for the oral solution. A second peak is observed after 10 to 12 hours and may represent \neither delayed absorption or enterohepatic recirculation. \n \nAt therapeutic dosages (1200 mg twice daily), the mean maximum steady state concentration (Cmax,ss) \nof amprenavir capsules is 5.36 μg/ml (0.92-9.81) and the minimum steady state concentration (Cmin,ss) \nis 0.28 μg/ml (0.12-0.51). The mean AUC over a dosing interval of 12 hours is 18.46 μg.h/ml (3.02-\n32.95). The 50 mg and 150 mg capsules have been shown to be bioequivalent. The bioavailability of \nthe oral solution at equivalent doses is lower than that of the capsules, with an AUC and Cmax \napproximately 14 % and 19 % lower, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \nThe AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the Cmax \ndecreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with amprenavir (600 mg \ntwice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of amprenavir. \n \nWhile administration of amprenavir with food results in a 25 % reduction in AUC, it had no effect on \nthe concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12). Therefore, although food affects the \nextent and rate of absorption, the steady-state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) was not affected by food \nintake. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n38 \n\nDistribution: the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 430 litres (6 l/kg assuming a 70 kg \nbody weight), suggesting a large volume of distribution, with penetration of amprenavir freely into \ntissues beyond the systemic circulation. The concentration of amprenavir in the cerebrospinal fluid is \nless than 1 % of plasma concentration. \n \nIn in vitro studies, the protein binding of amprenavir is approximately 90 %. Amprenavir is primarily \nbound to the alpha–1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), but also to albumin. Concentrations of AAG have \nbeen shown to decrease during the course of antiretroviral therapy. This change will decrease the total  \nactive substance concentration in the plasma, however the amount of unbound amprenavir, which is \nthe active moiety, is likely to be unchanged. While absolute free active substance concentrations \nremain constant, the percent of free active substance will fluctuate directly with total active substance \nconcentrations at steady-state go from Cmax,ss to Cmin,ss over the course of the dosing interval.  This will \nresult in a fluctuation in the apparent volume of distribution of total active substance but the volume of \ndistribution of free active substance does not change. \n \nClinically significant binding displacement interactions involving medicinal products primarily bound \nto AAG are generally not observed. Therefore, interactions with amprenavir due to protein binding \ndisplacement are highly unlikely. \n \nMetabolism: amprenavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with less than 3 % excreted unchanged \nin the urine. The primary route of metabolism is via the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme. \nAmprenavir is a substrate of and inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore medicinal products that are inducers, \ninhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be used with caution when administered concurrently with \nAgenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElimination: the plasma elimination half-life of amprenavir ranges from 7.1 to 10.6 hours. The plasma \namprenavir half-life is increased when Agenerase capsules are co-administered with ritonavir. \nFollowing multiple oral doses of amprenavir (1200 mg twice a day), there is no significant active \nsubstance accumulation. The primary route of elimination of amprenavir is via hepatic metabolism \nwith less than 3 % excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolites and unchanged amprenavir \naccount for approximately 14 % of the administered amprenavir dose in the urine, and approximately \n75 % in the faeces.  \n \nSpecial populations: \n \nPaediatrics: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir in children (4 years of age and above) are similar to \nthose in adults. Dosages of 20 mg/kg twice a day and 15 mg/kg three times a day with Agenerase \ncapsules provided similar daily amprenavir exposure to 1200 mg twice a day in adults. Amprenavir is \n14 % less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules \nand Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis. \n \nElderly: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment: patients with renal impairment have not been specifically studied. Less than 3 % \nof the therapeutic dose of amprenavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. The impact of renal \nimpairment on amprenavir elimination should be minimal therefore, no initial dose adjustment is \nconsidered necessary. Renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible; therefore the impact of renal \nimpairment on amprenavir and ritonavir elimination should be minimal. \n \nHepatic impairment: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir are significantly altered in patients with \nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment. The AUC increased nearly three fold in patients with \nmoderate impairment and four fold in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Clearance also \ndecreased in a corresponding manner to the AUC. The dosage should therefore be reduced in these \npatients (see section 4.2). These dosing regimens will provide plasma amprenavir levels comparable to \nthose achieved in healthy subjects given a 1200 mg dose twice daily without concomitant \nadministration of ritonavir. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n39 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies with amprenavir in mice and rats, there were benign \nhepatocellular adenomas in males at exposure levels equivalent to 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rats) \nthose in humans given 1200 mg twice daily of amprenavir alone. In male mice altered hepatocellular \nfoci were seen at doses that were at least 2.0 times human therapeutic exposure. \n \nA higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was seen in all amprenavir male mouse treatment \ngroups. However, this increase was not statistically significantly different from male control mice by \nappropriate tests. The mechanism for the hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas found in these \nstudies has not been elucidated and the significance of the observed effects for humans is uncertain. \nHowever, there is little evidence from the exposure data in humans, both in clinical trials and from \nmarketed use, to suggest that these findings are of clinical significance. \n \nAmprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genetic toxicity assays, \nincluding bacterial reverse mutation (Ames Test), mouse lymphoma, rat micronucleus, and \nchromosome aberration in human peripheral lymphocytes. \n \nIn toxicological studies with mature animals, the clinically relevant findings were mostly confined to \nthe liver and gastrointestinal disturbances.  Liver toxicity consisted of increases in liver enzymes, liver \nweights and microscopic findings including hepatocyte necrosis.  This liver toxicity can be monitored \nfor and detected in clinical use, with measurements of AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity. \nHowever, significant liver toxicity has not been observed in patients treated in clinical studies, either \nduring administration of Agenerase or after discontinuation.  \n \nAmprenavir did not affect fertility. Local toxicity and sensitising potential was absent in animal \nstudies, but slight irritating properties to the rabbit eye were identified. \n \nToxicity studies in young animals, treated from four days of age, resulted in high mortality in both the \ncontrol animals and those receiving amprenavir.  These results imply that young animals lack fully \ndeveloped metabolic pathways enabling them to excrete amprenavir or some critical components of \nthe formulation (e.g. propylene glycol, PEG400). However, the possibility of anaphylactic reaction \nrelated to PEG400 cannot be excluded. In clinical studies, the safety and efficacy of amprenavir have \nnot yet been established in children below four years of age.  \n \nIn pregnant mice, rabbits and rats there were no major effects on embryo-foetal development.  \nHowever, at systemic plasma exposures significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rat) \nthan the expected human exposures during therapeutic dosing, a number of minor changes, including \nthymic elongation and minor skeletal variations were seen, indicating developmental delay.  A dose-\ndependent increase in placental weight was found in the rabbit and rat which may indicate effects on \nplacental function. It is therefore recommended that women of child-bearing potential taking \nAgenerase should practice effective contraception (e.g. barrier methods). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAgenerase 15 mg/ml oral solution. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAgenerase oral solution contains 15 mg/ml of amprenavir.  \n \nExcipients: \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution. \n \nThe oral solution is clear, pale yellow to yellow with grape, bubblegum and peppermint flavouring. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAgenerase oral solution, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment \nof protease inhibitor (PI) experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 4 years. The \nchoice of amprenavir should be based on individual viral resistance testing and treatment history of \npatients (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit of Agenerase oral solution boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated either in PI \nnaïve patients or in PI experienced patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nThe importance of complying with the full recommended dosing regimen should be stressed to all \npatients. \n \nAgenerase oral solution is administered orally and can be taken with or without food. \n \nAgenerase is also available as capsules. Amprenavir is 14 % less bioavailable from the Agenerase oral \nsolution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules and Agenerase oral solution are not \ninterchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients should discontinue Agenerase oral solution as soon as they are able to swallow the capsule \nformulation (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients of 4 years and older unable to swallow Agenerase capsules: the recommended dose of \nAgenerase oral solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml)/kg three times a day, in combination with other \nantiretroviral agents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2800 mg (see section 5.1). \n \nThe pharmacokinetic interactions between amprenavir and low doses of ritonavir or other protease \ninhibitors have not yet been evaluated in children. Additionally, as no dosing recommendations can be \nmade regarding the concomitant use of Agenerase oral solution and low dose ritonavir, the use of this \ncombination must be avoided in these patient populations.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n42 \n\n \nChildren less than 4 years of age: Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in children less than 4 \nyears of age. (see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ). \n \nElderly: the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amprenavir have not been studied in patients \nover 65 years of age. (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment: although no dose adjustment is considered necessary for amprenavir, Agenerase \noral solution is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see section 4.3).  \n \nHepatic impairment: Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment or \nfailure (see section 4.3) (see Summary of Product Characteristics of Agenerase Capsules for \nprescribing information) \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n \nBecause of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient propylene glycol, \nAgenerase oral solution is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years, pregnant \nwomen, patients with hepatic impairment or failure and patients with renal failure. Agenerase oral \nsolution is also contraindicated in patients treated with disulfiram or other medicinal products that \nreduce alcohol metabolism (e.g. metronidazole) and preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir \noral solution) or additional propylene glycol  (see section 4.4and 5.1). \n \nAgenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Co-administration may result in \ncompetitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicinal products and create the potential for \nserious and/or life-threatening adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. amiodarone, bepridil, \nquinidine, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide), respiratory depression and /or prolonged \nsedation (e.g. oral triazolam and oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administred midazolam,  \nsee section 4.5)) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia and ischaemia of other tissues, including \ncerebral or myocardial ischaemia (e.g. ergot derivatives). \n \nCombination of rifampicin with Agenerase with concomitant low-dose ritonavir is contraindicated. \n(see section 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \namprenavir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of \namprenavir (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients should be advised that Agenerase, or any other current antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. \nCurrent antiretroviral therapies, including Agenerase, have not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. Appropriate precautions \nshould continue to be taken. \n \nOn the basis of current pharmacodynamic data amprenavir should be used in combination with at least \ntwo other antiretrovirals. When amprenavir is administered as monotherapy, resistant viruses rapidly \nemerge (see section 5.1). \n \nLiver Disease: The principal route of metabolism of amprenavir and the propylene glycol excipient is \nvia the liver, Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment or failure \n(see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n43 \n\nPatients taking the oral solution of Agenerase, particularly those with renal impairment or those with \ndecreased ability to metabolise propylene glycol (e.g. those of Asian origin), should be monitored for \nadverse reactions potentially related to the high propylene glycol content (550 mg/ml), such as \nseizures, stupor, tachycardia, hyperosmolarity, lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, haemolysis. For patients \nwith renal failure, hepatic impairment or failure, children and pregnant women, see section 4.3. The \nconcomitant administration of Agenerase oral solution with disulfiram or other medicinal products that \nreduce alcohol metabolism (e.g. metronidazole), or preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir \noral solution) or additional propylene glycol is contraindicated (see sections 4.3and 4.5). \n \nMedicinal products – interactions \n \nConcomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the \nrisk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nThe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for \nmetabolism, thus concomitant use of Agenerase  with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended \ndue to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Caution must also be exercised if \nAgenerase is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is metabolized to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.  \nIn this situation, a reduced dose of atorvastatin should be considered. If treatment with a HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin are recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nFor some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International \nNormalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential \nsafety problems with concomitant use. \n \nThe use of Agenerase concomitantly with halofantrine or lidocaine (systemic) is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) should be used with caution. Agenerase \nmay be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these \nmedicinal products concomitantly (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant medicinal products \n(cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin) when co-administered with Agenerase (see section 4.5). \n \nCaution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and \nvardenafil) (see section 4.5). \n \nCaution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with delavirdine (see section 4.5). \n \nA reduction of rifabutin dosage of at least 50 % is recommended when administered with Agenerase \n(see section 4.5). \n \nBecause of the potential for metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal \ncontraceptives may be modified, but there is insufficient information to predict the nature of the \ninteractions. Therefore, alternative reliable methods of contraception are recommended for women of \nchildbearing potential (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of amprenavir with methadone leads to a decrease of methadone concentrations. \nTherefore, when methadone is co-administered with amprenavir, patients should be monitored for \nopiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose ritonavir is also given. No recommendations can \ncurrently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose when amprenavir is co-administered with \nmethadone. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n44 \n\nAgenerase oral solution contains vitamin E (46 IU/ml), therefore additional vitamin E supplementation \nis not recommended. \n \nAgenerase oral solution contains 1 mg potassium per ml. This must be considered when prescribing to \npatients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. \n \nAgenerase oral solution also contains 4 mg sodium per ml. This must be taken into consideration when \nprescribing to patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nRash / cutaneous reactions \n  \nMost patients with mild or moderate rash can continue Agenerase. Appropriate antihistamines (e.g. \ncetirizine dihydrochloride) may reduce pruritus and hasten the resolution of rash. Agenerase should be \npermanently discontinued when rash is accompanied with systemic symptoms or allergic symptoms or \nmucosal involvement (see section 4.8). \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nNew onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbations of existing diabetes mellitus have \nbeen reported in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors. In some of \nthese, the hyperglycaemia was severe and in some cases also associated with ketoacidosis. Many of \nthe patients had confounding medical conditions, some of which required therapy with agents that \nhave been associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.  \n \nLipodystrophy \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat \n(lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. \nKnowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis and \nprotease inhibitors and lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been \nhypothesised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older \nage, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated \nmetabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat \nredistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood \nglucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8). \n \nHaemophiliac patients \n \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some \npatients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued, or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.  \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n45 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAmprenavir is primarily metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal products that \neither share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may modify the pharmacokinetics of \namprenavir. Similarly, amprenavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal \nproducts that share this metabolic pathway. \n \nAssociations contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nCYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index \nAgenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows containing active substances that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). \nCo-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these active substances \nthus increasing their plasma level and leading to serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions \nsuch as cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, \nterfenadine) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) (see section \n4.3). \n \nRifampicin \nRifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause an 82% decrease in amprenavir \nAUC, which can result in virological failure and resistance development. During attempts to overcome \nthe decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high \nfrequency of liver reactions was seen. The combination of rifampicin and Agenerase with concomitant \nlow-dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \nSerum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by concomitant use of the herbal preparation St John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum). This is due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes by St John’s \nwort. Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort should therefore not be combined with Agenerase. \nIf a patient is already taking St John’s wort, check amprenavir and if possible viral levels and stop St \nJohn’s wort. Amprenavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s wort. The dose of amprenavir may \nneed adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St \nJohn’s wort (see section 4.3). \n \n• Other combinations \n \nOf note, the following interaction data was obtained in adults. \n \nAntiretroviral agents \n \n• Protease inhibitors (PIs) \n \nIndinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of indinavir were decreased by 38 %, 27 %, and 22 %, respectively, \nwhen given with amprenavir.  The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. The AUC, Cmin and \nCmax of amprenavir were increased by 33 %, 25 %, and 18 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is \nnecessary for either medicinal product when indinavir is administered in combination with \namprenavir. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n46 \n\nSaquinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of saquinavir were decreased by 19 % and 48 % and increased by \n21 %, respectively, when given with amprenavir.  The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. \nThe AUC, Cmin and Cmax of amprenavir were decreased by 32 %, 14 % and 37 %, respectively. No \ndose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when saquinavir is administered in \ncombination with amprenavir. \n \nNelfinavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of nelfinavir were increased by 15 %, 14 %, and 12 % respectively \nwhen given with amprenavir. The Cmax of amprenavir was decreased by 14 % whilst the AUC and Cmin \nwere increased by 9 % and 189 %, respectively. No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal \nproduct when nelfinavir is administered in combination with amprenavir (see also efavirenz below). \n \nRitonavir: the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the \nCmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was co-administered with amprenavir \ncapsules (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of \namprenavir capsules. In clinical trials, doses of amprenavir 600 mg twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily have been used; confirming the safety and efficacy of this regimen. \n \nAgenerase oral solution and ritonavir oral solution should not be co-administered (see section 4.3). \n \nLopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra): in an open-label, non-fasting pharmacokinetic study, the AUC, Cmax \nand Cmin of lopinavir were decreased by 38%, 28% and 52% respectively when amprenavir (750 mg \ntwice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily). \nIn the same study, the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of amprenavir were increased 72%, 12%, and 483%, \nrespectively, when compared to values after standard doses of amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily). \n \nThe amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) \nin combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40-\n50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily. Adding additional ritonavir to an amprenavir plus Kaletra regimen increase lopinavir Cmin \nvalues, but not amprenavir Cmin values. No dose recommendation can be given for the co-\nadministration of amprenavir and Kaletra, but close monitoring is advised because the safety and \nefficacy of this combination is unknown. \n \n• Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs):  \n \nZidovudine: the AUC and Cmax of zidovudine were increased by 31 % and 40 %, respectively, when \ngiven with amprenavir. The AUC and the Cmax of amprenavir were unaltered. No dose adjustment for \neither medicinal product is necessary when zidovudine is administered in combination with \namprenavir. \n \nLamivudine: the AUC and Cmax of lamivudine and amprenavir, respectively, were both unaltered  \nwhen these two medicinal products were given concomitantly. No dose adjustment is necessary for \neither medicinal product when lamivudine is administered in combination with amprenavir. \n \nAbacavir: the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of abacavir were unaltered when given with amprenavir. The AUC, \nCmin, and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 29 %, 27 %, and 47 % respectively. No dose \nadjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when abacavir is administered in combination \nwith amprenavir. \n \nDidanosine: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with \ndidanosine, however, due to its antacid component, it is recommended that didanosine and Agenerase \nshould be administered at least one hour apart (see Antacids below). \n \n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): \n \nEfavirenz: efavirenz has been seen to decrease the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin,ss of amprenavir by \napproximately 40 % in adults. When amprenavir is combined with ritonavir, the effect of efavirenz is \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n47 \n\ncompensated by the pharmacokinetic booster effect of ritonavir. Therefore, if efavirenz is given in \ncombination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose \nadjustment is necessary. \n \nFurther, if efavirenz is given in combination with amprenavir and nelfinavir, no dosage adjustment is \nnecessary for any of the medicinal products.  \n \nTreatment with efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the \nexposure to both protease inhibitors would be decreased. \n \nNo dose recommendation can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir with another protease \ninhibitor and efavirenz in children.  \n \nNevirapine: The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and the limited evidence available \nsuggest that nevirapine may decrease the serum concentrations of amprenavir. \n \nDelavirdine: the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of delavirdine were decreased by 61%, 47% and 88% \nrespectively when given with amprenavir. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by \n130%, 40% and 125% respectively.  \n \nNo dose recommendations can be given for the co-administration of amprenavir and delavirdine. If \nthese medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, as delavirdine may be less effective \ndue to decreased and potentially sub-therapeutic plasma concentrations. \n \nAntibiotics/antifungals \n \nRifabutin: co-administration of amprenavir with rifabutin resulted in a 193 % increase in rifabutin \nAUC and an increase of rifabutin-related adverse events. The increase in rifabutin plasma \nconcentration is likely to result from inhibition of rifabutin CYP3A4 mediated metabolism by \namprenavir. When it is clinically necessary to co-administer rifabutin with Agenerase, a dosage \nreduction of at least half the recommended dose of rifabutin is advised, although no clinical data are \navailable.  \n \nClarithromycin: the AUC and Cmin of clarithromycin were unaltered and the Cmax decreased by 10 % \nwhen given with amprenavir. The AUC, Cmin and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 18 %, 39 %, \nand 15 % respectively. No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when \nclarithromycin is administered in combination with amprenavir. \n \nErythromycin: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with \nerythromycin, however, plasma levels of both medicinal products may be increased when \nco-administered. \n \nKetoconazole / Itraconazole: the AUC and Cmax of ketoconazole were increased by 44 % and 19 % \nrespectively when given with amprenavir. The AUC and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 31 % \nand decreased by 16 % respectively. Itraconazole concentrations are expected to increase in the same \nmanner as ketoconazole. No dose adjustment for any of the medicinal products is necessary when \neither ketoconazole or itraconazole is administered in combination with amprenavir. \n \nMetronidazole: Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in patients treated with metronidazole (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nOther possible interactions \n \nOther medicinal products, listed below, including examples of substrates, inhibitors or inducers of \nCYP3A4, may lead to interactions when administered with Agenerase. The clinical significance of \nthese possible interactions is not known and has not been investigated. Patients should therefore be \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n48 \n\nmonitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicinal products when these are administered in \ncombination with Agenerase. \n \nAlcohol and inhibitors of alcohol metabolism: Agenerase oral solution contains propylene glycol (550 \nmg/ml), which is primarily metabolised via alcohol dehydrogenase. Therefore, concomitant \nadministration with disulfiram or other medicinal products that reduce alcohol metabolism (e.g. \nmetronidazole) or preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir oral solution) or propylene glycol is \ncontraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nAntacids: on the basis of the data for other protease inhibitors, it is advisable not to take antacids at the \nsame time as Agenerase, since its absorption may be impaired. It is recommended that antacids and \nAgenerase should be administered at least one hour apart. \n \nAnticonvulsant active substances: concomitant administration of anticonvulsant active substances \nknown as enzymatic inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) with amprenavir may lead \nto a decrease in the plasma concentrations of amprenavir. These combinations should be used with \ncaution and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nCalcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium \nchannel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, \nnimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these \nmedicinal products. \n \nErectile dysfunction agents: based on data for other protease inhibitors caution should be used when \nprescribing PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and vardenafil) to patients receiving Agenerase. Co-\nadministration with Agenerase may substantially increase PDE5 inhibitor plasma concentrations and \nassociated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.4). \n \nFluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg \ncapsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 \ndays in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the \nintrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86 % (90 % confidence interval 82-89 %). Greater \neffects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects \nincluding Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving \nritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with \nother corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide. Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of Agenerase with ritonavir and these glucocorticoids is not recommended \nunless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see \nsection 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of \nlocal and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may \nhave to be performed over a longer period. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on \nritonavir plasma levels is yet unknown. \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on \nCYP3A4 for metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased \nplasma concentrations when co-administered with Agenerase. Since increased concentrations of \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of \nthese medicinal products with Agenerase is not recommended. Atorvastatin is less dependent on \nCYP3A4 for metabolism. When used with Agenerase, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should \nbe administered. The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A4, and \ninteractions are not expected with protease inhibitors. If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended. \n \nImmunosuppressants: frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring of immunosuppresant levels is \nrecommended until levels have stabilised as plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and \ntacrolimus may be increased when co-administered with amprenavir (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n49 \n\n \nMidazolam: midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration with Agenerase \nwith or without ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No \ndrug interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of Agenerase with \nbenzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are \nexpected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore Agenerase should not \nbe co-administered with orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be \nused with co-administration of Agenerase and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of \nparenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam \nplasma levels. If Agenerase with or without ritonavir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical \nmonitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged \nsedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single \ndose of midazolam is administered. \n \nMethadone and opiate derivatives: co-administration of methadone with amprenavir resulted in a \ndecrease in the Cmxc and AUC of the active methadone enantiomer (R-enantiomer) of 25% and 13% \nrespectively, whilst the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the inactive methadone enantiomer (S-enantiomer) \nwere decreased by 48%, 40% and 23% respectively. When methadone is co-administered with \namprenavir, patients should be monitored for opiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose \nritonavir is also given. \n \nAs compared to a non-matched historical control group, co-administration of methadone and \namprenavir resulted in a 30%, 27% and 25% decrease in serum amprenavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin \nrespectively. No recommendations can currently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose \nwhen amprenavir is co-administered with methadone due to the inherent low reliability of non-\nmatched historical controls. \n \nOral anticoagulants: a reinforced monitoring of the International Normalised Ratio is recommended in \ncase of administration of Agenerase with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to a possible \ndecrease or increase of their antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4). \n \nSteroids: oestrogens and progestogens may interact with amprenavir. However, the information \ncurrently available is not sufficient for determining the nature of the interaction. Co-administration of \n0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg norethindrone resulted in a decrease of the amprenavir AUC \nand Cmin of 22% and 20% respectively, Cmax being unchanged. The Cmin of ethinyl estradiol was \nincreased by 32%, whilst the AUC and Cmin of norethindrone were increased by 18% and 45% \nrespectively. Alternative methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing \npotential. \n \nTricyclic antidepressants: careful monitoring of the therapeutic and adverse reactions of tricyclic \nantidepressants is recommended when they (for example desipramine and nortriptyline) are \nconcomitantly administered with Agenerase (see section 4.4). \n \nParoxetine: plasma concentrations of paroxetine may be significantly decreased when co-administered \nwith amprenavir and ritonavir. The mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. Based on \nhistorical comparison, amprenavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by paroxetine. \nTherefore, if paroxetine is co-administered with Agenerase and ritonavir, the recommended approach \nis a dose titration of paroxetine based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response. In addition, \npatients on stable dose of paroxetine who start treatment with Agenerase and ritonavir should be \nmonitored for antidepressant response. \n \nOther substances: plasma concentrations of other substances may be increased by amprenavir. These \ninclude substances such as: clozapine, cimetidine, dapsone and loratadine. \nSome substances (e.g. lidocaine (by systemic route) and halofantrine) given with Agenerase may \ncause serious adverse reactions. Concomitant use is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n50 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: there are no adequate data from the use of amprenavir in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. \nAgenerase oral solution should not be used during pregnancy due to the potential risk of toxicity to the \nfoetus from the propylene glycol content (see section 4.3).  \n \nLactation: amprenavir-related material was found in rat milk, but it is not known whether amprenavir \nis excreted in human milk. A reproduction study in pregnant rats dosed from the time of uterine \nimplantation through lactation showed reduced body weight gains in the offspring during the nursing \nperiod.  The systemic exposure to the dams associated with this finding was similar to exposure in \nhumans, following administration of the recommended dose. The subsequent development of the \noffspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by the maternal \nadministration of amprenavir. \n \nIt is therefore recommended that mothers being treated with Agenerase do not breast-feed their \ninfants.  Additionally, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in \norder to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children of at least 4 years of age in controlled \nclinical trials, in combination with various other antiretroviral agents. Adverse events considered \nassociated with the use of Agenerase are gastro-intestinal symptoms, rash and oral/peri-oral \nparaesthesia. Most undesirable effects associated with Agenerase therapy were mild to moderate in \nseverity, early in onset, and rarely treatment limiting. For many of these events it is unclear whether \nthey are related to Agenerase, to concomitant treatment used in the management of HIV disease or to \nthe disease process.  \n \nIn children, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. The \nfrequency categories used are: \n \nVery common  ≥ 1 in 10 \nCommon  ≥ 1 in 100 and < 1 in 10 \nUncommon  ≥ 1 in 1,000 and < 1 in 100 \nRare   ≥1 in 10,000 and < 1 in 1,000 \n \nFrequency categories for the events below have been based on clinical trials and postmarketing data.  \n \nMost of the adverse events below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) \ninvolving PI naïve subjects receiving Agenerase 1200mg twice daily. Events (grade 2-4) reported by \nstudy investigators as attributable to study medication and occurring in >1% of patients, are included \nas well as grade 3-4 treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities. Note that the background rates in \ncomparator groups were not taken into account. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nCommon: Elevated triglycerides, elevated amylase, abnormal fat redistribution, anorexia \nUncommon:  Hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolaemia \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n51 \n\nElevated triglycerides, elevated amylase and hyperglycaemia (grade 3-4) were reported primarily in \npatients with abnormal values at baseline. \n \nElevations in cholesterol were of grade 3-4 intensity. \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) \nin HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal \nand visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump). \n \nSymptoms of abnormal fat redistribution were infrequent in PROAB3001 with amprenavir. Only one \ncase (a buffalo hump) was reported in 113 (< 1 %) antiretroviral naive subjects treated with \namprenavir in combination with lamivudine/zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks. In study \nPROAB3006, seven cases (3 %) were reported in 245 NRTI-experienced subjects treated with \namprenavir and in 27 (11 %) of 241 subjects treated with indinavir, in combination with various \nNRTIs for a median duration of 56 weeks (p< 0.001). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as \nhypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and \nhyperlactataemia (see section 4.4). \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nCommon:  Mood disorders, depressive disorders \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nVery Common:  Headache \nCommon:  Oral/perioral paraesthesia, tremors, sleep disorders \n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n \nVery Common:  Diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, dyspeptic symptoms, loose stools \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nCommon:  Elevated transaminases \nUncommon:  Hyperbilirubinaemia \n \nElevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinaemia (grade 3-4) were reported primarily in patients with \nabnormal values at baseline. Almost all subjects with abnormal liver function tests were co-infected \nwith Hepatitis B or C virus.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n \nVery Common:   Rash \nUncommon:  Angioedema \nRare:   Stevens Johnson syndrome \n \nRashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapular cutaneous eruptions, with or \nwithout pruritus, occurring during the second week of therapy and resolving spontaneously within two \nweeks, without discontinuation of treatment with amprenavir. A higher incidence of rash was reported \nin patients treated with amprenavir in combination with efavirenz. Severe or life-threatening skin \nreactions have also occurred in patients treated with amprenavir (see section 4.4). \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n52 \n\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis, and rarely rhabdomyolysis have been reported with protease \ninhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues. \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery Common:  Fatigue \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise (see section 4.4). \n \nLimited experience with Agenerase oral solution indicate a similar safety profile as for the capsules. \n \nIn PI experienced patients receiving Agenerase capsules 600 mg twice daily and low dose ritonavir, \n100 mg twice daily, the nature and frequency of adverse events (grade 2-4) and Grade 3/4 laboratory \nabnormalities were similar to those observed with Agenerase alone, with the exception of elevated \ntriglyceride levels, and elevated CPK levels which were very common in patients receiving Agenerase \nand low dose ritonavir. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited reports of overdose with Agenerase. If overdose occurs, the patient should be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and standard supportive treatment provided as \nnecessary. Agenerase oral solution contains a large amount of propylene glycol (see section 4.4). In \nthe event of overdosage, monitoring and management of acid-base abnormalities are recommended. \nPropylene glycol can be removed by hemodialysis. However, since amprenavir is highly protein \nbound, dialysis is unlikely to be helpful in reducing blood levels of amprenavir. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: protease inhibitor; ATC Code: J05A E05 \n \nMechanism of Action \n \nAmprenavir is a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 \nprotease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in \nthe formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. The in vitro antiviral activity observed with \nfosamprenavir is due to the presence of trace amounts of amprenavir. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and \nchronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 µM \nin acutely infected cells and was 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg/ml). The \nrelationship between in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication \nin humans has not been defined. \n \nResistance \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n53 \n\n \nIn vitro \n \nHIV-1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial \npassage experiments. Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had \ndeveloped I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. \n \n \n \nIn vivo \n \n\na) ART-naïve or PI-naïve patients \n \n\n(Note: Agenerase is not approved in ART-naive or PI-naive patients). \n \nVarious regimens have been assessed in the amprenavir/fosamprenavir development programs with \nand without co-administration of ritonavir. Analysis of the virological failure samples across these \nregimens defined four main resistance pathways: V32I+I47V, I50V, I54L/M and I84V. Additional \nmutations observed which may contribute to resistance were: L10V/F/R, I13V, K20R/T, L33F/V, \nM36I, M46I/L, I47V/L Q58E, I62V, L63P, V77I, I85V, and I93L.   \n\n \nWhen ART naïve patients were treated with the currently approved doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir, \nas for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were rarely observed. Sixteen of \n434 ART-naïve patients who received fosamprenavir 700mg/ritonavir 100mg twice daily in \nESS100732 experienced virological failure by Week 48 with 14 isolates genotyped. Three of 14 \nisolates had protease resistance mutations. One resistance mutation was observed in each of 3 isolates: \nK20K/R, I54I/L and I93I/L respectively.  \n \nGenotypic analysis of isolates from 13 of 14 paediatric patients exhibiting virological failure among \nthe 59 PI-naïve patients enrolled, demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults. \n \n b) PI-experienced patients \n \nAmprenavir  \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced patients, PRO30017 (amprenavir 600 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice \ndaily in sub-study A and B with 80 and 37 patients respectively), the following mutations emerged in \npatients with virological failure: L10F/I/V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I/L, \nI47V, G48V, I50V, I54L/M/T/V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/I, I84V, I85V, L90M and \nI93L/M. \n \nFosamprenavir \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced patients, APV30003 and its extension, APV30005 (fosamprenavir 700 \nmg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in patients experiencing \nvirological failure through 96 weeks: L10F/I, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46I/L, I47V, I50V, \nI54L/M/S, A71I/T/V, G73S, V82A, I84V, and L90M.  \n \nIn the paediatric studies APV20003 and APV29005, 67 PI-experienced patients were treated with \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir and of 22 virological failure isolates genotyped, nine patients were found \nwith treatment-emergent protease mutations.  The mutational profiles were similar to those described \nfor PI-experienced adults treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir. \n \n \nAnalyses based on genotypic resistance testing. \nGenotypic interpretation systems may be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir in subjects with PI-resistant isolates. The current (July 2006) ANRS AC-11 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n54 \n\nalgorithm for fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations \nV32I+I47A/V, or I50V, or at least four mutations among: L10F/I/V, L33F, M36I, I54A/L/M/S/T/V, \nI62V, V82A/C/F/G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance). \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \n \nAnalyses based on phenotypic resistance testing. \nClinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems may be used in association with the genotypic \ndata to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with PI-\nresistant isolates.  Resistance testing diagnostic companies have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs \nfor FPV/RTV that can be used to interpret resistance test results. \n \nCross-Resistance \n \nHIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial \npassage experiments. Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had \ndeveloped I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. Each of these four genetic patterns \nassociated with reduced susceptibility to amprenavir produces some cross-resistance to ritonavir but \nsusceptibility to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir is generally retained. There are currently data on \ncross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fosamprenavir resistance \npathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations. Based on data from twenty-five \nantiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed \nBaseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir) the resistance pathways \nassociated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ritonavir (three of 25 \nisolates), darunavir/ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), \nlopinavir/ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ritonavir (four \nof 24 isolates)..  Conversely amprenavir retains activity against some isolates with resistance to other \nPIs and this retained activity would depend on the number and type of protease resistance mutations \npresent in the isolates. \n \nThe number of key PI-resistance mutations increases markedly the longer a failing PI-containing \nregimen is continued. Early discontinuation of failing therapies is recommended in order to limit the \naccumulation of multiple mutations, which may be detrimental to a subsequent rescue regimen. \n \nCross resistance between amprenavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, is unlikely to occur because \nthe enzyme targets are different. \n \nAgenerase is not recommended for use as monotherapy, due to the rapid emergence of resistant virus. \n \nClinical experience:  \n \nPI-experienced adults, boosted Agenerase capsules \n \nThe evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on \nstudy PRO30017, a randomized, open-label study, in which PI-experienced adults experiencing \nvirological failure (viral load ≥1000 copies/ml) received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) in \ncombination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard of \ncare (SOC) PI, predominantly boosted with low-dose RTV.  \n \nOne hundred and sixty-three (163) patients with virus sensitive to Agenerase, at least one other PI, and \nat least one NRTI were included in PRO30017 substudy A. The primary analysis assessed the non-\ninferiority of APV/r to the SOC PI group with respect to time-weighted average change from baseline \n(AAUCMB) in plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) at week 16 using a non-inferiority margin of 0.4 log10 \ncopies/ml. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n55 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResults at week 16  \n \n Amprenavir / ritonavir \n\n (n = 80) \nSOC PI (n = 83): \n\nIndinavir / RTV (29%) \nLopinavir / RTV (36%) \nSaquinavir / RTV(20%) \n\nTreatment \ndifference \n\nBaseline \ncharacteristics \n\n  \n\nMedian HIV-1 RNA \n(log10 copies/ml) \n(range) \n\n4.11 (2.51–5.97) \n \n\n4.10 (2.34–6.07)  \n\nMedian CD4 (cells/ml) \n(range) \n \n\n265 (8–837) 322 (36–955)  \n\nPrior number of PIs \ntaken [n (%)] \n1 \n2 \n≥ 3 \n\n \n \n\n27 (34) \n18 (23)  \n35 (44)  \n\n \n \n\n25 (30) \n29 (35) \n29 (35) \n\n \n\nMedian number of PI \nprimary mutations 1 \n\n \n1.0 (range 0-2) \n\n \n1.0 (range 0-2) \n\n \n\nPrior number of NRTIs \ntaken [n (%)] \n≥ 4 \n\n \n49 (61) \n\n \n40 (48) \n\n \n\nOutcomes a   \nMean plasma HIV-1 \nRNA AAUCMB  \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n− 1.315 − 1.343 0.043b \n(−0.250, 0.335)c \n\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA \nbelow 400 copies/ml \n(%) \n\n66 70 6 \n(−21, 9)c \n\na  Intent To Treat (Exposed) Population: Observed analysis \nb  Mean stratified difference \nc 95% confidence interval \n1  Primary mutations were as defined by the IAS USA at the time of the original analysis, 2002 D30N, \nM46I/L, G48V, I50V, V82A/F/T/S, I84V, L90M. \n \nHeavily pre-treated children, unboosted Agenerase \n \nThe evidence of efficacy of unboosted Agenerase was based on two uncontrolled clinical studies \ninvolving 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, 152 of whom were PI experienced. \nThe studies evaluated Agenerase oral solution and capsules at doses of 15 mg/kg three times daily, 20 \nmg/kg three times daily, 20 mg/kg twice daily and 22.5 mg/kg twice daily although the majority \nreceived 20 mg/kg twice daily. Those of at least 13 years of age and weighing at least 50 kg received \n1200 mg Agenerase twice daily. Concomitant low dose ritonavir was not administered and the \nmajority of the PI experienced subjects had prior exposure to at least one (78 %) or two (42 %) of the \nNRTIs co-administered with Agenerase.

The absolute \nbioavailability is unknown due to the lack of an acceptable intravenous formulation for use in man. \nApproximately 90 % of an orally administered radiolabelled amprenavir dose was recovered in the \nurine and the faeces, primarily as amprenavir metabolites. Following oral administration, the mean \ntime (tmax) to maximal serum concentrations of amprenavir is between 1-2 hours for the capsule and \n0.5 to 1 hour for the oral solution. A second peak is observed after 10 to 12 hours and may represent \neither delayed absorption or enterohepatic recirculation. \n \nAt therapeutic dosages (1200 mg twice daily), the mean maximum steady state concentration (Cmax,ss) \nof amprenavir capsules is 5.36 μg/ml (0.92-9.81) and the minimum steady state concentration (Cmin,ss) \nis 0.28 μg/ml (0.12-0.51). The mean AUC over a dosing interval of 12 hours is 18.46 μg.h/ml (3.02-\n32.95). The 50 mg and 150 mg capsules have been shown to be bioequivalent. The bioavailability of \nthe oral solution at equivalent doses is lower than that of the capsules, with an AUC and Cmax \napproximately 14 % and 19 % lower, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \nWhile administration of amprenavir with food results in a 25 % reduction in AUC, it had no effect on \nthe concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12). Therefore, although food affects the \nextent and rate of absorption, the steady-state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) was not affected by food \nintake. \n \nDistribution: the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 430 litres (6 l/kg assuming a 70 kg \nbody weight), suggesting a large volume of distribution, with penetration of amprenavir freely into \ntissues beyond the systemic circulation. The concentration of amprenavir in the cerebrospinal fluid is \nless than 1 % of plasma concentration. \n \nIn in vitro studies, the protein binding of amprenavir is approximately 90 %.  Amprenavir is primarily \nbound to the alpha–1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), but also to albumin. Concentrations of AAG have \nbeen shown to decrease during the course of antiretroviral therapy. This change will decrease the total  \nactive substance concentration in the plasma, however the amount of unbound amprenavir, which is \nthe active moiety, is likely to be unchanged. While absolute free active substance concentrations \nremain constant, the percent of free active substance will fluctuate directly with total active substance \nconcentrations at steady-state go from Cmax,ss to Cmin,ss over the course of the dosing interval.  This will \nresult in a fluctuation in the apparent volume of distribution of total active substance, but the volume \nof distribution of free active substance does not change. \n \nClinically significant binding displacement interactions involving medicinal products primarily bound \nto AAG are generally not observed. Therefore, interactions with amprenavir due to protein binding \ndisplacement are highly unlikely. \n \nMetabolism: amprenavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with less than 3 % excreted unchanged \nin the urine. The primary route of metabolism is via the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme. \nAmprenavir is a substrate of and inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore medicinal products that are inducers, \ninhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be used with caution when administered concurrently with \nAgenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElimination: the plasma elimination half-life of amprenavir ranges from 7.1 to 10.6 hours. Following \nmultiple oral doses of amprenavir (1200 mg twice a day), there is no significant active substance \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n57 \n\naccumulation. The primary route of elimination of amprenavir is via hepatic metabolism with less than \n3 % excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolites and unchanged amprenavir account for \napproximately 14 % of the administered amprenavir dose in the urine, and approximately 75 % in the \nfaeces. \n \nSpecial populations: \n \nPaediatrics: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir in children (4 years of age and above) are similar to \nthose in adults. Dosages of 20 mg/kg twice a day and 15 mg/kg three times a day with Agenerase \ncapsules provided similar daily amprenavir exposure to 1200 mg twice a day in adults. Amprenavir is \n14 % less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules \nand Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis. \n \nElderly: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment: patients with renal impairment have not been specifically studied. Less than 3 % \nof the therapeutic dose of amprenavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. The impact of renal \nimpairment on amprenavir elimination should be minimal therefore, no initial dose adjustment is \nconsidered necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment: the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir are significantly altered in patients with \nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment. The AUC increased nearly three fold in patients with \nmoderate impairment and four fold in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Clearance also \ndecreased in a corresponding manner to the AUC.  Agenerase oral solution should not be used in \npatients with hepatic impairment or failure (see section 4.3). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies with amprenavir in mice and rats, there were benign \nhepatocellular adenomas in males at exposure levels equivalent to 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rats) \nthose in humans given 1200 mg twice daily of amprenavir alone. In male mice altered hepatocellular \nfoci were seen at doses that were at least 2.0 times human therapeutic exposure. \n \nA higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was seen in all amprenavir male mouse treatment \ngroups. However, this increase was not statistically significantly different from male control mice by \nappropriate tests. The mechanism for the hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas found in these \nstudies has not been elucidated and the significance of the observed effects for humans is uncertain. \nHowever, there is little evidence from the exposure data in humans, both in clinical trials and from \nmarketed use, to suggest that these findings are of clinical significance. \n \nAmprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genetic toxicity assays, \nincluding bacterial reverse mutation (Ames Test), mouse lymphoma, rat micronucleus, and \nchromosome aberration in human peripheral lymphocytes. \nIn toxicological studies with mature animals, the clinically relevant findings were mostly confined to \nthe liver and gastrointestinal disturbances.  Liver toxicity consisted of increases in liver enzymes, liver \nweights and microscopic findings including hepatocyte necrosis.  This liver toxicity can be monitored \nfor and detected in clinical use, with measurements of AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.  \nHowever, significant liver toxicity has not been observed in patients treated in clinical studies, either \nduring administration of Agenerase or after discontinuation.  \n \nAmprenavir did not affect fertility.  Local toxicity and sensitising potential was absent in animal \nstudies, but slight irritating properties to the rabbit eye were identified. \nToxicity studies in young animals, treated from four days of age, resulted in high mortality in both the \ncontrol animals and those receiving amprenavir.  These results imply that young animals lack fully \ndeveloped metabolic pathways enabling them to excrete amprenavir or some critical components of \nthe formulation (e.g. propylene glycol, PEG 400). However, the possibility of anaphylactic reaction \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n58 \n\nrelated to PEG 400 cannot be excluded.  In clinical studies, the safety and efficacy of amprenavir have \nnot yet been established in children below four years of age.  \n \nIn pregnant mice, rabbits and rats there were no major effects on embryo-foetal development.  \nHowever, at systemic plasma exposures significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rat) \nthan the expected human exposures during therapeutic dosing, a number of minor changes, including \nthymic elongation and minor skeletal variations were seen, indicating developmental delay.  A dose-\ndependent increase in placental weight was found in the rabbit and rat which may indicate effects on \nplacental function. It is therefore recommended that women of child-bearing potential taking \nAgenerase should practice effective contraception (e.g. barrier methods). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them even if \n\ntheir symptoms are the same as yours. \n• If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1) What Agenerase is and what it is used for  \n2) Before you take Agenerase \n3) How to take Agenerase \n4) Possible side effects \n5) How to store Agenerase \n6) Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT AGENERASE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAgenerase belongs to a group of antiviral medicines called protease inhibitors. These medicines are \nused for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n \nAgenerase is used in protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age \nof 4 years. Agenerase is prescribed for use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \nYour doctor will normally direct that Agenerase capsules should be taken with low doses of ritonavir \nto boost its efficacy. The choice of Agenerase will be based on any resistance testing your doctor may \nhave carried out and your treatment history. \n \nThe benefit of amprenavir boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated in PI naïve patients. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AGENERASE \n \nDo not take Agenerase \n-  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amprenavir or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nAgenerase. \n \n-  if you have severe liver disease (see ‘Take special care with Agenerase’). \n \n- you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may \nbe available without prescription) \n\n- pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia) \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems) \n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n- amiodarone, quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart beat) \n- flecainide and propafenone (heart medicines) \n- triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and  / or relieve \n\nanxiety) \n- bepridil (used to treat hypertension). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n76 \n\n-  if you are currently taking any products containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as \nthis may stop Agenerase from working properly (see Taking/using other medicines). \n \nTell your doctor if you have any of these listed conditions, or are taking any of the medicines listed \nabove. \n \nTake special care with Agenerase \nYou will need to take Agenerase every day. This medicine helps to control your condition, but it is not \na cure for HIV infection. You can still continue to develop other infections and other illnesses \nassociated with HIV disease. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. Do not stop taking \nyour medicine without first talking to your doctor. \n \nIf your doctor has recommended that you take Agenerase capsules together with low doses of \nritonavir, used to boost its activity, then please make sure that you carefully read the ritonavir Package \nLeaflet before starting therapy.  \n \nAt present, there is insufficient information to recommend the use of Agenerase in children less than \nfour years of age. There is also insufficient information to recommend the use of Agenerase capsules \nboosted with ritonavir in children of 4 to 12 years of age or any patients weighing less than fifty \nkilograms. \n \nAgenerase may interact with other medicines that you are taking, so it is important that you read the \nnext section “Taking/using other medicines” before taking this medicine. \n \nYou should tell your doctor about any medical conditions that you have or have had.  \n- Please speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and \npotentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function. \n\n- The use of Agenerase together with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with liver disease. \nIf your liver disease is severe you must not use this combination. \n\n- Agenerase capsules (without the boosting effect of ritonavir) have been studied in patients with \nliver impairment. If you suffer from liver disease and your doctor decides to use unboosted \nAgenerase capsules (that is without ritonavir), the dose of Agenerase may need to be adjusted. \n\n- There have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia taking protease \ninhibitors. The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control \nbleeding. \n\n- Redistribution, accumulation or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination \nantiretroviral therapy. Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat. \n\n- In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, \nsigns and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s \nimmune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor. \n \nBone problems \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n77 \n\nTreatment with Agenerase has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others \nby sexual contact or by blood transfer. You should continue to use appropriate precautions to prevent \nthis. \n \nTaking/using other medicines \nBefore starting treatment with Agenerase, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or \nhave recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is \nvery important, as taking some types of medicines at the same time as Agenerase can strengthen or \nweaken the effect of the medicines. This can sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  \n \nThere are some medicines that you must not take with Agenerase (please see ‘Do not take Agenerase’ \nfor further information). \n \nAgenerase may interact with certain other medicines. The use of the following medicines, together \nwith Agenerase, should only take place on the basis of medical advice: anaesthetics (e.g. lidocaine), \nantibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, clarithromycin, dapsone and erythromycin), antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, \nitraconazole), antimalarials (e.g. halofantrine), anticonvulsant medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, \nphenytoin and phenobarbital), calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, \nisradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil), cholesterol lowering \nmedicines (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin), erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil \nand vardenafil), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. delavirdine, efavirenz and \nnevirapine), opioids (e.g. methadone), hormones like oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. hormonal \ncontraceptives such as the ‘pill’), some glucocorticoids (e.g. fluticasone propionate and budesonide), \ntricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine and nortriptyline), sedative agents (e.g. midazolam \nadministered by injection), paroxetine, and others (e.g. clozapine and loratadine). \n \nIf you are taking certain medicines that can cause serious side effects, such as carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, lidocaine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin, tricyclic antidepressants and \nwarfarin, at the same time as you are taking Agenerase, your doctor may carry out additional blood \ntests to minimise any potential safety problems. \n \nIf you are taking the contraceptive pill, it is recommended that you use an alternative method (e.g. a \ncondom) to prevent pregnancy while you are taking Agenerase. The concomitant use of Agenerase \nand contraceptive pill may result in a decrease of the therapeutic effect of Agenerase. \n \nTaking Agenerase with food and drink \nAgenerase capsules should be swallowed whole with water or another drink. They can be taken with \nor without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nInform your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon. The safe use of \nAgenerase in pregnancy has not been established. Ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking any \nmedicine. \n \nBreast feeding your baby is not recommended while you are taking Agenerase. It is recommended that \nHIV positive women do not breast feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects of Agenerase on the ability to drive and use machines have been done. If \nAgenerase makes you dizzy, do not operate any tools or machines. \n \nImportant information about ingredients of Agenerase capsules \nThese capsules contain glycerol, which can cause adverse effects in high doses.

HOW TO TAKE AGENERASE  \n \nAlways take Agenerase exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nIf you need to take an antacid for indigestion, or if you are taking a drug containing an antacid (e.g. \ndidanosine), you are advised to take it more than an hour before or after Agenerase, otherwise the \neffects of Agenerase may be reduced. \n \n- Swallow Agenerase capsules whole with water or another drink. They can be taken with or \n\nwithout food. \n \n- Adults and adolescents (of 12 years of age and older) (greater than 50 kg body weight): the \n\nusual dose of Agenerase capsules is 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. If your doctor decides it is \ninappropriate for you to take ritonavir, you will need to take increased doses of Agenerase (1200 \nmg twice a day). \n\n \n- Children (4 to 12 years) and patients less than 50 kg body weight: the dose will be calculated \n\naccording to your weight by your doctor. The usual dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg for \neach kg of body weight, twice a day. You should not take more than 2400 mg per day. \nIn some cases, your doctor may adapt the dose of Agenerase when other drugs are administered \nconcomitantly with Agenerase. \n\n \nTo derive the full benefit of Agenerase, it is very important that you take the full daily dose prescribed \nby your doctor. \n \nAn oral solution of Agenerase is available for children or adults unable to swallow capsules. \n \nIf you take more Agenerase than you should \nIf you have taken more than the prescribed dose of Agenerase, you should contact your doctor or \npharmacist immediately for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Agenerase \nIf you forget to take a dose of Agenerase, take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Agenerase \nYou must not stop taking Agenerase without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Agenerase can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the undesirable effects that \noccur are caused by Agenerase, by other medicines taken at the same time or by the HIV disease. For \nthis reason, it is very important that you inform your doctor about any changes in your health. \n \nVery common side effects (these can affect more than 10 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Headache, feeling tired  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n79 \n\n• Diarrhoea, feeling sick, vomiting, flatulence \n• Skin Rashes (red, raised or itchy) – Occasionally, the skin rash may be severe and you may \n\nhave to stop taking this medicine. \n \nCommon side effects (these can affect 1 to 10 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Increases in triglycerides (a type of blood fat), changes in body shape because of fat \nredistribution,  \n\n• Moodiness, depression, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite \n• Tingling or numbness around the lips and mouth, uncontrolled movements \n• Pain, discomfort or excess acid in the stomach, loose stools,  \n• Increases in enzymes produced by the liver called transaminases, increases of an enzyme \n\nproduced by the pancreas called amylase \n \n\nUncommon side effects (these can affect less than 1 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Increases in blood sugar or cholesterol (a type of blood fat) \n• Increases in the blood of a substance called bilirubin \n• Swelling of the face, lips and tongue (angioedema) \n \n\nRare side effects (these can affect 1 in 1,000 patients treated) \n \n\n• A severe or life-threatening skin reaction (Stevens Johnson syndrome) \n \nOther possible effects \n \nIn patients with haemophilia Type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \nprotease inhibitors. Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from your doctor. \n \nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with antiretroviral \ntherapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions, these muscle \ndisorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat \ndistribution. These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen \n(belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck (‘buffalo \nhump’). The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. \nCombination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, \nhyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell \nyour doctor or pharmacist.  \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE AGENERASE \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not store above 30o C. Keep the container tightly closed, in order to protect from moisture. \n \nDo not use Agenerase after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n80 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them even if \n\ntheir symptoms are the same as yours. \n• If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1)  What Agenerase is and what it is used for.  \n2)  Before you take Agenerase \n3)  How to take Agenerase \n4)  Possible side effects \n5)  How to store Agenerase \n6) Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT AGENERASE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAgenerase belongs to a group of antiviral medicines called protease inhibitors. These medicines are \nused for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n \nAgenerase is used in protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age \nof 4 years. Agenerase is prescribed for use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \nYour doctor will normally direct that Agenerase capsules should be taken with low doses of ritonavir \nto boost its efficacy. The choice of Agenerase will be based on any resistance testing your doctor may \nhave carried out and your treatment history. \n \nThe benefit of amprenavir boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated in PI naïve patients. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AGENERASE \n \nDo not take Agenerase \n-  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amprenavir or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nAgenerase. \n \n-  if you have severe liver disease (see ‘Take special care with Agenerase’). \n \n- you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may \nbe available without prescription) \n\n- pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia) \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems) \n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n- amiodarone, quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart beat) \n- flecainide and propafenone (heart medicines) \n- triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and  / or relieve \n\nanxiety) \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n83 \n\n- bepridil (used to treat hypertension). \n- if you are currently taking any  products containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as \n\nthis may stop Agenerase from working properly (see Taking/using  other medicines). \n \nTell your doctor if you have any of these listed conditions, or are taking any of the medicines listed \nabove. \n \nTake special care with Agenerase \nYou will need to take Agenerase every day. This medicine helps to control your condition, but it is not \na cure for HIV infection. You can still continue to develop other infections and other illnesses \nassociated with HIV disease. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. Do not stop taking \nyour medicine without first talking to your doctor. \n \nIf your doctor has recommended that you take Agenerase capsules together with low doses of \nritonavir, used to boost its activity, then please make sure that you carefully read the ritonavir Package \nLeaflet before starting therapy.  \n \nAt present, there is insufficient information to recommend the use of Agenerase in children less than \nfour years of age. There is also insufficient information to recommend the use of Agenerase capsules \nboosted with ritonavir in children of 4 to 12 years of age or any patients weighing less than fifty \nkilograms. \n \nAgenerase may interact with other medicines that you are taking, so it is important that you read the \nnext section  “Taking/using other medicines” before taking this medicine. \n \nYou should tell your doctor about any medical conditions that you have or have had.  \n- Please speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and \npotentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function. \n\n- The use of Agenerase together with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with liver disease. \nIf your liver disease is severe you must not use this combination. \n\n- Agenerase capsules (without the boosting effect of ritonavir) have been studied in patients with \nliver impairment. If you suffer from liver disease and your doctor decides to use unboosted \nAgenerase capsules (that is without ritonavir), the dose of Agenerase may need to be adjusted. \n\n- There have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia taking protease \ninhibitors. The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control \nbleeding. \n\n- Redistribution, accumulation or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination \nantiretroviral therapy. Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat. \n\n- In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, \nsigns and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s \nimmune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor. \n \nBone problems \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n84 \n\nTreatment with Agenerase has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others \nby sexual contact or by blood transfer. You should continue to use appropriate precautions to prevent \nthis. \n \nTaking/using other medicines \nBefore starting treatment with Agenerase, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or \nhave recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is \nvery important, as taking some types of medicines at the same time as Agenerase can strengthen or \nweaken the effect of the medicines. This can sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  \n \nThere are some medicines that you must not take with Agenerase (please see ‘Do not take Agenerase’ \nfor further information). \n \nAgenerase may interact with certain other medicines.

The concomitant use of Agenerase \nand contraceptive pill may result in a decrease of the therapeutic effect of Agenerase. \n \nTaking Agenerase with food and drink \nAgenerase capsules should be swallowed whole with water or another drink. They can be taken with \nor without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nInform your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon. The safe use of \nAgenerase in pregnancy has not been established.

For \nthis reason, it is very important that you inform your doctor about any changes in your health. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n86 \n\nVery common side effects (these can affect more than 10 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Headache, feeling tired  \n• Diarrhoea, feeling sick, vomiting, flatulence \n• Skin Rashes (red, raised or itchy) – Occasionally, the skin rash may be severe and you may \n\nhave to stop taking this medicine. \n \nCommon side effects (these can affect 1 to 10 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Increases in triglycerides (a type of blood fat), changes in body shape because of fat \nredistribution,  \n\n• Moodiness, depression, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite \n• Tingling or numbness around the lips and mouth, uncontrolled movements \n• Pain, discomfort or excess acid in the stomach, loose stools,  \n• Increases in enzymes produced by the liver called transaminases, increases of an enzyme \n\nproduced by the pancreas called amylase \n \n\nUncommon side effects (these can affect less than 1 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Increases in blood sugar or cholesterol (a type of blood fat) \n• Increases in the blood of a substance called bilirubin \n• Swelling of the face, lips and tongue (angioedema) \n \n\nRare side effects (these can affect 1 in 1,000 patients treated) \n \n\n• A severe or life-threatening skin reaction (Stevens Johnson syndrome) \n \nOther possible effects \n \nIn patients with haemophilia Type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \nprotease inhibitors.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them even if \n\ntheir symptoms are the same as yours. \n• If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1)  What Agenerase is and what it is used for  \n2)  Before you take Agenerase \n3)  How to take Agenerase \n4)  Possible side effects \n5)  How to store Agenerase \n6) Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT AGENERASE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAgenerase belongs to a group of antiviral medicines called protease inhibitors.  These medicines are \nused for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n \nAgenerase is used in protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age \nof 4 years. Agenerase is prescribed for use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \nYour doctor will normally direct that Agenerase capsules should be taken with low doses of ritonavir \nto boost its efficacy. The choice of Agenerase will be based on any resistance testing your doctor may \nhave carried out and your treatment history. \n \nThe benefit of amprenavir boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated in PI naïve patients. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AGENERASE \n \nDo not take Agenerase \n-  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amprenavir or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nAgenerase. \n \n-  if you have severe liver disease (see ‘Take special care with Agenerase’). \n \n- you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may \nbe available without prescription) \n\n- pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia) \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems) \n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n- amiodarone, quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart beat) \n- flecainide and propafenone (heart medicines) \n- triazolam, oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and  / or relieve \n\nanxiety) \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n90 \n\n- bepridil (used to treat hypertension). \n- if you are currently taking any  products containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as \n\nthis may stop Agenerase from working properly (see Taking/using  other medicines). \n \nTell your doctor if you have any of these listed conditions, or are taking any of the medicines listed \nabove. \n \nTake special care with Agenerase \nYou will need to take Agenerase every day. This medicine helps to control your condition, but it is not \na cure for HIV infection. You can still continue to develop other infections and other illnesses \nassociated with HIV disease. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. Do not stop taking \nyour medicine without first talking to your doctor. \n \nIf your doctor has recommended that you take Agenerase capsules together with low doses of \nritonavir, used to boost its activity, then please make sure that you carefully read the ritonavir Package \nLeaflet before starting therapy.  \n \nAt present, there is insufficient information to recommend the use of Agenerase in children less than \nfour years of age. There is also insufficient information to recommend the use of Agenerase capsules \nboosted with ritonavir in children of 4 to 12 years of age or any patients weighing less than fifty \nkilograms. \n \nAgenerase may interact with other medicines that you are taking, so it is important that you read the \nnext section “Taking/using other medicines” before taking this medicine. \n \nYou should tell your doctor about any medical conditions that you have or have had.  \n- Please speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and \npotentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function. \n\n- The use of Agenerase together with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with liver disease. \nIf your liver disease is severe you must not use this combination. \n\n- Agenerase capsules (without the boosting effect of ritonavir) have been studied in patients with \nliver impairment. If you suffer from liver disease and your doctor decides to use unboosted \nAgenerase capsules (that is without ritonavir), the dose of Agenerase may need to be adjusted. \n\n- There have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia taking protease \ninhibitors. The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control \nbleeding. \n\n- Redistribution, accumulation or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination \nantiretroviral therapy. Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat. \n\n- In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, \nsigns and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s \nimmune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor. \n \nBone problems \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n91 \n\nTreatment with Agenerase has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others \nby sexual contact or by blood transfer. You should continue to use appropriate precautions to prevent \nthis. \n \nTaking/using other medicines \nBefore starting treatment with Agenerase, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or \nhave recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is \nvery important, as taking some types of medicines at the same time as Agenerase can strengthen or \nweaken the effect of the medicines. This can sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  \n \nThere are some medicines that you must not take with Agenerase (please see ‘Do not take Agenerase’ \nfor further information). \n \nAgenerase may interact with certain other medicines. The use of the following medicines, together \nwith Agenerase, should only take place on the basis of medical advice: anaesthetics (e.g. lidocaine), \nantibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, clarithromycin, dapsone and erythromycin), antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, \nitraconazole), antimalarials (e.g. halofantrine), anticonvulsant medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, \nphenytoin and phenobarbital), calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, \nisradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil), cholesterol lowering \nmedicines (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin), erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil \nand vardenafil), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. delavirdine, efavirenz and \nnevirapine), opioids (e.g. methadone), hormones like oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. hormonal \ncontraceptives such as the ‘pill’), some glucocorticoids (e.g. fluticasone propionate and budesonide), \ntricyclic antidepressants (i.e. desipramine and nortriptyline), sedative agents (e.g. midazolam \nadministered by injection), paroxetine, and others (e.g. clozapine and loratadine). \n \nIf you are taking certain medicines that can cause serious side effects, such as carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, lidocaine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin, tricyclic antidepressants and \nwarfarin, at the same time as you are taking Agenerase, your doctor may carry out additional blood \ntests to minimise any potential safety problems. \n \nIf you are taking the contraceptive pill, it is recommended that you use an alternative method (e.g. a \ncondom) to prevent pregnancy while you are taking Agenerase. The concomitant use of Agenerase \nand contraceptive pill may result in a decrease of the therapeutic effect of Agenerase. \n \nTaking Agenerase with food and drink \nAgenerase capsules should be swallowed whole with water or another drink. They can be taken with \nor without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nInform your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon. The safe use of \nAgenerase in pregnancy has not been established. Ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking any \nmedicine. \n \nBreast feeding your baby is not recommended while you are taking Agenerase. It is recommended that \nHIV positive women do not breast feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects of Agenerase on the ability to drive and use machines have been done. If \nAgenerase makes you dizzy, do not operate any tools or machines. \n \nImportant information about ingredients of Agenerase capsules \nThese capsules contain glycerol, which can cause adverse effects in high doses. Glycerol can cause \nheadache, stomach upset and diarrhoea. \n \nThese capsules also contain sorbitol. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance \nto some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n92 \n\n \nBecause Agenerase capsules contain vitamin E, you should not take additional vitamin E supplements. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE AGENERASE  \n \nAlways take Agenerase exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nIf you need to take an antacid for indigestion, or if you are taking a drug containing an antacid (e.g. \ndidanosine), you are advised to take it more than an hour before or after Agenerase, otherwise the \neffects of Agenerase may be reduced. \n \n- Swallow Agenerase capsules whole with water or another drink. They can be taken with or \n\nwithout food. \n \n- Adults and adolescents (of 12 years of age and older), (greater than 50 kg body weight): the usual \n\ndose of Agenerase capsules is 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. If your doctor decides it is inappropriate \nfor you to take ritonavir, you will need to take increased doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice a \nday). \n\n \n- Children (4 to 12 years) and patients less than 50 kg body weight: the dose will be calculated \n\naccording to your weight by your doctor. The usual dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg for each \nkg of body weight, twice a day.. You should not take more than 2400 mg per day. \n \n\nIn some cases, your doctor may adapt the dose of Agenerase when other drugs are administered \nconcomitantly with Agenerase. \n \nTo derive the full benefit of Agenerase, it is very important that you take the full daily dose prescribed \nby your doctor. \n \nAn oral solution of Agenerase is available for children or adults unable to swallow capsules. \n \nIf you take more Agenerase than you should \nIf you have taken more than the prescribed dose of Agenerase, you should contact your doctor or \npharmacist immediately for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Agenerase \nIf you forget to take a dose of Agenerase, take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Agenerase \nYou must not stop taking Agenerase without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Agenerase can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the undesirable effects that \noccur are caused by Agenerase, by other medicines taken at the same time or by the HIV disease.

On rare occasions, these muscle \ndisorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat \ndistribution. These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen \n(belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck (‘buffalo \nhump’). The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. \nCombination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, \nhyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell \nyour doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them even if \n\ntheir symptoms are the same as yours. \n• If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1)  What Agenerase is and what it is used for  \n2)  Before you take Agenerase \n3)  How to take Agenerase \n4)  Possible side effects \n5)  How to store Agenerase \n6) Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT AGENERASE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAgenerase belongs to a group of antiviral medicines called protease inhibitors. These medicines are \nused for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n \nAgenerase is used in protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age \nof 4 years. Agenerase is prescribed for use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \nThe choice of Agenerase will be based on any resistance testing your doctor may have carried out and \nyour treatment history. \n \nThe benefit of Agenerase oral solution boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated either in \nprotease inhibitor naïve patients or protease inhibitor experienced patients. \n \nYou should take Agenerase capsules as soon as you are able to swallow them. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AGENERASE \n \nDo not take Agenerase \n-  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amprenavir or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nAgenerase. \n \n- you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may \nbe available without prescription) \n\n- pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia) \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems) \n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n- amiodarone, quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart beat) \n- triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and  / or relieve \n\nanxiety \n- bepridil (used to treat hypertension). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n97 \n\n-  if you are currently taking any  products containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as \nthis may stop Agenerase from working properly (see Taking/using other medicines). \n \nBecause of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient propylene glycol, \nAgenerase oral solution is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years, pregnant \nwomen, patients with hepatic impairment or failure, patients with renal failure, and patients treated \nwith disulfiram or metronidazole or preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir oral solution) or \nadditional propylene glycol (see also Take special care with Agenerase). \n \nTell your doctor if you have any of these listed conditions, or are taking any of the medicines listed \nabove. \n \nTake special care with Agenerase \nYou will need to take Agenerase every day. This medicine helps to control your condition, but it is not \na cure for HIV infection. You can still continue to develop other infections and other illnesses \nassociated with HIV disease. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. Do not stop taking \nyour medicine without first talking to your doctor. \n \nNo dosing recommendations can be made regarding the use of low dose ritonavir (normally used as an \nactivity booster with Agenerase capsules) together with Agenerase oral solution. Therefore this \ncombination must be avoided. \n \nAgenerase may interact with other medicines that you are taking, so it is important that you read the \nnext section  “Taking/using other medicines” before taking this medicine. \n \n\nAgenerase oral solution should be used with caution if you have limited liver enzyme activity, kidney \nimpairment or a genetically lower ability to metabolise alcohol  (e.g. Asian origin) due to adverse \nreactions that may be related to the propylene glycol in the solution. \n \nFor the same reason you must not take disulfiram or other medicines that reduce alcohol metabolism \n(e.g. metronidazole) or preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir oral solution) or additional \npropylene glycol while you are taking Agenerase oral solution (see also Do not take Agenerase). \n \nYour doctor may monitor you for adverse reactions potentially related to the propylene glycol content \nof the Agenerase oral solution, especially when you have renal or hepatic disease. It might also be \nnecessary to reconsider the treatment with Agenerase oral solution. \n \nYou should stop taking Agenerase oral solution as soon as you are able to swallow the Agenerase \ncapsules. \n \nYou should tell your doctor about any medical conditions that you have or have had.  \n \n- If you have had liver disease discuss this with your doctor. \n- Agenerase oral solution should not be used if you suffer from any liver disease. \n- Please speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and \npotentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function. \n\n- There have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia taking protease  \n- inhibitors. The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control \n\nbleeding. \n- Redistribution, accumulation or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy. Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n98 \n\n- In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, \nsigns and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s \nimmune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor. \n \nBone problems \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \nTreatment with Agenerase has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others \nby sexual contact or by blood transfer. You should continue to use appropriate precautions to prevent \nthis. \n \nTaking/using other medicines \nBefore starting treatment with Agenerase, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or \nhave recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is \nvery important, as taking some types of medicines at the same time as Agenerase can strengthen or \nweaken the effect of the medicines. This can sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  \n \nThere are some medicines that you must not take with Agenerase (please see ‘Do not take Agenerase’ \nfor further information). \n \nAgenerase may interact with certain other medicines. The use of the following medicines, together \nwith Agenerase, should only take place on the basis of medical advice: anaesthetics (e.g. lidocaine), \nantibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, clarithromycin, dapsone and erythromycin), antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, \nitraconazole), antimalarials (e.g. halofantrine), anticonvulsant medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, \nphenytoin and phenobarbital), calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, \nisradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil), cholesterol lowering \nmedicines (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin), erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil \nand vardenafil), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. delavirdine, efavirenz and \nnevirapine), opioids (e.g. methadone), hormones like oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. hormonal \ncontraceptives such as the ‘pill’), some glucocorticoids (e.g. fluticasone propionate and budesonide), \ntricyclic antidepressants (i.e. desipramine and nortriptyline), sedative agents (e.g. midazolam \nadministered by injection), paroxetine, and others (e.g. clozapine and loratadine). \n \nIf you are taking certain medicines that can cause serious side effects, such as carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, lidocaine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin, tricyclic antidepressants and \nwarfarin, at the same time as you are taking Agenerase, your doctor may carry out additional blood \ntests to minimise any potential safety problems. \n \nDue to the propylene glycol content of the oral solution you should not take disulfiram or other \nmedicines that reduce alcohol metabolism (e.g. metronidazole) or preparations that contain alcohol \n(e.g. ritonavir oral solution) or additional propylene glycol while you are taking Agenerase oral \nsolution (see Do not take Agenerase ). \n \nIf you are taking the contraceptive pill, it is recommended that you use an alternative method (e.g. a \ncondom) to prevent pregnancy, while you are taking Agenerase. The concomitant use of Agenerase \nand contraceptive pill may result in a decrease of the therapeutic effect of Agenerase. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n99 \n\nTaking Agenerase with food and drink \nAgenerase oral solution can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nInform your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant soon. The safe use of \nAgenerase in pregnancy has not been established. Ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking any \nmedicine. \n \nBreast feeding your baby is not recommended while you are taking Agenerase. It is recommended that \nHIV positive women do not breast feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects of Agenerase on the ability to drive and use machines have been done. If \nAgenerase makes you dizzy, do not operate any tools or machines. \n \nImportant information about ingredients of Agenerase oral solution \nThe oral solution contains propylene glycol, which can cause adverse effects in high doses. Propylene \nglycol can cause a range of adverse effects including seizures, stupor, rapid heart beat and the \nbreakdown of red blood cells (see also Do not take Agenerase, Take special care with Agenerase). \n \nThis medicinal product contains 4 mg sodium per ml. To be taken into consideration by patients on a \ncontrolled sodium diet, \n \nThis medicinal product also contains 1 mg potassium per ml. To be taken into consideration by \npatients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet, \n \nBecause Agenerase oral solution contains vitamin E, you should not take additional vitamin E \nsupplements. \n \n \n3.  HOW TO TAKE AGENERASE  \n \nAlways take Agenerase exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  Agenerase can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you need to take an antacid for indigestion, or if you are taking a drug containing an antacid (e.g. \ndidanosine), you are advised to take it more than an hour before or after Agenerase, otherwise the \neffects of Agenerase may be reduced. \n \n- Patients of 4 years of age and older unable to swallow capsules: The dose will be calculated \n\naccording to your weight by your doctor. The usual dose of Agenerase oral solution is 17 mg (1.1 \nml) for each kg of body weight three times a day.  You should not take more than 2800 mg per \nday. \n\n \nIn some cases, your doctor may adapt the dose of Agenerase when other drugs are administered \nconcomitantly with Agenerase. \n \nTo derive the full benefit of Agenerase, it is very important that you take the full daily dose prescribed \nby your doctor. \n \nA 20 ml measuring cup is provided, to help you measure out the correct amount of oral solution for \neach dose. \n \nIf you take more Agenerase than you should \nIf you have taken more than the prescribed dose of Agenerase, you should contact your doctor or \npharmacist immediately for advice. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n100 \n\nIf you forget to take Agenerase \nIf you forget to take a dose of Agenerase, take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Agenerase \nYou must not stop taking Agenerase without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Agenerase can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the undesirable effects that \noccur are caused by Agenerase, by other medicines taken at the same time or by the HIV disease. For \nthis reason, it is very important that you inform your doctor about any changes in your health. \n \nVery common side effects (these can affect more than 10 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Headache, feeling tired  \n• Diarrhoea, feeling sick, vomiting, flatulence \n• Skin Rashes (red, raised or itchy) – Occasionally, the skin rash may be svere and you may \n\nhave to stop taking this medicine. \n \nCommon side effects (these can affect 1 to 10 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Increases in triglycerides (a type of blood fat), changes in body shape because of fat \nredistribution,  \n\n• Moodiness, depression, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite \n• Tingling or numbness around the lips and mouth, uncontrolled movements \n• Pain, discomfort or excess acid in the stomach, loose stools,  \n• Increases in enzymes produced by the liver called transaminases, increases of an enzyme \n\nproduced by the pancreas called amylase \n \n\nUncommon side effects (these can affect less than 1 in 100 patients treated) \n \n\n• Increases in blood sugar or cholesterol (a type of blood fat) \n• Increases in the blood of a substance called bilirubin \n• Swelling of the face, lips and tongue (angioedema) \n \n\nRare side effects (these can affect 1 in 1,000 patients treated) \n \n\n• A severe or life-threatening skin reaction (Stevens Johnson syndrome) \n \nOther possible effects \n \nIn patients with haemophilia Type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \nprotease inhibitors. Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from your doctor. \n \nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with antiretroviral \ntherapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions, these muscle \ndisorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat \ndistribution. These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen \n(belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck (‘buffalo \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n101 \n\nhump’). The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. \nCombination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, \nhyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell \nyour doctor or pharmacist. \n \n5. HOW TO STORE AGENERASE \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not store above 25°C. \n \nDo not use Agenerase after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle and carton.  Discard \nAgenerase oral solution 15 days after first opening the bottle. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
