NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRanexa 375 mg prolonged-release tablets  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 375 mg of ranolazine.  \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet \nPale blue oval-shaped tablet engraved with 375 on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRanexa is indicated in adults as add-on therapy for the symptomatic treatment of patients with stable \nangina pectoris who are inadequately controlled or intolerant to first-line antianginal therapies (such as \nbeta-blockers and/or calcium antagonists).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nRanexa is available as 375 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg prolonged-release tablets.   \n \nAdults: The recommended initial dose of Ranexa is 375 mg twice daily. After 2–4 weeks, the dose \nshould be titrated to 500 mg twice daily and, according to the patient’s response, further titrated to a \nrecommended maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily (see section 5.1).  \n \nIf a patient experiences treatment-related adverse events (e.g. dizziness, nausea, or vomiting), down-\ntitration of Ranexa to 500 mg or 375 mg twice daily may be required. If symptoms do not resolve after \ndose reduction, treatment should be discontinued.   \n \nConcomitant treatment with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: Careful dose titration is \nrecommended in patients treated with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, fluconazole, \nerythromycin) or P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).   \n \nRenal impairment: Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 ml/min) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2). Ranexa is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Ranexa is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly: Dose titration in elderly patients should be exercised with caution (see section 4.4). Elderly \nmay have increased ranolazine exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function (see section 5.2). \nThe incidence of adverse events was higher in the elderly (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nLow weight: The incidence of adverse events was higher in patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg). Dose \ntitration in patients with low weight should be exercised with caution (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF): Dose titration in patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA \nClass III–IV) should be exercised with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ranexa in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available \n \nMethod of administration \nRanexa tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, broken, or chewed. They may be taken \nwith or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nModerate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, \nvoriconazol, posaconazol, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone) (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \nConcomitant administration of Class Ia (e.g. quinidine) or Class III (e.g. dofetilide, sotalol) \nantiarrhythmics other than amiodarone. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating ranolazine to patients in whom an \nincreased exposure is expected: \n\n• Concomitant administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n• Concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n• Mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n• Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 ml/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, \n\nand 5.2). \n• Elderly (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n• Patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n• Patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA Class III–IV) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \nIn patients with a combination of these factors, additional exposure increases are expected. Dose- \ndependent side effects are likely to occur. If Ranexa is used in patients with a combination of several \nof these factors, monitoring of adverse events should be frequent, the dose reduced, and treatment \ndiscontinued, if needed.  \n \nThe risk for increased exposure leading to adverse events in these different subgroups is higher in \npatients lacking CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers, PM) than subjects with CYP2D6 metabolising \ncapacity (extensive metabolisers, EM) (see section 5.2). The above precautions are based on the risk in \na CYP2D6 PM patient, and are needed when the CYP2D6 status is unknown. There is a lower need \nfor precautions in patients with CYP2D6 EM status. If the CYP2D6 status of the patient has been \ndetermined (e.g. by genotyping) or is previously known to be EM, Ranexa can be used with caution in \nthese patients when they have a combination of several of the above risk factors. \n \nQT prolongation: Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. A \npopulation-based analysis of combined data from patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated that \nthe slope of the plasma concentration-QTc relationship was estimated to be 2.4 msec per 1000 ng/ml, \nwhich is approximately equal to a 2- to 7-msec increase over the plasma concentration range for \nranolazine 500 to 1000 mg twice daily. Therefore, caution should be observed when treating patients \nwith a history of congenital or a family history of long QT syndrome, in patients with known acquired \n\n\n\n4 \n\nQT interval prolongation, and in patients treated with drugs affecting the QTc interval (see section 4.5 \nalso). \n \nDrug-drug interactions: Co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers is expected to lead to lack of \nefficacy. Ranexa should not be used in patients treated with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, \nphenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: Renal function decreases with age and it is therefore important to check renal \nfunction at regular intervals during treatment with ranolazine (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nSodium: This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per prolonged-release tablet, that is \nto say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on ranolazine \n \nCYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors: Ranolazine is a substrate of cytochrome CYP3A4. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 \nincrease plasma concentrations of ranolazine. The potential for dose-related adverse events (e.g. \nnausea, dizziness) may also increase with increased plasma concentrations. Concomitant treatment \nwith ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased the AUC of ranolazine by 3.0- to 3.9-fold during \nranolazine treatment. Combining ranolazine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, \nketoconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \nnefazodone) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Grapefruit juice is also a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.    \n \nDiltiazem (180 to 360 mg once daily), a moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, causes dose-dependent \nincreases in average ranolazine steady-state concentrations of 1.5- to 2.4-fold. Careful dose titration of \nRanexa is recommended in patients treated with diltiazem and other moderately potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, fluconazole). Down-titration of Ranexa may be required (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRanolazine is a substrate for P-gp. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. ciclosporin, verapamil) increase plasma \nlevels of ranolazine. Verapamil (120 mg three times daily) increases ranolazine steady-state \nconcentrations 2.2-fold. Careful dose titration of Ranexa is recommended in patients treated with \nP-gp inhibitors. Down-titration of Ranexa may be required (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inducers: Rifampicin (600 mg once daily) decreases ranolazine steady-state concentrations \nby approximately 95%. Initiation of treatment with Ranexa should be avoided during administration of \ninducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors: Ranolazine is partially metabolised by CYP2D6; therefore, inhibitors of this \nenzyme may increase plasma concentrations of ranolazine. The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine, \nat a dose of 20 mg once daily, increased steady-state plasma concentrations of ranolazine 1000 mg \ntwice daily by an average of 1.2-fold. No dose adjustment is required. At the dose level 500 mg twice \ndaily, co-administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 could result in an increase in ranolazine \nAUC of about 62%. \n \nEffects of ranolazine on other medicinal products \n \nRanolazine is a moderate to potent inhibitor of P-gp and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4, and may \nincrease plasma concentrations of P-gp or CYP3A4 substrates. Tissue distribution of drugs which are \ntransported by P-gp may be increased. \n \nDose adjustment of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin) and CYP3A4 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) may be required \nas RANEXA may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nAvailable data suggest that ranolazine is a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6. Ranexa 750 mg twice daily \nincreased plasma concentrations of metoprolol by 1.8-fold. Therefore the exposure to metoprolol or \nother CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. propafenone and flecainide or, to a lesser extent, tricyclic \nantidepressants and antipsychotics) may be increased during co-administration with Ranexa, and lower \ndoses of these medicinal products may be required. \n \nThe potential for inhibition of CYP2B6 has not been evaluated. Caution is advised during \nco-administration with CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz, cyclophosphamide). \n \nDigoxin: An increase in plasma digoxin concentrations by an average of 1.5-fold has been reported \nwhen Ranexa and digoxin are co-administered. Therefore, digoxin levels should be monitored \nfollowing initiation and termination of Ranexa therapy. \n \nSimvastatin: Simvastatin metabolism and clearance are highly dependent on CYP3A4. Ranexa \n1000 mg twice daily increased plasma concentrations of simvastatin lactone, simvastatin acid by about \n2 fold. Rhabdomyolysis has been associated with high doses of simvastatin and cases of \nrhabdomyolysis have been observed in patients receiving Ranexa and simvastatin, in postmarketing \nexperience. Limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg once daily in patients taking any dose of Ranexa.  \n \nAtorvastatin: Ranexa 1000 mg twice daily increased Cmax and AUC of atorvastatin 80 mg once daily \nby 1.4- and 1.3 -fold, respectively and changed the Cmax and AUC of atorvastatin metabolites less \nthan 35%. Dose limitation of atorvastatin and appropriate clinical monitoring may be considered when \ntaking Ranexa. \n \nDose limitation of other statins, metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. lovastatin), may be considered when \ntaking Ranexa. \n \nTacrolimus, ciclosporin, sirolimus, everolimus: Increased plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, a \nCYP3A4 substrate, have been observed in patients after ranolazine administration. It is recommended \nthat tacrolimus blood levels are monitored when co-administering Ranexa and tacrolimus and that \ntacrolimus dosage is adjusted accordingly. This is also recommended for other CYP3A4 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., ciclosporin, sirolimus, everolimus). \n \nDrugs transported by the Organic Cation Transporter-2 (OCT2): Plasma exposure of metformin \n(1000 mg twice daily) increased 1.4- and 1.8-fold in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus when co-\nadministered with RANEXA 500 mg and 1000 mg twice daily respectively. The exposure of other \nOCT2 substrates, including but not limited to pindolol and varenicline, may be affected to a similar \ndegree. \n \nThere is a theoretical risk that concomitant treatment of ranolazine with other drugs known to prolong \nthe QTc interval may give rise to a pharmacodynamic interaction and increase the possible risk of \nventricular arrhythmias. Examples of such drugs include certain antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, \nastemizole, mizolastine), certain antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), \nerythromycin, and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, doxepin, amitriptyline). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: There are limited amount of data from the use of ranolazine in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals showed embryo toxicity (see Section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Ranexa \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding: It is unknown whether ranolazine is excreted in human breast milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of ranolazine in milk (for details \nsee Section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Ranexa should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFertility: In animals, reproduction studies indicated no adverse effects on fertility (see section 5.3). \nThe effect of ranolazine on human fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Ranexa on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nRanexa may cause dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, confusional state, coordination abnormal, \nhallucination (see section 4.8), which may affect the ability to drive and use machines.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nUndesirable effects in patients receiving Ranexa are generally mild to moderate in severity and often \ndevelop within the first 2 weeks of treatment. These were reported during the Phase 3 clinical \ndevelopment programme, which included a total of 1,030 chronic angina patients treated with Ranexa.   \n \nThe adverse events, considered to be at least possibly related to treatment, are listed below by body \nsystem, organ class, and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and \nvery rare (< 1/10,000).  \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon: anorexia, decreased appetite, dehydration. \nRare: hyponatremia \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: anxiety, insomnia, confusional state, hallucination. \nRare: disorientation. \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, headache. \nUncommon: lethargy, syncope, hypoaesthesia, somnolence, tremor, postural dizziness, paresthesia. \nRare: amnesia, depressed level of consciousness, loss of consciousness, coordination abnormal, gait \n\ndisturbance, parosmia. \n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: blurred vision, visual disturbance, diplopia.  \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: vertigo, tinnitus. \nRare: impaired hearing.  \n \nVascular disorders  \nUncommon: hot flush, hypotension. \nRare: peripheral coldness, orthostatic hypotension.  \n \nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: dyspnoea, cough, epistaxis. \nRare: throat tightness. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: constipation, vomiting, nausea. \nUncommon: abdominal pain, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence, stomach discomfort.  \nRare: pancreatitis, erosive duodenitis, oral hypoaesthesia.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: pruritus, hyperhydrosis. \nRare: angioedema, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, cold sweat, rash. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: pain in extremity, muscle cramp, joint swelling, muscular weakness.  \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: dysuria, haematuria, chromaturia. \nRare: acute renal failure, urinary retention. \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nRare: erectile dysfunction. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: asthenia. \nUncommon: fatigue, peripheral oedema. \n \nInvestigations \nUncommon: increased blood creatinine, increased blood urea, prolonged QT corrected interval, \n\nincreased platelet or white blood cell count, decreased weight. \nRare: elevated levels of hepatic enzyme. \n \nThe adverse event profile was generally similar in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study. In this long term \nstudy, acute renal failure was also reported with an incidence less than 1% in placebo and ranolazine \npatients. Evaluations in patients who may be considered at higher risk of adverse events when treated \nwith other antianginal medicinal products, e.g. patients with diabetes, Class I and II heart failure, or \nobstructive airway disease, confirmed that these conditions were not associated with clinically \nmeaningful increases in the incidence of adverse events.  \n \nAn increased incidence of adverse events was seen among ranolazine treated patients in the RIVER-\nPCI trial (see section 5.1) where patients with incomplete revascularization post-PCI were given \nranolazine up to 1000 mg twice daily or placebo for approximately 70 weeks. In this study, there was a \nhigher reporting rate for congestive heart failure in the ranolazine group (2.2% vs 1.0% in placebo). \nAlso, transient ischemic attack occurred more frequently in patients treated with ranolazine 1000 mg \ntwice daily compared with placebo (1.0% vs 0.2%, respectively); however, the incidence of stroke was \nsimilar between treatment groups (ranolazine 1.7% vs placebo 1.5%). \n \nElderly, renal impairment, and low weight: In general, adverse events occurred more frequently \namong elderly patients and patients with renal impairment; however, the types of events in these \nsubgroups were similar to those observed in the general population. Of the most commonly reported, \nthe following events occurred more often with Ranexa (placebo-corrected frequencies) in elderly \n(≥ 75 years of age) than younger patients (< 75 years of age): constipation (8% versus 5%), nausea \n(6% versus 3%), hypotension (5% versus 1%), and vomiting (4% versus 1%).   \n \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30–80 ml/min) compared \nto those with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), the most commonly reported \nevents and their placebo-corrected frequencies included: constipation (8% versus 4%), dizziness (7% \nversus 5%), and nausea (4% versus 2%).  \n \nIn general, the type and frequency of adverse events reported in patients with low body weight \n(≤ 60 kg) were similar to those of patients with higher weight (> 60 kg); however, the placebo-\ncorrected frequencies of the following common adverse events were higher in low body weight than \nheavier patients: nausea (14% versus 2%), vomiting (6% versus 1%), and hypotension (4% versus \n2%).  \n \nLaboratory findings: Small, clinically insignificant, reversible elevations in serum creatinine levels \nhave been observed in healthy subjects and patients treated with Ranexa. There was no renal toxicity \nrelated to these findings. A renal function study in healthy volunteers demonstrated a reduction in \n\n\n\n8 \n\ncreatinine clearance with no change in glomerular filtration rate consistent with inhibition of renal \ntubular secretion of creatinine.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn an oral high-dose tolerability study in angina patients, the incidence of dizziness, nausea, and \nvomiting increased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to these adverse events, diplopia, \nlethargy, and syncope were observed in an intravenous overdose study in healthy volunteers. In the \nevent of overdose, the patient should be closely monitored and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive.  \n\n \nApproximately 62% of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, complete clearance by \nhaemodialysis is unlikely. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB18 \n \nMechanism of action: The mechanism of action of ranolazine is largely unknown. Ranolazine may \nhave some antianginal effects by inhibition of the late sodium current in cardiac cells. This reduces \nintracellular sodium accumulation and consequently decreases intracellular calcium overload. \nRanolazine, via its action to decrease the late sodium current, is considered to reduce these \nintracellular ionic imbalances during ischaemia. This reduction in cellular calcium overload is \nexpected to improve myocardial relaxation and thereby decrease left ventricular diastolic stiffness. \nClinical evidence of inhibition of the late sodium current by ranolazine is provided by a significant \nshortening of the QTc interval and an improvement in diastolic relaxation in an open-label study of \n5 patients with a long QT syndrome (LQT3 having the SCN5A ∆KPQ gene mutation). \n \nThese effects do not depend upon changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or vasodilation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nHaemodynamic effects: Minimal decreases in mean heart rate (< 2 beats per minute) and mean \nsystolic blood pressure (< 3 mm Hg) were observed in patients treated with ranolazine either alone or \nin combination with other antianginal medicinal products in controlled studies. \n \nElectrocardiographic effects: Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval \n(about 6 msec at 1000 mg twice daily), reductions in T wave amplitude, and in some cases notched \nT waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranexa. These effects of ranolazine on the \nsurface electrocardiogram are believed to result from inhibition of the fast-rectifying potassium \ncurrent, which prolongs the ventricular action potential, and from inhibition of the late sodium current, \nwhich shortens the ventricular action potential. A population analysis of combined data from \n1,308 patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated a mean increase in QTc from baseline of 2.4 msec \nper 1000 ng/ml ranolazine plasma concentration. This value is consistent with data from pivotal \nclinical studies, where mean changes from baseline in QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) after doses of \n500 and 750 mg twice daily were 1.9 and 4.9 msec, respectively. The slope is higher in patients with \nclinically significant hepatic impairment.   \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS, there was no \ndifference between Ranexa and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk \nranolazine:placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac death (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.87), or the \nfrequency of symptomatic documented arrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%). \n  \nNo proarrhythmic effects were observed in 3,162 patients treated with Ranexa based on 7-day Holter \nmonitoring in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias \nin patients treated with Ranexa (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \n≥ 8 beats (5% versus 8%). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety: Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Ranexa in \nthe treatment of patients with chronic angina, either alone or when the benefit from other antianginal \nmedicinal products was sub-optimal. \n \nIn the pivotal study, CARISA, Ranexa was added to treatment with atenolol 50 mg once daily, \namlodipine 5 mg once daily, or diltiazem 180 mg once daily. Eight-hundred and twenty-three patients \n(23% women) were randomised to receive 12 weeks of treatment with Ranexa 750 mg twice daily, \n1000 mg twice daily, or placebo. Ranexa demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in prolonging \nexercise time at trough at 12 weeks for both doses studied when used as an add-on therapy. However, \nthere was no difference in exercise duration between the two doses (24 seconds compared to placebo; \np ≤ 0.03).  \n \nRanexa resulted in significant decreases in the number of angina attacks per week and consumption of \nshort-acting nitroglycerin compared to placebo. Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop during \ntreatment and a rebound increase in angina attacks was not observed following abrupt discontinuation. \nThe improvement in exercise duration in women was about 33% of the improvement in men at the \n1000 mg twice-daily dose level. However, men and women had similar reductions in frequency of \nangina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption. Given the dose-dependent side effects and similar \nefficacy at 750 and 1000 mg twice daily, a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily is recommended.  \n \nIn a second study, ERICA, Ranexa was added to treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily (the \nmaximum labelled dose). Five-hundred and sixty-five patients were randomised to receive an initial \ndose of Ranexa 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with \nRanexa 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg \nonce daily. Additionally, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Ranexa \nresulted in significant decreases in the number of angina attacks per week (p = 0.028) and \nconsumption of short-acting nitroglycerin (p = 0.014) compared to placebo. Both the average number \nof angina attacks and nitroglycerin tablets consumed decreased by approximately one per week.   \n \nIn the main dose-finding study, MARISA, ranolazine was used as monotherapy. One-hundred and \nninety-one patients were randomised to treatment with Ranexa 500 mg twice daily, 1000 mg twice \ndaily, 1500 mg twice daily, and matching placebo, each for 1 week in a crossover design. Ranexa was \nsignificantly superior to placebo in prolonging exercise time, time to angina, and time to 1 mm ST \nsegment depression at all doses studied with an observed dose-response relationship. Improvement of \nexercise duration was statistically significant compared to placebo for all three doses of ranolazine \nfrom 24 seconds at 500 mg twice daily to 46 seconds at 1500 mg twice daily, showing a dose-related \nresponse. In this study, exercise duration was longest in the 1500 mg group; however, there was a \ndisproportional increase in side effects, and the 1500 mg dose was not studied further.   \n \nIn a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS, there was no \ndifference in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac \ndeath (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.87), or the frequency of symptomatic documented \narrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%) between Ranexa and placebo when added to standard medical therapy \n(including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, anti-platelet agents, lipid-lowering \nmedicinal products, and ACE inhibitors). Approximately one-half of the patients in MERLIN-TIMI 36 \nhad a history of angina. The results showed that exercise duration was 31 seconds longer in ranolazine \npatients versus placebo patients (p = 0.002). The Seattle Angina Questionnaire showed significant \n\n\n\n10 \n\neffects on several dimensions, including angina frequency (p < 0.001), compared to placebo-treated \npatients.   \n \nA small proportion of non-Caucasians was included in the controlled clinical studies; therefore, no \nconclusions can be drawn regarding the effect and safety in non-Caucasians. \n \nIn a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial (RIVER-PCI) in 2604 patients aged \n≥18 years with a history of chronic angina and incomplete revascularisation after percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI) patients were up-titrated to 1000 mg twice daily (dosage not approved in \nthe current SmPC). No significant difference occurred in the composite primary endpoint (time to first \noccurrence of ischaemia-driven revascularisation or ischaemia-driven hospitalisation without \nrevascularisation) in the ranolazine group (26.2%) versus the placebo group (28.3%), hazard ratio \n0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.10 p= 0.48. The risk of all cause mortality, CV death or major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE) and heart failure hospitalisation was similar between treatment groups \nin the overall population; however, MACE were reported more frequently in patients ≥ 75 years \ntreated with ranolazine compared with placebo (17.0% vs 11.3%, respectively); in addition there was a \nnumerical increase in all cause mortality in patients ≥ 75 years (9.2% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.074). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration of Ranexa, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically observed between \n2 and 6 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing. \n \nAbsorption: The mean absolute bioavailability of ranolazine after oral administration of immediate-\nrelease ranolazine tablets ranged from 35−50%, with large inter-individual variability. Ranexa \nexposure increases more than in proportion to dose. There was a 2.5- to 3-fold increase in steady-state \nAUC as the dose was increased from 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily. In a pharmacokinetic study in \nhealthy volunteers, steady-state Cmax was, on average, approximately 1770 (SD 1040) ng/ml, and \nsteady-state AUC0-12 was, on average, 13,700 (SD 8290) ng x h/ml following a dose of 500 mg twice \ndaily. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption of ranolazine. \n \nDistribution: Approximately 62% of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins, mainly alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein and weakly to albumin. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is about 180 l. \n \nElimination: Ranolazine is eliminated primarily by metabolism. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted \nunchanged in the urine and faeces. Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose of \n[14C]-ranolazine to healthy subjects, 73% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 25% in \nfaeces. \n \nClearance of ranolazine is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose. The elimination half-life is \nabout 2−3 hours after intravenous administration. The terminal half-life at steady state after oral \nadministration of ranolazine is about 7 hours, due to the absorption rate-limited elimination. \n \nBiotransformation: Ranolazine undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, \nranolazine accounts for approximately 13% of the radioactivity in plasma following a single oral \n500 mg dose of [14C]-ranolazine. A large number of metabolites has been identified in human plasma \n(47 metabolites), urine (> 100 metabolites), and faeces (25 metabolites). Fourteen primary pathways \nhave been identified of which O-demethylation and N-dealkylation are the most important. In vitro \nstudies using human liver microsomes indicate that ranolazine is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4, \nbut also by CYP2D6. At 500 mg twice daily, subjects lacking CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers, \nPM) had 62% higher AUC than subjects with CYP2D6 metabolising capacity (extensive metabolisers, \nEM). The corresponding difference at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose was 25%. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe influence of various factors on the pharmacokinetics of ranolazine was assessed in a population \npharmacokinetic evaluation in 928 angina patients and healthy subjects. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nGender effects: Gender had no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters. \n \nElderly patients: Age alone had no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters.  \nHowever, the elderly may have increased ranolazine exposure due to age-related decrease in renal \nfunction. \n \nBody weight: Compared to subjects weighing 70 kg, exposure was estimated to be about 1.4-fold \nhigher in subjects weighing 40 kg.   \n \nCHF: CHF NYHA Class III and IV were estimated to have about 1.3-fold higher plasma \nconcentrations.   \n \nRenal impairment: In a study evaluating the influence of renal function on ranolazine \npharmacokinetics, ranolazine AUC was on average 1.7- to 2-fold higher in subjects with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. There was \na large inter-individual variability in AUC in subjects with renal impairment. The AUC of metabolites \nincreased with decreased renal function. The AUC of one pharmacologically active ranolazine \nmetabolite was 5-fold increased in patients with severe renal impairment.   \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis, a 1.2-fold increase in ranolazine exposure was estimated \nin subjects with moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 40 ml/min). In subjects with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 ml/min), a 1.3- to 1.8-fold increase in ranolazine exposure \nwas estimated.   \n \nThe influence of dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been evaluated.  \n \nHepatic impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine have been evaluated in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nRanolazine AUC was unaffected in patients with mild hepatic impairment but increased 1.8-fold in \npatients with moderate impairment. QT prolongation was more pronounced in these patients.   \n \nPaediatric population: The pharmacokinetic parameters of ranolazine have not been studied in the \npaediatric population (< 18 years). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at levels similar to clinical \nexposure, were as follows: Ranolazine was associated with convulsions and increased mortality in rats \nand dogs at plasma concentrations approximately 3-fold higher than at the proposed maximum clinical \ndose.  \n \nChronic toxicity studies in rats indicated that treatment was associated with adrenal changes at \nexposures slightly greater than those seen in clinical patients. This effect is associated with increased \nplasma cholesterol concentrations. No similar changes have been identified in humans. No effect on \nthe adreno-cortical axis was noted in humans. \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies at doses of ranolazine up to 50 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m2/day) in \nmice and 150 mg/kg/day (900 mg/m2/day) in rats, no relevant increases in the incidence of any tumour \ntypes were seen. These doses are equivalent to 0.1 and 0.8 times, respectively, the maximum \nrecommended human dose of 2 grams on a mg/m2 basis, and represent the maximum tolerated doses in \nthese species. \n \nIn male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) 3.6-fold or \n6.6-fold higher than expected in humans, respectively, had no effect on fertility. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nEmbryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits: no effect were noted in rabbit fetuses \nwhen mothers were exposed at levels (AUC) of plasma ranolazine similar to expected human levels. \nIn rats, no effects in fetuses was noted when mothers were exposed to 2-fold greater levels (AUC) than \nexpected in humans, whereas decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed when the \nexposure of mothers was 7.5-fold than those obtained in humans. Post-natal mortality of pups was not \nrecorded when the exposure of nursing mothers was 1.3 fold higher than in expected humans, whereas \nat 3-fold higher exposure post-natal mortality was recorded, concomitant with evidence of milk \nexcretion of ranolazine in rats. No adverse effects on newborn rats were observed at levels of \nexposures similar to those observed in humans. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 500 mg of ranolazine.  \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet \nLight orange oval-shaped tablet engraved with 500 on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRanexa is indicated in adults as add-on therapy for the symptomatic treatment of patients with stable \nangina pectoris who are inadequately controlled or intolerant to first-line antianginal therapies (such as \nbeta-blockers and/or calcium antagonists).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nRanexa is available as 375 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg prolonged-release tablets.   \n \nAdults: The recommended initial dose of Ranexa is 375 mg twice daily. After 2–4 weeks, the dose \nshould be titrated to 500 mg twice daily and, according to the patient’s response, further titrated to a \nrecommended maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily (see section 5.1).  \n \nIf a patient experiences treatment-related adverse events (e.g. dizziness, nausea, or vomiting), down-\ntitration of Ranexa to 500 mg or 375 mg twice daily may be required. If symptoms do not resolve after \ndose reduction, treatment should be discontinued.   \n \nConcomitant treatment with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: Careful dose titration is \nrecommended in patients treated with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, fluconazole, \nerythromycin) or P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).     \n \nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).   \n \nRenal impairment: Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 ml/min) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2). Ranexa is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Ranexa is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly: Dose titration in elderly patients should be exercised with caution (see section 4.4). Elderly \nmay have increased ranolazine exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function (see section 5.2). \nThe incidence of adverse events was higher in the elderly (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nLow weight: The incidence of adverse events was higher in patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg). Dose \ntitration in patients with low weight should be exercised with caution (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF): Dose titration in patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA \nClass III–IV) should be exercised with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Ranexa in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRanexa tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, broken, or chewed. They may be taken \nwith or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nModerate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, \nvoriconazol, posaconazol, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone) (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \nConcomitant administration of Class Ia (e.g. quinidine) or Class III (e.g. dofetilide, sotalol) \nantiarrhythmics other than amiodarone. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating ranolazine to patients in whom an \nincreased exposure is expected: \n\n• Concomitant administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n• Concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n• Mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n• Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 ml/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, \n\nand 5.2). \n• Elderly (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n• Patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n• Patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA Class III–IV) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).    \n\n \nIn patients with a combination of these factors, additional exposure increases are expected. Dose- \ndependent side effects are likely to occur. If Ranexa is used in patients with a combination of several \nof these factors, monitoring of adverse events should be frequent, the dose reduced, and treatment \ndiscontinued, if needed.  \n \nThe risk for increased exposure leading to adverse events in these different subgroups is higher in \npatients lacking CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers, PM) than subjects with CYP2D6 metabolising \ncapacity (extensive metabolisers, EM) (see section 5.2). The above precautions are based on the risk in \na CYP2D6 PM patient, and are needed when the CYP2D6 status is unknown. There is a lower need \nfor precautions in patients with CYP2D6 EM status. If the CYP2D6 status of the patient has been \ndetermined (e.g. by genotyping) or is previously known to be EM, Ranexa can be used with caution in \nthese patients when they have a combination of several of the above risk factors. \n \nQT prolongation: Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner.  A \npopulation-based analysis of combined data from patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated that \nthe slope of the plasma concentration-QTc relationship was estimated to be 2.4 msec per 1000 ng/ml, \nwhich is approximately equal to a 2- to 7-msec increase over the plasma concentration range for \n\n\n\n16 \n\nranolazine 500 to 1000 mg twice daily. Therefore, caution should be observed when treating patients \nwith a history of congenital or a family history of long QT syndrome, in patients with known acquired \nQT interval prolongation, and in patients treated with drugs affecting the QTc interval (see section 4.5 \nalso). \n \nDrug-drug interactions: Co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers is expected to lead to lack of \nefficacy. Ranexa should not be used in patients treated with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, \nphenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: Renal function decreases with age and it is therefore important to check renal \nfunction at regular intervals during treatment with ranolazine (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8, and 5.2).  \n \nSodium: This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per prolonged-release tablet, that is \nto say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on ranolazine \n \nCYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors: Ranolazine is a substrate of cytochrome CYP3A4. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 \nincrease plasma concentrations of ranolazine. The potential for dose-related adverse events (e.g. \nnausea, dizziness) may also increase with increased plasma concentrations. Concomitant treatment \nwith ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased the AUC of ranolazine by 3.0- to 3.9-fold during \nranolazine treatment. Combining ranolazine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, \nketoconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \nnefazodone) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Grapefruit juice is also a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.    \n \nDiltiazem (180 to 360 mg once daily), a moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, causes dose-dependent \nincreases in average ranolazine steady-state concentrations of 1.5- to 2.4-fold. Careful dose titration of \nRanexa is recommended in patients treated with diltiazem and other moderately potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, fluconazole). Down-titration of Ranexa may be required (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRanolazine is a substrate for P-gp. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. ciclosporin, verapamil) increase plasma \nlevels of ranolazine. Verapamil (120 mg three times daily) increases ranolazine steady-state \nconcentrations 2.2-fold. Careful dose titration of Ranexa is recommended in patients treated with P-gp \ninhibitors. Down-titration of Ranexa may be required (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inducers: Rifampicin (600 mg once daily) decreases ranolazine steady-state concentrations \nby approximately 95%. Initiation of treatment with Ranexa should be avoided during administration of \ninducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors: Ranolazine is partially metabolised by CYP2D6; therefore, inhibitors of this \nenzyme may increase plasma concentrations of ranolazine. The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine, \nat a dose of 20 mg once daily, increased steady-state plasma concentrations of ranolazine 1000 mg \ntwice daily by an average of 1.2-fold. No dose adjustment is required. At the dose level 500 mg twice \ndaily, co-administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 could result in an increase in ranolazine \nAUC of about 62%. \n \nEffects of ranolazine on other medicinal products \n \nRanolazine is a moderate to potent inhibitor of P-gp and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4, and may \nincrease plasma concentrations of P-gp or CYP3A4 substrates. Tissue distribution of drugs which are \ntransported by P-gp may be increased.   \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nDose adjustment of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin) and CYP3A4 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) may be required \nas RANEXA may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that ranolazine is a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6. Ranexa 750 mg twice daily \nincreased plasma concentrations of metoprolol by 1.8-fold. Therefore the exposure to metoprolol or \nother CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. propafenone and flecainide or, to a lesser extent, tricyclic \nantidepressants and antipsychotics) may be increased during co-administration with Ranexa, and lower \ndoses of these medicinal products may be required. \n \nThe potential for inhibition of CYP2B6 has not been evaluated. Caution is advised during \nco-administration with CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz, cyclophosphamide). \n \nDigoxin: An increase in plasma digoxin concentrations by an average of 1.5-fold has been reported \nwhen Ranexa and digoxin are co-administered. Therefore, digoxin levels should be monitored \nfollowing initiation and termination of Ranexa therapy. \n \nSimvastatin: Simvastatin metabolism and clearance are highly dependent on CYP3A4. Ranexa \n1000 mg twice daily increased plasma concentrations of simvastatin lactone, simvastatin acidby about \n2-fold. Rhabdomyolysis has been associated with high doses of simvastatin and cases of \nrhabdomyolysis have been observed in patients receiving Ranexa and simvastatin, in postmarketing \nexperience. Limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg once daily in patients taking any dose of Ranexa.  \n \nAtorvastatin: Ranexa 1000 mg twice daily increased Cmax and AUC of atorvastatin 80 mg once daily \nby 1.4- and 1.3 -fold, respectively and changed the Cmax and AUC of atorvastatin metabolites less \nthan 35%. Dose limitation of atorvastatin and appropriate clinical monitoring may be considered when \ntaking Ranexa. \n \nDose limitation of other statins, metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. lovastatin), may be considered when \ntaking Ranexa. \n \nTacrolimus, ciclosporin, sirolimus, everolimus: Increased plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, a \nCYP3A4 substrate, have been observed in patients after ranolazine administration. It is recommended \nthat tacrolimus blood levels are monitored when co-administering Ranexa and tacrolimus and that \ntacrolimus dosage is adjusted accordingly. This is also recommended for other CYP3A4 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., ciclosporin, sirolimus, everolimus). \n \nDrugs transported by the Organic Cation Transporter-2 (OCT2): Plasma exposure of metformin \n(1000 mg twice daily) increased 1.4- and 1.8-fold in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus when co-\nadministered with RANEXA 500 mg and 1000 mg twice daily respectively. The exposure of other \nOCT2 substrates, including but not limited to pindolol and varenicline, may be affected to a similar \ndegree. \n \nThere is a theoretical risk that concomitant treatment of ranolazine with other drugs known to prolong \nthe QTc interval may give rise to a pharmacodynamic interaction and increase the possible risk of \nventricular arrhythmias. Examples of such drugs include certain antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, \nastemizole, mizolastine), certain antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), \nerythromycin, and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, doxepin, amitriptyline). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: There are limited amount of data from the use of ranolazine in pregnant women Studies in \nanimals showed embryo toxicity (see Section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Ranexa \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding: It is unknown whether ranolazine is excreted in human breast milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of ranolazine in milk (for details \n\n\n\n18 \n\nsee Section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Ranexa should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility: In animals, reproduction studies indicated no adverse effects on fertility (see section 5.3). \nThe effect of ranolazine on human fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Ranexa on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nRanexa may cause dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, confusional state, coordination abnormal, and \nhallucination (see section 4.8), which may affect the ability to drive and use machines.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nUndesirable effects in patients receiving Ranexa are generally mild to moderate in severity and often \ndevelop within the first 2 weeks of treatment. These were reported during the Phase 3 clinical \ndevelopment programme, which included a total of 1,030 chronic angina patients treated with Ranexa.   \n \nThe adverse events, considered to be at least possibly related to treatment, are listed below by body \nsystem, organ class, and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and \nvery rare (< 1/10,000).  \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon: anorexia, decreased appetite, dehydration. \nRare: hyponatremia \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: anxiety, insomnia, confusional state, hallucination. \nRare: disorientation. \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, headache. \nUncommon: lethargy, syncope, hypoaesthesia, somnolence, tremor, postural dizziness, paresthesia. \nRare: amnesia, depressed level of consciousness, loss of consciousness, coordination abnormal, gait \n\ndisturbance, parosmia. \n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: blurred vision, visual disturbance, diplpopia.  \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: vertigo, tinnitus. \nRare: impaired hearing.  \n \nVascular disorders  \nUncommon: hot flush, hypotension. \nRare: peripheral coldness, orthostatic hypotension.  \n \nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: dyspnoea, cough, epistaxis. \nRare: throat tightness. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: constipation, vomiting, nausea. \nUncommon: abdominal pain, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence, stomach discomfort.  \nRare: pancreatitis, erosive duodenitis, oral hypoaesthesia.  \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: pruritus, hyperhydrosis. \nRare: angioedema,  allergic dermatitis, urticaria, cold sweat, rash. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: pain in extremity, muscle cramp, joint swelling, muscular weakness.  \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: dysuria, haematuria, chromaturia. \nRare: acute renal failure, urinary retention. \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nRare: erectile dysfunction. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: asthenia. \nUncommon: fatigue, peripheral oedema. \n \nInvestigations \nUncommon: increased blood creatinine, increased blood urea, prolonged QT corrected interval, \n\nincreased platelet or white blood cell count, decreased weight. \nRare: elevated levels of hepatic enzyme. \n \nThe adverse event profile was generally similar in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study. In this long term \nstudy, acute renal failure was also reported with an incidence less than 1% in placebo and ranolazine \npatients. Evaluations in patients who may be considered at higher risk of adverse events when treated \nwith other antianginal medicinal products, e.g. patients with diabetes, Class I and II heart failure, or \nobstructive airway disease, confirmed that these conditions were not associated with clinically \nmeaningful increases in the incidence of adverse events. \n \nAn increased incidence of adverse events was seen among ranolazine treated patients in the RIVER-\nPCI trial (see section 5.1) where patients with incomplete revascularization post-PCI were given \nranolazine up to 1000 mg twice daily or placebo for approximately 70 weeks. In this study, there was a \nhigher reporting rate for congestive heart failure in the ranolazine group (2.2% vs 1.0% in placebo). \nAlso, transient ischemic attack occurred more frequently in patients treated with ranolazine 1000 mg \ntwice daily compared with placebo (1.0% vs 0.2%, respectively); however, the incidence of stroke was \nsimilar between treatment groups (ranolazine 1.7% vs placebo 1.5%). \n \nElderly, renal impairment, and low weight: In general, adverse events occurred more frequently \namong elderly patients and patients with renal impairment; however, the types of events in these \nsubgroups were similar to those observed in the general population. Of the most commonly reported, \nthe following events occurred more often with Ranexa (placebo-corrected frequencies) in elderly \n(≥ 75 years of age) than younger patients (< 75 years of age): constipation (8% versus 5%), nausea \n(6% versus 3%), hypotension (5% versus 1%), and vomiting (4% versus 1%).   \n \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30–80 ml/min) compared \nto those with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), the most commonly reported \nevents and their placebo-corrected frequencies included: constipation (8% versus 4%), dizziness (7% \nversus 5%), and nausea (4% versus 2%).  \n \nIn general, the type and frequency of adverse events reported in patients with low body weight \n(≤ 60 kg) were similar to those of patients with higher weight (> 60 kg); however, the placebo-\ncorrected frequencies of the following common adverse events were higher in low body weight than \nheavier patients: nausea (14% versus 2%), vomiting (6% versus 1%), and hypotension (4% versus \n2%).  \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nLaboratory findings: Small, clinically insignificant, reversible elevations in serum creatinine levels \nhave been observed in healthy subjects and patients treated with Ranexa. There was no renal toxicity \nrelated to these findings. A renal function study in healthy volunteers demonstrated a reduction in \ncreatinine clearance with no change in glomerular filtration rate consistent with inhibition of renal \ntubular secretion of creatinine.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn an oral high-dose tolerability study in angina patients, the incidence of dizziness, nausea, and \nvomiting increased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to these adverse events, diplopia, \nlethargy, and syncope were observed in an intravenous overdose study in healthy volunteers. In the \nevent of overdose, the patient should be closely monitored and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive.  \n\n \nApproximately 62% of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, complete clearance by \nhaemodialysis is unlikely. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB18 \n \nMechanism of action: The mechanism of action of ranolazine is largely unknown. Ranolazine may \nhave some antianginal effects by inhibition of the late sodium current in cardiac cells. This reduces \nintracellular sodium accumulation and consequently decreases intracellular calcium overload. \nRanolazine, via its action to decrease the late sodium current, is considered to reduce these \nintracellular ionic imbalances during ischaemia. This reduction in cellular calcium overload is \nexpected to improve myocardial relaxation and thereby decrease left ventricular diastolic stiffness. \nClinical evidence of inhibition of the late sodium current by ranolazine is provided by a significant \nshortening of the QTc interval and an improvement in diastolic relaxation in an open-label study of \n5 patients with a long QT syndrome (LQT3 having the SCN5A ∆KPQ gene mutation). \n \nThese effects do not depend upon changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or vasodilation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nHaemodynamic effects: Minimal decreases in mean heart rate (< 2 beats per minute) and mean \nsystolic blood pressure (< 3 mm Hg) were observed in patients treated with ranolazine either alone or \nin combination with other antianginal medicinal products in controlled studies. \n \nElectrocardiographic effects: Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval \n(about 6 msec at 1000 mg twice daily), reductions in T wave amplitude, and in some cases notched \nT waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranexa. These effects of ranolazine on the \nsurface electrocardiogram are believed to result from inhibition of the fast-rectifying potassium \ncurrent, which prolongs the ventricular action potential, and from inhibition of the late sodium current, \nwhich shortens the ventricular action potential. A population analysis of combined data from \n1,308 patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated a mean increase in QTc from baseline of 2.4 msec \nper 1000 ng/ml ranolazine plasma concentration. This value is consistent with data from pivotal \nclinical studies, where mean changes from baseline in QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) after doses of \n\n\n\n21 \n\n500 and 750 mg twice daily were 1.9 and 4.9 msec, respectively. The slope is higher in patients with \nclinically significant hepatic impairment.   \n \nIn a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS, there was no \ndifference between Ranexa and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk \nranolazine:placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac death (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.87), or the \nfrequency of symptomatic documented arrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%). \n  \nNo proarrhythmic effects were observed in 3,162 patients treated with Ranexa based on 7-day Holter \nmonitoring in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias \nin patients treated with Ranexa (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \n≥ 8 beats (5% versus 8%). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety: Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Ranexa in \nthe treatment of patients with chronic angina, either alone or when the benefit from other antianginal \nmedicinal products was sub-optimal. \n \nIn the pivotal study, CARISA, Ranexa was added to treatment with atenolol 50 mg once daily, \namlodipine 5 mg once daily, or diltiazem 180 mg once daily. Eight-hundred and twenty-three patients \n(23% women) were randomised to receive 12 weeks of treatment with Ranexa 750 mg twice daily, \n1000 mg twice daily, or placebo. Ranexa demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in prolonging \nexercise time at trough at 12 weeks for both doses studied when used as an add-on therapy. However, \nthere was no difference in exercise duration between the two doses (24 seconds compared to placebo; \np ≤ 0.03).  \n \nRanexa resulted in significant decreases in the number of angina attacks per week and consumption of \nshort-acting nitroglycerin compared to placebo. Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop during \ntreatment and a rebound increase in angina attacks was not observed following abrupt discontinuation. \nThe improvement in exercise duration in women was about 33% of the improvement in men at the \n1000 mg twice-daily dose level. However, men and women had similar reductions in frequency of \nangina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption. Given the dose-dependent side effects and similar \nefficacy at 750 and 1000 mg twice daily, a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily is recommended.  \n \nIn a second study, ERICA, Ranexa was added to treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily (the \nmaximum labelled dose). Five-hundred and sixty-five patients were randomised to receive an initial \ndose of Ranexa 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with \nRanexa 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg \nonce daily. Additionally, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Ranexa \nresulted in significant decreases in the number of angina attacks per week (p = 0.028) and \nconsumption of short-acting nitroglycerin (p = 0.014) compared to placebo. Both the average number \nof angina attacks and nitroglycerin tablets consumed decreased by approximately one per week.   \n \nIn the main dose-finding study, MARISA, ranolazine was used as monotherapy. One-hundred and \nninety-one patients were randomised to treatment with Ranexa 500 mg twice daily, 1000 mg twice \ndaily, 1500 mg twice daily, and matching placebo, each for 1 week in a crossover design. Ranexa was \nsignificantly superior to placebo in prolonging exercise time, time to angina, and time to 1 mm ST \nsegment depression at all doses studied with an observed dose-response relationship. Improvement of \nexercise duration was statistically significant compared to placebo for all three doses of ranolazine \nfrom 24 seconds at 500 mg twice daily to 46 seconds at 1500 mg twice daily, showing a dose-related \nresponse. In this study, exercise duration was longest in the 1500 mg group; however, there was a \ndisproportional increase in side effects, and the 1500 mg dose was not studied further.   \n \nIn a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS, there was no \ndifference in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac \ndeath (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.87), or the frequency of symptomatic documented \narrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%) between Ranexa and placebo when added to standard medical therapy \n(including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, anti-platelet agents, lipid-lowering \n\n\n\n22 \n\nmedicinal products, and ACE inhibitors). Approximately one-half of the patients in MERLIN-TIMI 36 \nhad a history of angina. The results showed that exercise duration was 31 seconds longer in ranolazine \npatients versus placebo patients (p = 0.002). The Seattle Angina Questionnaire showed significant \neffects on several dimensions, including angina frequency (p < 0.001), compared to placebo-treated \npatients.   \n \nA small proportion of non-Caucasians was included in the controlled clinical studies; therefore, no \nconclusions can be drawn regarding the effect and safety in non-Caucasians. \n \nIn a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial (RIVER-PCI) in 2604 patients aged \n≥18 years with a history of chronic angina and incomplete revascularisation after percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI) patients were up-titrated to 1000 mg twice daily (dosage not approved in \nthe current SmPC). No significant difference occurred in the composite primary endpoint (time to first \noccurrence of ischaemia-driven revascularisation or ischaemia-driven hospitalisation without \nrevascularisation) in the ranolazine group (26.2%) versus the placebo group (28.3%), hazard ratio \n0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.10 p= 0.48. The risk of all cause mortality, CV death or major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE) and heart failure hospitalisation was similar between treatment groups \nin the overall population; however, MACE were reported more frequently in patients ≥ 75 years \ntreated with ranolazine compared with placebo (17.0% vs 11.3%, respectively); in addition there was a \nnumerical increase in all cause mortality in patients ≥ 75 years (9.2% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.074). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration of Ranexa, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically observed between \n2 and 6 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing. \n \nAbsorption: The mean absolute bioavailability of ranolazine after oral administration of immediate-\nrelease ranolazine tablets ranged from 35−50%, with large inter-individual variability. Ranexa \nexposure increases more than in proportion to dose. There was a 2.5- to 3-fold increase in steady-state \nAUC as the dose was increased from 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily. In a pharmacokinetic study in \nhealthy volunteers, steady-state Cmax was, on average, approximately 1770 (SD 1040) ng/ml, and \nsteady-state AUC0-12 was, on average, 13,700 (SD 8290) ng x h/ml following a dose of 500 mg twice \ndaily. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption of ranolazine. \n \nDistribution: Approximately 62% of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins, mainly alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein and weakly to albumin. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is about 180 l. \n \nElimination: Ranolazine is eliminated primarily by metabolism. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted \nunchanged in the urine and faeces. Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose of \n[14C]-ranolazine to healthy subjects, 73% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 25% in \nfaeces. \n \nClearance of ranolazine is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose. The elimination half-life is \nabout 2−3 hours after intravenous administration. The terminal half-life at steady state after oral \nadministration of ranolazine is about 7 hours, due to the absorption rate-limited elimination. \n \nBiotransformation: Ranolazine undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, \nranolazine accounts for approximately 13% of the radioactivity in plasma following a single oral \n500 mg dose of [14C]-ranolazine. A large number of metabolites has been identified in human plasma \n(47 metabolites), urine (> 100 metabolites), and faeces (25 metabolites). Fourteen primary pathways \nhave been identified of which O-demethylation and N-dealkylation are the most important. In vitro \nstudies using human liver microsomes indicate that ranolazine is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4, \nbut also by CYP2D6. At 500 mg twice daily, subjects lacking CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers, \nPM) had 62% higher AUC than subjects with CYP2D6 metabolising capacity (extensive metabolisers, \nEM). The corresponding difference at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose was 25%. \n \nSpecial populations \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nThe influence of various factors on the pharmacokinetics of ranolazine was assessed in a population \npharmacokinetic evaluation in 928 angina patients and healthy subjects. \n \nGender effects: Gender had no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters. \n \nElderly patients: Age alone had no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters.  \nHowever, the elderly may have increased ranolazine exposure due to age-related decrease in renal \nfunction. \n \nBody weight: Compared to subjects weighing 70 kg, exposure was estimated to be about 1.4-fold \nhigher in subjects weighing 40 kg.   \n \nCHF: CHF NYHA Class III and IV were estimated to have about 1.3-fold higher plasma \nconcentrations.   \n \nRenal impairment: In a study evaluating the influence of renal function on ranolazine \npharmacokinetics, ranolazine AUC was on average 1.7- to 2-fold higher in subjects with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. There was \na large inter-individual variability in AUC in subjects with renal impairment. The AUC of metabolites \nincreased with decreased renal function. The AUC of one pharmacologically active ranolazine \nmetabolite was 5-fold increased in patients with severe renal impairment.   \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis, a 1.2-fold increase in ranolazine exposure was estimated \nin subjects with moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 40 ml/min). In subjects with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 ml/min), a 1.3- to 1.8-fold increase in ranolazine exposure \nwas estimated.   \n \nThe influence of dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been evaluated.  \n \nHepatic impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine have been evaluated in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nRanolazine AUC was unaffected in patients with mild hepatic impairment but increased 1.8-fold in \npatients with moderate impairment. QT prolongation was more pronounced in these patients.   \n \nPaediatric population: The pharmacokinetic parameters of ranolazine have not been studied in the \npaediatric population (< 18 years). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at levels similar to clinical \nexposure, were as follows: Ranolazine was associated with convulsions and increased mortality in rats \nand dogs at plasma concentrations approximately 3-fold higher than at the proposed maximum clinical \ndose.  \n \nChronic toxicity studies in rats indicated that treatment was associated with adrenal changes at \nexposures slightly greater than those seen in clinical patients. This effect is associated with increased \nplasma cholesterol concentrations. No similar changes have been identified in humans. No effect on \nthe adreno-cortical axis was noted in humans. \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies at doses of ranolazine up to 50 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m2/day) in \nmice and 150 mg/kg/day (900 mg/m2/day) in rats, no relevant increases in the incidence of any tumour \ntypes were seen. These doses are equivalent to 0.1 and 0.8 times, respectively, the maximum \nrecommended human dose of 2 grams on a mg/m2 basis, and represent the maximum tolerated doses in \nthese species. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIn male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) 3.6-fold or \n6.6-fold higher than expected in humans, respectively, had no effect on fertility. \n \nEmbryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits: no effect were noted in rabbit fetuses \nwhen mothers were exposed at levels (AUC) of plasma ranolazine similar to expected human levels. \nIn rats, no effects in fetuses was noted when mothers were exposed to 2-fold greater levels (AUC) than \nexpected in humans, whereas decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed when the \nexposure of mothers was 7.5-fold than those obtained in humans. Post-natal mortality of pups was not \nrecorded when the exposure of nursing mothers was 1.3 fold higher than in expected humans, whereas \nat 3-fold higher exposure post-natal mortality was recorded, concomitant with evidence of milk \nexcretion of ranolazine in rats. No adverse effects on newborn rats were observed at levels of \nexposures similar to those observed in humans. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRanexa 750 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 750 mg of ranolazine.  \nExcipients: Each tablet contains 0.04 mg azo colouring agent E102 and 12.0 mg lactose monohydrate. \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet \nPale green oval-shaped tablet engraved with 750 on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRanexa is indicated in adults as add-on therapy for the symptomatic treatment of patients with stable \nangina pectoris who are inadequately controlled or intolerant to first-line antianginal therapies (such as \nbeta-blockers and/or calcium antagonists).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nRanexa is available as 375 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg prolonged-release tablets.   \n \nAdults: The recommended initial dose of Ranexa is 375 mg twice daily. After 2–4 weeks, the dose \nshould be titrated to 500 mg twice daily and, according to the patient’s response, further titrated to a \nrecommended maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily (see section 5.1).  \n \nIf a patient experiences treatment-related adverse events (e.g. dizziness, nausea, or vomiting), down-\ntitration of Ranexa to 500 mg or 375 mg twice daily may be required. If symptoms do not resolve after \ndose reduction, treatment should be discontinued.   \n \nConcomitant treatment with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: Careful dose titration is \nrecommended in patients treated with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, fluconazole, \nerythromycin) or P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).     \n \nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).   \n \nRenal impairment: Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 ml/min) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2). Ranexa is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Ranexa is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly: Dose titration in elderly patients should be exercised with caution (see section 4.4). Elderly \nmay have increased ranolazine exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function (see section 5.2). \nThe incidence of adverse events was higher in the elderly (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nLow weight: The incidence of adverse events was higher in patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg). Dose \ntitration in patients with low weight should be exercised with caution (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF): Dose titration in patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA \nClass III–IV) should be exercised with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Ranexa in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRanexa tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, broken, or chewed. They may be taken \nwith or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nModerate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, \nvoriconazol, posaconazol, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone) (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \nConcomitant administration of Class Ia (e.g. quinidine) or Class III (e.g. dofetilide, sotalol) \nantiarrhythmics other than amiodarone. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating ranolazine to patients in whom an \nincreased exposure is expected: \n\n• Concomitant administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n• Concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n• Mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n• Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 ml/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, \n\nand 5.2). \n• Elderly (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n• Patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n• Patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA Class III–IV) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).    \n\n \nIn patients with a combination of these factors, additional exposure increases are expected. Dose- \ndependent side effects are likely to occur. If Ranexa is used in patients with a combination of several \nof these factors, monitoring of adverse events should be frequent, the dose reduced, and treatment \ndiscontinued, if needed.  \n \nThe risk for increased exposure leading to adverse events in these different subgroups is higher in \npatients lacking CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers, PM) than subjects with CYP2D6 metabolising \ncapacity (extensive metabolisers, EM) (see section 5.2). The above precautions are based on the risk in \na CYP2D6 PM patient, and are needed when the CYP2D6 status is unknown. There is a lower need \nfor precautions in patients with CYP2D6 EM status. If the CYP2D6 status of the patient has been \ndetermined (e.g. by genotyping) or is previously known to be EM, Ranexa can be used with caution in \nthese patients when they have a combination of several of the above risk factors. \n \nQT prolongation: Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. A \npopulation-based analysis of combined data from patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated that \nthe slope of the plasma concentration-QTc relationship was estimated to be 2.4 msec per 1000 ng/ml, \n\n\n\n28 \n\nwhich is approximately equal to a 2- to 7-msec increase over the plasma concentration range for \nranolazine 500 to 1000 mg twice daily. Therefore, caution should be observed when treating patients \nwith a history of congenital or a family history of long QT syndrome, in patients with known acquired \nQT interval prolongation, and in patients treated with drugs affecting the QTc interval (see section 4.5 \nalso). \n \nDrug-drug interactions: Co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers is expected to lead to lack of \nefficacy. Ranexa should not be used in patients treated with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, \nphenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: Renal function decreases with age and it is therefore important to check renal \nfunction at regular intervals during treatment with ranolazine (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8, and 5.2).    \n    \nLactose: This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nAzo colouring agent E102: This medicinal product contains the azo colouring agent E102 which may \ncause allergic reactions.   \n \nSodium: This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per prolonged-release tablet, that is \nto say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on ranolazine \n \nCYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors: Ranolazine is a substrate of cytochrome CYP3A4. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 \nincrease plasma concentrations of ranolazine. The potential for dose-related adverse events (e.g. \nnausea, dizziness) may also increase with increased plasma concentrations. Concomitant treatment \nwith ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased the AUC of ranolazine by 3.0- to 3.9-fold during \nranolazine treatment. Combining ranolazine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, \nketoconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \nnefazodone) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Grapefruit juice is also a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.    \n \nDiltiazem (180 to 360 mg once daily), a moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, causes dose-dependent \nincreases in average ranolazine steady-state concentrations of 1.5- to 2.4-fold. Careful dose titration of \nRanexa is recommended in patients treated with diltiazem and other moderately potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, fluconazole). Down-titration of Ranexa may be required (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRanolazine is a substrate for P-gp. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. ciclosporin, verapamil) increase plasma \nlevels of ranolazine. Verapamil (120 mg three times daily) increases ranolazine steady-state \nconcentrations 2.2-fold. Careful dose titration of Ranexa is recommended in patients treated with P-gp \ninhibitors. Down-titration of Ranexa may be required (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inducers: Rifampicin (600 mg once daily) decreases ranolazine steady-state concentrations \nby approximately 95%. Initiation of treatment with Ranexa should be avoided during administration of \ninducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors: Ranolazine is partially metabolised by CYP2D6; therefore, inhibitors of this \nenzyme may increase plasma concentrations of ranolazine. The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine, \nat a dose of 20 mg once daily, increased steady-state plasma concentrations of ranolazine 1000 mg \ntwice daily by an average of 1.2-fold. No dose adjustment is required. At the dose level 500 mg twice \ndaily, co-administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 could result in an increase in ranolazine \nAUC of about 62%. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nEffects of ranolazine on other medicinal products \n \nRanolazine is a moderate to potent inhibitor of P-gp and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4, and may \nincrease plasma concentrations of P-gp or CYP3A4 substrates. Tissue distribution of drugs which are \ntransported by P-gp may be increased.   \n \nDose adjustment of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin) and CYP3A4 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) may be required \nas RANEXA may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that ranolazine is a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6. Ranexa 750 mg twice daily \nincreased plasma concentrations of metoprolol by 1.8-fold. Therefore the exposure to metoprolol or \nother CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. propafenone and flecainide or, to a lesser extent,. tricyclic \nantidepressants and antipsychotics) may be increased during co-administration with Ranexa, and lower \ndoses of these medicinal products may be required. \n \nThe potential for inhibition of CYP2B6 has not been evaluated. Caution is advised during \nco-administration with CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz, cyclophosphamide). \n \nDigoxin: An increase in plasma digoxin concentrations by an average of 1.5-fold has been reported \nwhen Ranexa and digoxin are co-administered. Therefore, digoxin levels should be monitored \nfollowing initiation and termination of Ranexa therapy. \n \nSimvastatin: Simvastatin metabolism and clearance are highly dependent on CYP3A4. Ranexa \n1000 mg twice daily increased plasma concentrations of simvastatin lactone, simvastatin acid, by \nabout 2-fold. Rhabdomyolysis has been associated with high doses of simvastatin and cases of \nrhabdomyolysis have been observed in patients receiving Ranexa and simvastatin, in postmarketing \nexperience. Limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg once daily in patients taking any dose of Ranexa.  \n \nAtorvastatin: Ranexa 1000 mg twice daily increased Cmax and AUC of atorvastatin 80 mg once daily \nby 1.4- and 1.3 -fold, respectively and changed the Cmax and AUC of atorvastatin metabolites less \nthan 35%. Dose limitation of atorvastatin and appropriate clinical monitoring may be considered when \ntaking Ranexa. \n \nDose limitation of other statins, metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g lovastatin), may be considered when \ntaking Ranexa. \n \nTacrolimus, ciclosporin, sirolimus, everolimus: Increased plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, a \nCYP3A4 substrate, have been observed in patients after ranolazine administration. It is recommended \nthat tacrolimus blood levels are monitored when co-administering Ranexa and tacrolimus and that \ntacrolimus dosage is adjusted accordingly. This is also recommended for other CYP3A4 substrates \nwith a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., ciclosporin, sirolimus, everolimus). \n \nDrugs transported by the Organic Cation Transporter-2 (OCT2): Plasma exposure of metformin \n(1000 mg twice daily) increased 1.4- and 1.8-fold in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus when co-\nadministered with RANEXA 500 mg and 1000 mg twice daily respectively. The exposure of other \nOCT2 substrates, including but not limited to pindolol and varenicline, may be affected to a similar \ndegree. \n \nThere is a theoretical risk that concomitant treatment of ranolazine with other drugs known to prolong \nthe QTc interval may give rise to a pharmacodynamic interaction and increase the possible risk of \nventricular arrhythmias. Examples of such drugs include certain antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, \nastemizole, mizolastine), certain antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), \nerythromycin, and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, doxepin, amitriptyline). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: There are limited amount of data from the use of ranolazine in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals showed embryo toxicity (see Section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Ranexa \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding: It is unknown whether ranolazine is excreted in human breast milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of ranolazine in milk (for details \nsee Section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Ranexa should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility: In animals, reproduction studies indicated no adverse effects on fertility (see section 5.3). \nThe effect of ranolazine on human fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Ranexa on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nRanexa may cause dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, confusional state, coordination abnormal, and \nhallucination (see section 4.8), which may affect the ability to drive and use machines.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nUndesirable effects in patients receiving Ranexa are generally mild to moderate in severity and often \ndevelop within the first 2 weeks of treatment. These were reported during the Phase 3 clinical \ndevelopment programme, which included a total of 1,030 chronic angina patients treated with Ranexa.   \n \nThe adverse events, considered to be at least possibly related to treatment, are listed below by body \nsystem, organ class, and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and \nvery rare (< 1/10,000).  \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon: anorexia, decreased appetite, dehydration. \nRare: hyponatremia \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: anxiety, insomnia, confusional state, hallucination. \nRare: disorientation. \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, headache. \nUncommon: lethargy, syncope, hypoaesthesia, somnolence, tremor, postural dizziness, paresthesia. \nRare: amnesia, depressed level of consciousness, loss of consciousness, coordination abnormal, gait \n\ndisturbance, parosmia. \n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: blurred vision, visual disturbance, diplopia.  \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: vertigo, tinnitus. \nRare: impaired hearing.  \n \nVascular disorders  \nUncommon: hot flush, hypotension. \nRare: peripheral coldness, orthostatic hypotension.  \n \nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders \n\n\n\n31 \n\nUncommon: dyspnoea, cough, epistaxis. \nRare: throat tightness. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: constipation, vomiting, nausea. \nUncommon: abdominal pain, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence, stomach discomfort.  \nRare: pancreatitis, erosive duodenitis, oral hypoaesthesia.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: pruritus, hyperhydrosis. \nRare: angioedema, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, cold sweat, rash. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: pain in extremity, muscle cramp, joint swelling, muscular weakness.  \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: dysuria, haematuria, chromaturia. \nRare: acute renal failure, urinary retention. \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nRare: erectile dysfunction. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: asthenia. \nUncommon: fatigue, peripheral oedema. \n \nInvestigations \nUncommon: increased blood creatinine, increased blood urea, prolonged QT corrected interval, \n\nincreased platelet or white blood cell count, decreased weight. \nRare: elevated levels of hepatic enzyme. \n \nThe adverse event profile was generally similar in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study. In this long term \nstudy, acute renal failure was also reported with an incidence less than 1% in placebo and ranolazine \npatients. Evaluations in patients who may be considered at higher risk of adverse events when treated \nwith other antianginal medicinal products, e.g. patients with diabetes, Class I and II heart failure, or \nobstructive airway disease, confirmed that these conditions were not associated with clinically \nmeaningful increases in the incidence of adverse events. \n \nAn increased incidence of adverse events was seen among ranolazine treated patients in the RIVER-\nPCI trial (see section 5.1) where patients with incomplete revascularization post-PCI were given \nranolazine up to 1000 mg twice daily or placebo for approximately 70 weeks. In this study, there was a \nhigher reporting rate for congestive heart failure in the ranolazine group (2.2% vs 1.0% in placebo). \nAlso, transient ischemic attack occurred more frequently in patients treated with ranolazine 1000 mg \ntwice daily compared with placebo (1.0% vs 0.2%, respectively); however, the incidence of stroke was \nsimilar between treatment groups (ranolazine 1.7% vs placebo 1.5%). \n \nElderly, renal impairment, and low weight: In general, adverse events occurred more frequently \namong elderly patients and patients with renal impairment; however, the types of events in these \nsubgroups were similar to those observed in the general population. Of the most commonly reported, \nthe following events occurred more often with Ranexa (placebo-corrected frequencies) in elderly \n(≥ 75 years of age) than younger patients (< 75 years of age): constipation (8% versus 5%), nausea \n(6% versus 3%), hypotension (5% versus 1%), and vomiting (4% versus 1%).   \n \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30–80 ml/min) compared \nto those with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), the most commonly reported \nevents and their placebo-corrected frequencies included: constipation (8% versus 4%), dizziness (7% \nversus 5%), and nausea (4% versus 2%).  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nIn general, the type and frequency of adverse events reported in patients with low body weight \n(≤ 60 kg) were similar to those of patients with higher weight (> 60 kg); however, the placebo-\ncorrected frequencies of the following common adverse events were higher in low body weight than \nheavier patients: nausea (14% versus 2%), vomiting (6% versus 1%), and hypotension (4% versus \n2%).  \n \nLaboratory findings: Small, clinically insignificant, reversible elevations in serum creatinine levels \nhave been observed in healthy subjects and patients treated with Ranexa. There was no renal toxicity \nrelated to these findings. A renal function study in healthy volunteers demonstrated a reduction in \ncreatinine clearance with no change in glomerular filtration rate consistent with inhibition of renal \ntubular secretion of creatinine.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn an oral high-dose tolerability study in angina patients, the incidence of dizziness, nausea, and \nvomiting increased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to these adverse events, diplopia, \nlethargy, and syncope were observed in an intravenous overdose study in healthy volunteers. In the \nevent of overdose, the patient should be closely monitored and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive.  \n\n \nApproximately 62% of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, complete clearance by \nhaemodialysis is unlikely. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB18 \n \nMechanism of action: The mechanism of action of ranolazine is largely unknown. Ranolazine may \nhave some antianginal effects by inhibition of the late sodium current in cardiac cells. This reduces \nintracellular sodium accumulation and consequently decreases intracellular calcium overload. \nRanolazine, via its action to decrease the late sodium current, is considered to reduce these \nintracellular ionic imbalances during ischaemia. This reduction in cellular calcium overload is \nexpected to improve myocardial relaxation and thereby decrease left ventricular diastolic stiffness. \nClinical evidence of inhibition of the late sodium current by ranolazine is provided by a significant \nshortening of the QTc interval and an improvement in diastolic relaxation in an open-label study of \n5 patients with a long QT syndrome (LQT3 having the SCN5A ∆KPQ gene mutation). \n \nThese effects do not depend upon changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or vasodilation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nHaemodynamic effects: Minimal decreases in mean heart rate (< 2 beats per minute) and mean \nsystolic blood pressure (< 3 mm Hg) were observed in patients treated with ranolazine either alone or \nin combination with other antianginal medicinal products in controlled studies. \n \nElectrocardiographic effects: Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval \n(about 6 msec at 1000 mg twice daily), reductions in T wave amplitude, and in some cases notched \n\n\n\n33 \n\nT waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranexa. These effects of ranolazine on the \nsurface electrocardiogram are believed to result from inhibition of the fast-rectifying potassium \ncurrent, which prolongs the ventricular action potential, and from inhibition of the late sodium current, \nwhich shortens the ventricular action potential. A population analysis of combined data from \n1,308 patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated a mean increase in QTc from baseline of 2.4 msec \nper 1000 ng/ml ranolazine plasma concentration. This value is consistent with data from pivotal \nclinical studies, where mean changes from baseline in QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) after doses of \n500 and 750 mg twice daily were 1.9 and 4.9 msec, respectively. The slope is higher in patients with \nclinically significant hepatic impairment.   \n \nIn a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS, there was no \ndifference between Ranexa and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk \nranolazine:placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac death (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.87), or the \nfrequency of symptomatic documented arrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%). \n  \nNo proarrhythmic effects were observed in 3,162 patients treated with Ranexa based on 7-day Holter \nmonitoring in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias \nin patients treated with Ranexa (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \n≥ 8 beats (5% versus 8%). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety: Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Ranexa in \nthe treatment of patients with chronic angina, either alone or when the benefit from other antianginal \nmedicinal products was sub-optimal. \n \nIn the pivotal study, CARISA, Ranexa was added to treatment with atenolol 50 mg once daily, \namlodipine 5 mg once daily, or diltiazem 180 mg once daily. Eight-hundred and twenty-three patients \n(23% women) were randomised to receive 12 weeks of treatment with Ranexa 750 mg twice daily, \n1000 mg twice daily, or placebo. Ranexa demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in prolonging \nexercise time at trough at 12 weeks for both doses studied when used as an add-on therapy. However, \nthere was no difference in exercise duration between the two doses (24 seconds compared to placebo; \np ≤ 0.03).  \n \nRanexa resulted in significant decreases in the number of angina attacks per week and consumption of \nshort-acting nitroglycerin compared to placebo. Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop during \ntreatment and a rebound increase in angina attacks was not observed following abrupt discontinuation. \nThe improvement in exercise duration in women was about 33% of the improvement in men at the \n1000 mg twice-daily dose level. However, men and women had similar reductions in frequency of \nangina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption. Given the dose-dependent side effects and similar \nefficacy at 750 and 1000 mg twice daily, a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily is recommended.  \n \nIn a second study, ERICA, Ranexa was added to treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily (the \nmaximum labelled dose). Five-hundred and sixty-five patients were randomised to receive an initial \ndose of Ranexa 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with \nRanexa 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg \nonce daily. Additionally, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Ranexa \nresulted in significant decreases in the number of angina attacks per week (p = 0.028) and \nconsumption of short-acting nitroglycerin (p = 0.014) compared to placebo. Both the average number \nof angina attacks and nitroglycerin tablets consumed decreased by approximately one per week.   \n \nIn the main dose-finding study, MARISA, ranolazine was used as monotherapy. One-hundred and \nninety-one patients were randomised to treatment with Ranexa 500 mg twice daily, 1000 mg twice \ndaily, 1500 mg twice daily, and matching placebo, each for 1 week in a crossover design. Ranexa was \nsignificantly superior to placebo in prolonging exercise time, time to angina, and time to 1 mm ST \nsegment depression at all doses studied with an observed dose-response relationship. Improvement of \nexercise duration was statistically significant compared to placebo for all three doses of ranolazine \nfrom 24 seconds at 500 mg twice daily to 46 seconds at 1500 mg twice daily, showing a dose-related \n\n\n\n34 \n\nresponse. In this study, exercise duration was longest in the 1500 mg group; however, there was a \ndisproportional increase in side effects, and the 1500 mg dose was not studied further.   \n \nIn a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS, there was no \ndifference in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac \ndeath (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.87), or the frequency of symptomatic documented \narrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%) between Ranexa and placebo when added to standard medical therapy \n(including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, anti-platelet agents, lipid-lowering \nmedicinal products, and ACE inhibitors). Approximately one-half of the patients in MERLIN-TIMI 36 \nhad a history of angina. The results showed that exercise duration was 31 seconds longer in ranolazine \npatients versus placebo patients (p = 0.002). The Seattle Angina Questionnaire showed significant \neffects on several dimensions, including angina frequency (p < 0.001), compared to placebo-treated \npatients.   \n \nA small proportion of non-Caucasians was included in the controlled clinical studies; therefore, no \nconclusions can be drawn regarding the effect and safety in non-Caucasians. \n \nIn a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial (RIVER-PCI) in 2604 patients aged \n≥18 years with a history of chronic angina and incomplete revascularisation after percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI) patients were up-titrated to 1000 mg twice daily (dosage not approved in \nthe current SmPC). No significant difference occurred in the composite primary endpoint (time to first \noccurrence of ischaemia-driven revascularisation or ischaemia-driven hospitalisation without \nrevascularisation) in the ranolazine group (26.2%) versus the placebo group (28.3%), hazard ratio \n0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.10 p= 0.48. The risk of all cause mortality, CV death or major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE) and heart failure hospitalisation was similar between treatment groups \nin the overall population; however, MACE were reported more frequently in patients ≥ 75 years \ntreated with ranolazine compared with placebo (17.0% vs 11.3%, respectively); in addition there was a \nnumerical increase in all cause mortality in patients ≥ 75 years (9.2% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.074). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration of Ranexa, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically observed between \n2 and 6 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing. \n \nAbsorption: The mean absolute bioavailability of ranolazine after oral administration of immediate-\nrelease ranolazine tablets ranged from 35−50%, with large inter-individual variability. Ranexa \nexposure increases more than in proportion to dose. There was a 2.5- to 3-fold increase in steady-state \nAUC as the dose was increased from 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily. In a pharmacokinetic study in \nhealthy volunteers, steady-state Cmax was, on average, approximately 1770 (SD 1040) ng/ml, and \nsteady-state AUC0-12 was, on average, 13,700 (SD 8290) ng x h/ml following a dose of 500 mg twice \ndaily. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption of ranolazine. \n \nDistribution: Approximately 62% of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins, mainly alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein and weakly to albumin. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is about 180 l. \n \nElimination: Ranolazine is eliminated primarily by metabolism. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted \nunchanged in the urine and faeces. Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose of \n[14C]-ranolazine to healthy subjects, 73% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 25% in \nfaeces. \n \nClearance of ranolazine is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose. The elimination half-life is \nabout 2−3 hours after intravenous administration. The terminal half-life at steady state after oral \nadministration of ranolazine is about 7 hours, due to the absorption rate-limited elimination. \n \nBiotransformation: Ranolazine undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, \nranolazine accounts for approximately 13% of the radioactivity in plasma following a single oral \n500 mg dose of [14C]-ranolazine. A large number of metabolites has been identified in human plasma \n\n\n\n35 \n\n(47 metabolites), urine (> 100 metabolites), and faeces (25 metabolites). Fourteen primary pathways \nhave been identified of which O-demethylation and N-dealkylation are the most important. In vitro \nstudies using human liver microsomes indicate that ranolazine is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4, \nbut also by CYP2D6. At 500 mg twice daily, subjects lacking CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers, \nPM) had 62% higher AUC than subjects with CYP2D6 metabolising capacity (extensive metabolisers, \nEM). The corresponding difference at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose was 25%. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe influence of various factors on the pharmacokinetics of ranolazine was assessed in a population \npharmacokinetic evaluation in 928 angina patients and healthy subjects. \n \nGender effects: Gender had no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters. \n \nElderly patients: Age alone had no clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters.  \nHowever, the elderly may have increased ranolazine exposure due to age-related decrease in renal \nfunction. \n \nBody weight: Compared to subjects weighing 70 kg, exposure was estimated to be about 1.4-fold \nhigher in subjects weighing 40 kg.   \n \nCHF: CHF NYHA Class III and IV were estimated to have about 1.3-fold higher plasma \nconcentrations.   \n \nRenal impairment: In a study evaluating the influence of renal function on ranolazine \npharmacokinetics, ranolazine AUC was on average 1.7- to 2-fold higher in subjects with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. There was \na large inter-individual variability in AUC in subjects with renal impairment. The AUC of metabolites \nincreased with decreased renal function. The AUC of one pharmacologically active ranolazine \nmetabolite was 5-fold increased in patients with severe renal impairment.   \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis, a 1.2-fold increase in ranolazine exposure was estimated \nin subjects with moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 40 ml/min). In subjects with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 ml/min), a 1.3- to 1.8-fold increase in ranolazine exposure \nwas estimated.   \n \nThe influence of dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been evaluated.  \n \nHepatic impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine have been evaluated in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nRanolazine AUC was unaffected in patients with mild hepatic impairment but increased 1.8-fold in \npatients with moderate impairment. QT prolongation was more pronounced in these patients.   \n \nPaediatric population: The pharmacokinetic parameters of ranolazine have not been studied in the \npaediatric population (< 18 years). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at levels similar to clinical \nexposure, were as follows: Ranolazine was associated with convulsions and increased mortality in rats \nand dogs at plasma concentrations approximately 3-fold higher than at the proposed maximum clinical \ndose.  \n \nChronic toxicity studies in rats indicated that treatment was associated with adrenal changes at \nexposures slightly greater than those seen in clinical patients. This effect is associated with increased \nplasma cholesterol concentrations. No similar changes have been identified in humans. No effect on \nthe adreno-cortical axis was noted in humans. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies at doses of ranolazine up to 50 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m2/day) in \nmice and 150 mg/kg/day (900 mg/m2/day) in rats, no relevant increases in the incidence of any tumour \ntypes were seen. These doses are equivalent to 0.1 and 0.8 times, respectively, the maximum \nrecommended human dose of 2 grams on a mg/m2 basis, and represent the maximum tolerated doses in \nthese species. \n  \nIn male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) 3.6-fold or \n6.6-fold higher than expected in humans, respectively, had no effect on fertility. \n \nEmbryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits: no effect were noted in rabbit fetuses \nwhen mothers were exposed at levels (AUC) of plasma ranolazine similar to expected human levels. \nIn rats, no effects in fetuses was noted when mothers were exposed to 2-fold greater levels (AUC) than \nexpected in humans, whereas decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed when the \nexposure of mothers was 7.5-fold than those obtained in humans. Post-natal mortality of pups was not \nrecorded when the exposure of nursing mothers was 1.3 fold higher than in expected humans, whereas \nat 3-fold higher exposure post-natal mortality was recorded, concomitant with evidence of milk \nexcretion of ranolazine in rats. No adverse effects on newborn rats were observed at levels of \nexposures similar to those observed in humans. \n \n \n6.
