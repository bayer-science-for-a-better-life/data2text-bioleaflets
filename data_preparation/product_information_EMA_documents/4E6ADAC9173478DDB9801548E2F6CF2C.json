NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nStivarga 40 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 40 mg of regorafenib. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nEach daily dose of 160 mg contains 2.427 mmol (or 55.8 mg) of sodium (see section 4.4). \nEach daily dose of 160 mg contains 1.68 mg of lecithin (derived from soya) (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nLight pink film-coated tablets, oval shaped with a length of 16 mm and a width of 7 mm marked with \n‘BAYER’ on one side and ‘40’ on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nStivarga is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with \n \n- metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with, or are not considered \n\ncandidates for, available therapies. These include fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, an \nanti-VEGF therapy and an anti-EGFR therapy (see section 5.1)  \n\n \n- unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) who progressed on or are \n\nintolerant to prior treatment with imatinib and sunitinib \n \n- hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nStivarga should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the administration of anticancer therapy. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of regorafenib is 160 mg (4 tablets of 40 mg) taken once daily for 3 weeks \nfollowed by 1 week off therapy. This 4-week period is considered a treatment cycle. \n \nIf a dose is missed, then it should be taken on the same day as soon as the patient remembers. The \npatient should not take two doses on the same day to make up for a missed dose. In case of vomiting \nafter regorafenib administration, the patient should not take additional tablets. \n \nTreatment should continue as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients with performance status (PS) 2 or higher were excluded from clinical studies. There is limited \ndata in patients with PS ≥2. \n\n \nPosology adjustments \nDose interruptions and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. \nDose modifications are to be applied in 40 mg (one tablet) steps. The lowest recommended daily dose \nis 80 mg. The maximum daily dose is 160 mg. \n \nFor recommended dose modifications and measures in case of hand-foot skin reaction \n(HFSR)/palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome see Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose modifications and measures for HFSR \n\n \nSkin toxicity grade Occurrence Recommended dose modification and measures \n\nGrade 1 Any Maintain dose level and immediately institute supportive measures for symptomatic relief.  \n\nGrade 2 \n\n1st occurrence \n\nDecrease dose by 40 mg (one tablet) and \nimmediately institute supportive measures. \nIf no improvement occurs despite dose reduction, \ninterrupt therapy for a minimum of 7 days, until \ntoxicity resolves to Grade 0-1.  \nA dose re-escalation is permitted at the discretion \nof the physician. \n\nNo improvement \nwithin 7 days or \n2nd occurrence \n\nInterrupt therapy until toxicity resolves to \nGrade 0-1. \nWhen re-starting treatment, decrease dose by \n40 mg (one tablet).  \nA dose re-escalation is permitted at the discretion \nof the physician. \n\n3rd occurrence \n\nInterrupt therapy until toxicity resolves to \nGrade 0-1. \nWhen re-starting treatment, decrease dose by \n40 mg (one tablet).  \nA dose re-escalation is permitted at the discretion \nof the physician. \n\n4th occurrence Discontinue treatment with Stivarga permanently. \n\nGrade 3 \n\n1st occurrence \n\nInstitute supportive measures immediately. \nInterrupt therapy for a minimum of 7 days until \ntoxicity resolves to Grade 0-1.  \nWhen re-starting treatment, decrease dose by \n40 mg (one tablet).  \nA dose re-escalation is permitted at the discretion \nof the physician.  \n\n2nd occurrence \n\nInstitute supportive measures immediately. \nInterrupt therapy for a minimum of 7 days until \ntoxicity resolves to Grade 0-1.  \nWhen re-starting treatment, decrease dose by \n40 mg (one tablet). \n\n3rd occurrence Discontinue treatment with Stivarga permanently. \n \nFor recommended measures and dose modifications in case of worsening of liver function tests \nconsidered related to treatment with Stivarga see Table 2 (see also section 4.4). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nTable 2: Recommended measures and dose modifications in case of drug-related liver function \ntest abnormalities  \n \n\nObserved elevations \nof ALT and/or AST Occurrence Recommended measures and dose modification \n\n≤5 times upper limit of \nnormal (ULN)  \n(maximum Grade 2) \n\nAny occurrence \nContinue Stivarga treatment.  \nMonitor liver function weekly until transaminases \nreturn to <3 times ULN (Grade 1) or baseline. \n\n>5 times ULN \n≤20 times ULN \n(Grade 3) \n\n1st occurrence \n\nInterrupt Stivarga treatment.  \nMonitor transaminases weekly until return to <3 times \nULN or baseline. \n\n \n\nRestart: If the potential benefit outweighs the risk of \nhepatotoxicity, re-start Stivarga treatment, reduce dose \nby 40 mg (one tablet), and monitor liver function \nweekly for at least 4 weeks.  \n\n Re-occurrence Discontinue treatment with Stivarga permanently. \n>20 times ULN  \n(Grade 4) Any occurrence Discontinue treatment with Stivarga permanently. \n\n>3 times ULN \n(Grade 2 or higher) \nwith concurrent \nbilirubin >2 times \nULN \n\nAny occurrence \n\nDiscontinue treatment with Stivarga permanently.  \nMonitor liver function weekly until resolution or return \nto baseline.  \nException: patients with Gilbert’s syndrome who \ndevelop elevated transaminases should be managed as \nper the above outlined recommendations for the \nrespective observed elevation of ALT and/or AST. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nRegorafenib is eliminated mainly via the hepatic route. \nIn clinical studies, no relevant differences in exposure, safety or efficacy were observed between \npatients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and normal hepatic function. No dose \nadjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Since only limited data are available \nfor patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), no dose recommendation can be \nprovided. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nStivarga is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) as \nStivarga has not been studied in this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nAvailable clinical data indicate similar exposure of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 in \npatients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal \nfunction. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment \n(see also section 5.2).  \n \nElderly population \nIn clinical studies, no relevant differences in exposure, safety or efficacy were observed between \nelderly (aged 65 years and above) and younger patients (see also section 5.2). \n \nGender \nIn clinical studies, no relevant differences in exposure, safety or efficacy were observed between male \nand female patients. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see also section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nEthnic differences \nIn clinical studies, no relevant differences in exposure or efficacy were observed between patients of \ndifferent ethnic groups. A higher incidence of hand foot skin reaction (HFSR)/palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia syndrome, severe liver function test abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction was \nobserved in Asian (in particular Japanese) patients treated with Stivarga compared with Caucasians. \nThe Asian patients treated with Stivarga in clinical studies were primarily from East Asia (~90%). \nThere is limited data on regorafenib in the black patient population. \nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on ethnicity (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Stivarga in the paediatric population in the indication of metastatic \ncolorectal cancer.  \nThe safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients below 18 years of age in the indication \ngastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) have not been established. No data are available. \nThere is no relevant use of Stivarga in the paediatric population in the indication of hepatocellular \ncarcinoma. \n \nMethod of administration \nStivarga is for oral use. \n \nStivarga should be taken at the same time each day. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water \nafter a light meal that contains less than 30% fat. An example of a light (low-fat) meal would include \n1 portion of cereal (about 30 g), 1 glass of skimmed milk, 1 slice of toast with jam, 1 glass of apple \njuice, and 1 cup of coffee or tea (520 calories, 2 g fat). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatic effects \nAbnormalities of liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase \n[AST] and bilirubin) have been frequently observed in patients treated with Stivarga. Severe liver \nfunction test abnormalities (Grade 3 to 4) and hepatic dysfunction with clinical manifestations \n(including fatal outcomes) have been reported in a small proportion of patients (see section 4.8).  \nIn clinical trials, a higher incidence of severe liver function test abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction \nwas observed in Asian (in particular Japanese) patients treated with Stivarga, compared with \nCaucasians (see section 4.2). \n \nIt is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of \ntreatment with Stivarga and monitor closely (at least every two weeks) during the first 2 months of \ntreatment. Thereafter, periodic monitoring should be continued at least monthly and as clinically \nindicated.  \n \nRegorafenib is a uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 inhibitor (see section 4.5). \nMild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s syndrome. \n \nFor patients with observed worsening of liver function tests considered related to treatment with \nStivarga (i.e. where no alternative cause is evident, such as post-hepatic cholestasis or disease \nprogression), the dose modification and monitoring advice in Table 2 should be followed (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nRegorafenib is eliminated mainly via the hepatic route.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nClose monitoring of the overall safety is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2). Stivarga is not recommended for use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) as Stivarga has not been studied in this population and \nexposure might be increased in these patients. \n \nInfections \nStivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of infection events, some of which were fatal \n(see section 4.8). \nIn cases of worsening infection events, interruption of Stivarga treatment should be considered. \n \nHaemorrhage \nStivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of haemorrhagic events, some of which were \nfatal (see section 4.8). Blood counts and coagulation parameters should be monitored in patients with \nconditions predisposing to bleeding, and in those treated with anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin and \nphenprocoumon) or other concomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding. Screening \nfor and subsequent treatment of oesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis should be \nperformed as per standard of care before starting treatment with Stivarga. In the event of severe \nbleeding necessitating urgent medical intervention, permanent discontinuation of Stivarga should be \nconsidered. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation and fistula \nGastrointestinal perforation (including fatal outcome) and fistulae have been reported in patients \ntreated with Stivarga (see section 4.8). These events are also known to be common disease-related \ncomplications in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies. Discontinuation of Stivarga is \nrecommended in patients developing gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. \n \nCardiac ischaemia and infarction \nStivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of myocardial ischaemia and infarction (see \nsection 4.8). Patients with unstable angina or new onset angina (within 3 months of starting Stivarga \ntherapy), recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of starting Stivarga therapy) and those with \ncardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification 2 or higher were excluded from \nthe clinical studies. \n \nPatients with a history of ischaemic heart disease should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms \nof myocardial ischaemia. In patients who develop cardiac ischaemia and/or infarction, interruption of \nStivarga is recommended until resolution. The decision to re-start Stivarga therapy should be based on \ncareful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of the individual patient. Stivarga should be \npermanently discontinued if there is no resolution. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \nPRES has been reported in association with Stivarga treatment (see section 4.8). Signs and symptoms \nof PRES include seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance or cortical blindness, \nwith or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging. \nIn patients developing PRES, discontinuation of Stivarga, along with control of hypertension and \nsupportive medical management of other symptoms is recommended. \n \nArterial hypertension \nStivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of arterial hypertension (see section 4.8). \nBlood pressure should be controlled prior to initiation of treatment with Stivarga. It is recommended to \nmonitor blood pressure and to treat hypertension in accordance with standard medical practice. In \ncases of severe or persistent hypertension despite adequate medical management, treatment should be \ntemporarily interrupted and/or the dose reduced at the discretion of the physician (see section 4.2). In \ncase of hypertensive crisis, Stivarga should be discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections  \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Stivarga, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nWound healing complications \nAs medicinal products with anti-angiogenic properties may suppress or interfere with wound healing, \ntemporary interruption of Stivarga is recommended for precautionary reasons in patients undergoing \nmajor surgical procedures. The decision to resume treatment with Stivarga following major surgical \nintervention should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. \n \nDermatological toxicity \nHand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome and rash represent the \nmost frequently observed dermatological adverse reactions with Stivarga (see section 4.8). In clinical \ntrials, a higher incidence of HFSR was observed in Asian (in particular Japanese) patients treated with \nStivarga, compared with Caucasians (see section 4.2). Measures for the prevention of HFSR include \ncontrol of calluses and use of shoe cushions and gloves to prevent pressure stress to soles and palms. \nManagement of HFSR may include the use of keratolytic creams (e.g. urea-, salicylic acid-, or alpha \nhydroxyl acid-based creams applied sparingly only on affected areas) and moisturizing creams \n(applied liberally) for symptomatic relief. Dose reduction and/or temporary interruption of Stivarga, or \nin severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation of Stivarga should be considered (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nBiochemical and metabolic laboratory test abnormalities \nStivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of electrolyte abnormalities (including \nhypophosphatemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia) and metabolic abnormalities \n(including increases in thyroid stimulating hormone, lipase and amylase). The abnormalities are \ngenerally of mild to moderate severity, not associated with clinical manifestations, and do not usually \nrequire dose interruptions or reductions. It is recommended to monitor biochemical and metabolic \nparameters during Stivarga treatment and to institute appropriate replacement therapy according to \nstandard clinical practice if required. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of \nStivarga should be considered in case of persistent or recurrent significant abnormalities (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients \nThis medicinal product contains 55.8 mg sodium per daily dose of 160 mg, equivalent to 3% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.Each daily dose of 160 mg \ncontains 1.68 mg of lecithin (derived from soya).  \n \nDisease-specific precautions – Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \nIn the pivotal placebo-controlled phase III study, patients received prior therapy with sorafenib.  \nThere is insufficient data on patients who discontinued sorafenib therapy due to sorafenib-related \ntoxicity or only tolerated a low dose (< 400 mg daily) of sorafenib. The tolerability of Stivarga in these \npatients has not been established. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A4 and UGT1A9/inducers of CYP3A4 \nIn vitro data indicate that regorafenib is metabolized by cytochrome CYP3A4 and uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyl transferase UGT1A9.  \n \nAdministration of ketoconazole (400 mg for 18 days), a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single dose \nof regorafenib (160 mg on day 5) resulted in an increase in mean exposure (AUC) of regorafenib of \napproximately 33%, and a decrease in mean exposure of the active metabolites, M-2 (N-oxide) and \n\n\n\n8 \n\nM-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl), of approximately 90%. It is recommended to avoid concomitant use \nof strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin and voriconazole) as their influence on the steady-state \nexposure of regorafenib and its metabolites has not been studied. \n \nCo-administration of a strong UGT1A9 inhibitor (e.g. mefenamic acid, diflunisal, and niflumic acid) \nduring regorafenib treatment should be avoided, as their influence on the steady-state exposure of \nregorafenib and its metabolites has not been studied. \n \nAdministration of rifampicin (600 mg for 9 days), a strong CYP3A4 inducer, with a single dose of \nregorafenib (160 mg on day 7) resulted in a reduction in AUC of regorafenib of approximately 50%, a \n3- to 4-fold increase in mean exposure of the active metabolite M-5, and no change in exposure of \nactive metabolite M-2. Other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital \nand St. John’s wort) may also increase metabolism of regorafenib. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should \nbe avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to \ninduce CYP3A4 should be considered. \n \nUGT1A1 and UGT1A9 substrates  \nIn vitro data indicate that regorafenib as well as its active metabolite M-2 inhibit glucuronidation \nmediated by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 whereas M-5 only inhibits UGT1A1 at concentrations which are \nachieved in vivo at steady state. Administration of regorafenib with a 5-day break prior to \nadministration of irinotecan resulted in an increase of approximately 44% in AUC of SN-38, a \nsubstrate of UGT1A1 and an active metabolite of irinotecan. An increase in AUC of irinotecan of \napproximately 28% was also observed. This indicates that co-administration of regorafenib may \nincrease systemic exposure to UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 substrates.  \n \nBreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein substrates \nAdministration of regorafenib (160 mg for 14 days) prior to administration of a single dose of \nrosuvastatin (5 mg), a BCRP substrate, resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC) of \nrosuvastatin and a 4.6-fold increase in Cmax. \n \nThis indicates that co-administration of regorafenib may increase the plasma concentrations of other \nconcomitant BCRP substrates (e.g. methotrexate, fluvastatin, atorvastatin). Therefore, it is \nrecommended to monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposure to BCRP \nsubstrates. \n \nClinical data indicate that regorafenib has no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics, therefore can be \ngiven concomitantly with p-glycoprotein substrates, such as digoxin, without a clinically meaningful \ndrug interaction. \n \nInhibitors of P-glycoprotein and BCRP/Inducers of P-glycoprotein and BCRP \nIn vitro studies indicate that the active metabolites M-2 and M-5 are substrates for P-glycoprotein and \nBCRP. Inhibitors and inducers of BCRP and P-glycoprotein may interfere with the exposure of M-2 \nand M-5. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown (see also section 5.2). \n \nCYP isoform-selective substrates \nIn vitro data indicate that regorafenib is a competitive inhibitor of the cytochromes CYP2C8 (Ki value \nof 0.6 micromolar), CYP2C9 (Ki value of 4.7 micromolar), CYP2B6 (Ki value of 5.2 micromolar) at \nconcentrations which are achieved in vivo at steady state (peak plasma concentration of \n8.1 micromolar). The in vitro inhibitory potency towards CYP3A4 (Ki value of 11.1 micromolar) and \nCYP2C19 (Ki value of 16.4 micromolar) was less pronounced.  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nA clinical probe substrate study was performed to evaluate the effect of 14 days of dosing with 160 mg \nregorafenib on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone) CYP2C9 \n(S-warfarin), CYP 2C19 (omeprazole) and CYP3A4 (midazolam). \n \nPharmacokinetic data indicate that regorafenib may be given concomitantly with substrates of \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 without a clinically meaningful drug interaction (see \nalso section 4.4). \n \nAntibiotics \nThe concentration-time profile indicates that regorafenib and its metabolites may undergo \nenterohepatic circulation (see section 5.2). Co-administration with neomycin, a poorly absorbed \nantimicrobial agent used for eradicating the gastrointestinal microflora (which may interfere with the \nenterohepatic circulation of regorafenib) had no effect on the regorafenib exposure, but there was an \napproximately 80% decrease in the exposure of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5 which showed in \nvitro and in vivo comparable pharmacological activity as regorafenib. The clinical significance of this \nneomycin interaction is unknown, but may result in a decreased efficacy of regorafenib. \nPharmacokinetic interactions of other antibiotics have not been studied. \n \nBile salt-sequestering agents \nRegorafenib, M-2 and M-5 are likely to undergo enterohepatic circulation (see section 5.2). Bile salt-\nsequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with regorafenib by forming \ninsoluble complexes which may impact absorption (or reabsorption), thus resulting in potentially \ndecreased exposure. The clinical significance of these potential interactions is unknown, but may \nresult in a decreased efficacy of regorafenib. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential must be informed that regorafenib may cause foetal harm.  \nWomen of childbearing potential and men should ensure effective contraception during treatment and \nup to 8 weeks after completion of therapy. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of regorafenib in pregnant women. \nBased on its mechanism of action regorafenib is suspected to cause foetal harm when administered \nduring pregnancy. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nStivarga should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after careful consideration \nof the benefits for the mother and the risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether regorafenib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nIn rats, regorafenib or its metabolites are excreted in milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. Regorafenib could harm infant growth and development (see section 5.3). \nBreast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with Stivarga. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of Stivarga on human fertility. Results from animal studies indicate that \nregorafenib can impair male and female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Stivarga on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. If \npatients experience symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react during treatment with \nStivarga, it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall safety profile of Stivarga is based on data from more than 4,800 treated patients in clinical \ntrials including placebo-controlled phase III data for 636 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer \n(CRC), 132 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and 374 patients with hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (HCC). \n \nThe safety profile of regorafenib in these studies was consistent with the safety results of a phase III B \nstudy conducted in 2872 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease had progressed after \ntreatment with standard therapies. \n \nThe most serious adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Stivarga are severe liver injury, \nhaemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation and infection. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥30%) in patients receiving Stivarga are pain, \nhand foot skin reaction, asthenia/fatigue, diarrhoea, decreased appetite and food intake, hypertension \nand infection. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials in patients treated with Stivarga are shown in \nTable 3. They are classified according to System Organ Class and the most appropriate MedDRA term \nis used to describe a certain reaction and its synonyms and related conditions. \nAdverse drug reactions are grouped according to their frequencies. Frequency groups are defined by \nthe following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nWithin each frequency group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 3: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in clinical trials in patients treated with \nStivarga \n \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n(MedDRA) \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations  \n\nInfection\n* \n\n    \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including \ncysts and \npolyps)  \n\n   Keratoacan-\nthoma/ \nSquamous \ncell \ncarcinoma of \nthe skin \n\n \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nThrombo-\ncytopenia  \nAnaemia \n\nLeucopenia    \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensiti-\nvity reaction \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n(MedDRA) \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n \n\n Hypo-\nthyroidism \n\n   \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders  \n\nDecreased \nappetite and \nfood intake \n\nHypo-\nkalaemia \nHypophos-\nphatemia \nHypo-\ncalcaemia \nHypo-\nnatraemia \nHypomag-\nnesaemia \nHyperuri-\ncaemia \nDehy-\ndration \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders  \n\n Headache \nTremor \nPeripheral \nneuropathy \n\n Posterior \nreversible \nencephalo-\npathy \nsyndrome \n(PRES) \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Myocardial \ninfarction \nMyocardial \nischaemia \n\n  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nHaemorrhage* \nHypertension \n\n Hypertensive \ncrisis \n\n Aneurysms \nand artery \ndissections \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDysphonia     \n\nGastro-\nintestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea \nStomatitis \nVomiting \nNausea \n\nTaste \ndisorders \nDry mouth \nGastro-\noesopha-\ngeal reflux \nGastro-\nenteritis \n\nGastro-\nintestinal \nperforation* \nGastro-\nintestinal \nfistula \nPancreatitis \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nHyper-\nbilirubinaemia \nIncrease in \ntransaminases \n\n Severe liver \ninjury*# \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n(MedDRA) \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\nHand-foot skin \nreaction** \nRash \n \n\nAlopecia  \nDry skin \nExfoliative \nrash \n\nNail disorder \nErythema \nmultiforme \n\nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome \nToxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n\n \n\nMusculo-\nskeletal and \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n Muscle \nspasms \n\n   \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n Proteinuria    \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nAsthenia/ \nfatigue \nPain  \nFever \nMucosal \ninflammation \n\n    \n\nInvestigations Weight loss Increase in \namylase \nIncrease in \nlipase \nAbnormal \nInter-\nnational \nnormalised \nratio \n\n   \n\n*  fatal cases have been reported \n** palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome in MedDRA terminology \n# according to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) criteria of the international DILI expert working \n\ngroup \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn most cases of severe liver injury, liver dysfunction had an onset within the first 2 months of therapy, \nand was characterized by a hepatocellular pattern of injury with transaminase elevations >20xULN, \nfollowed by bilirubin increase. In clinical trials, a higher incidence of severe liver injury with fatal \noutcome was observed in Japanese patients (~1.5%) treated with Stivarga, compared with non-\nJapanese patients (<0.1%). \n\nIn the placebo-controlled phase III trials, the overall incidence of haemorrhage was 18.2% in patients \ntreated with Stivarga and 9.5% in patients receiving placebo. Most cases of bleeding events in patients \ntreated with Stivarga were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 15.2%), most notably \nepistaxis (6.1%). Fatal outcome in patients treated with Stivarga was uncommon (0.7%), and included \ncerebral, respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary events. \n\nIn the placebo-controlled phase III trials, infections were more often observed in patients treated with \nStivarga, compared to patients receiving placebo (all grades: 31.6% vs. 17.2%). Most infections in \npatients treated with Stivarga were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 23.0%), and included \nurinary tract infections (5.7%), nasopharyngitis (4.0%), mucocutaneous and systemic fungal infections \n(3.3%) as well as pneumonia (2.6%).  Fatal outcomes associated with infection were observed more \n\n\n\n13 \n\noften in patients treated with Stivarga (1.0%), compared to patients receiving placebo (0.3%), and \nwere mainly respiratory events. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled phase III trials, the overall incidence of hand-foot skin reaction was higher in \npatients treated with Stivarga, compared to patients receiving placebo (all grades: 51.4% vs. 6.5% \nCRC, 66.7% vs. 15.2% GIST and 51.6% vs.7.3% HCC). Most cases of hand-foot skin reaction in \npatients treated with Stivarga appeared during the first cycle of treatment and were mild to moderate in \nseverity (Grades 1 and 2: 34.3%%, CRC, 44.7%, GIST and 39.3%, HCC). The incidence of Grade 3 \nhand-foot skin reaction was 17.1% (CRC), 22.0% (GIST) and 12.3% (HCC). The overall incidence of \nhand-foot skin reaction (74.8%, CRC, 88.2%, GIST and 67.1%, HCC) was higher in Stivarga-treated \nAsian patients, compared to other ethnicities. The incidence of Grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction in \nAsians was 20.5% (CRC), 23.5% (GIST) and 13.5% (HCC) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled phase III trials, the overall incidence of hypertension was higher in patients \ntreated with Stivarga, compared to patients receiving placebo (29.6% vs. 7.5% CRC, 60.6% vs. 25.8% \nGIST and 31.0% vs. 6.2% HCC). Most cases of hypertension in patients treated with Stivarga \nappeared during the first cycle of treatment and were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: \n20.9%, CRC,  31.8%, GIST and 15.8% HCC). The incidence of Grade 3 hypertension was 8.7% \n(CRC), 28.0% (GIST) and 15.2% (HCC). One case of Grade 4 hypertension was reported in the GIST \ntrial. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled phase III trials, the overall incidence of treatment emergent proteinuria was \n9.1% in patients treated with Stivarga, compared to 1.9% in patients receiving placebo. Of these \nevents, 35.6% in the Stivarga arm and 54.5% in the placebo arm have been reported as not \nrecovered/not resolved. \nAcross all clinical trials, cardiac disorder events (all grades) have been more often (13.7% vs. 6.5%) \nreported in Stivarga-treated patients aged 75 years or older (N=410), compared to Stivarga-treated \npatients below 75 years (N=4108). \n \nLaboratory test

The most frequently observed \nadverse drug reactions at this dose were dermatological events, dysphonia, diarrhoea, mucosal \ninflammation, dry mouth, decreased appetite, hypertension, and fatigue.  \n \nThere is no specific antidote for Stivarga overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, Stivarga \nshould be discontinued immediately, with best supportive care initiated by a medical professional, and \nthe patient should be observed until clinical stabilisation. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor; ATC Code: L01XE21 \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nRegorafenib is an oral tumour deactivation agent that potently blocks multiple protein kinases, \nincluding kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, RET, \nRAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E), metastasis (VEGFR3, PDGFR, FGFR) and tumour immunity (CSF1R). \nIn particular, regorafenib inhibits mutated KIT, a major oncogenic driver in gastrointestinal stromal \ntumours, and thereby blocks tumour cell proliferation. In preclinical studies regorafenib has \ndemonstrated potent antitumour activity in a broad spectrum of tumour models including colorectal, \ngastrointestinal stromal and hepatocellular tumour models which is likely mediated by its \nanti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects. In addition, regorafenib reduced the levels of tumour \nassociated macrophages and has shown anti-metastatic effects in vivo. Major human metabolites (M-2 \nand M-5) exhibited similar efficacies, compared to regorafenib in in vitro and in vivo models. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nMetastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) \n\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Stivarga have been evaluated in an international, multi-centre, \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (CORRECT) in patients with metastatic \ncolorectal cancer who have progressed after failure of standard therapy. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were Progression-Free \nSurvival (PFS), Objective Tumour Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR).  \n \nIn total, 760 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 160 mg regorafenib (4 tablets Stivarga each \ncontaining 40 mg regorafenib) orally once daily (N=505) plus Best Supportive Care (BSC or matching \nplacebo (N=255) plus BSC for 3 weeks on therapy followed by 1 week off therapy. The mean daily \nregorafenib dose received was 147 mg. \n \nPatients continued therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A pre-planned interim \nanalysis for efficacy was performed when 432 deaths had occurred. The study was un-blinded after \nthis planned interim analysis of OS had crossed the pre-specified efficacy boundary.  \n \nOf the 760 randomised patients, the median age was 61 years, 61% were male, 78% were Caucasian, \nand all patients had baseline ECOG Performance Status (PS of 0 or 1. PS ≥2 was reported during \nStivarga treatment in 11.4% of patients. The median treatment duration and daily dose, as well as the \nrate of dose modification and dose reduction were similar to those observed in patients with a reported \nPS ≥ 2 receiving placebo (8.3%). The majority of patients with PS ≥2 discontinued treatment for \nprogressive disease. The primary site of disease was colon (65%), rectum (29%), or both (6%). A \nKRAS mutation was reported in 57% of patients at study entry. \n \nMost patients (52%) received 3 or fewer previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease. Therapies \nincluded treatment with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if the \npatient was KRAS wild type, an anti-EGFR therapy. \n \nThe addition of Stivarga to BSC resulted in significantly longer survival, compared to placebo plus \nBSC with a p value of 0.005178 from stratified log rank test, a hazard ratio of 0.774 [95% CI 0.636, \n0.942] ) and a median OS of 6.4 months vs. 5.0 months (see Table 5 and Figure 1). PFS was \nsignificantly longer in patients receiving Stivarga plus BSC (hazard ratio: 0.494, p<0.000001, see \nTable 5). The response rate (complete response or partial response) was 1% and 0.4% for Stivarga and \nplacebo treated patients, respectively (p=0.188432, 1-sided). The DCR (complete response or partial \nresponse or stable disease) was significantly higher in patients treated with Stivarga (41.0% vs. 14.9%, \np<0.000001, 1 sided). \n \n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 5: Efficacy results from the CORRECT study \n\nEfficacy \nparameter \n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI) \n\nP-value \n(one-sided) \n\nMedian (95% CI) \n\nStivarga plus BSC§ \n(N=505) \n\nPlacebo plus BSC§ \n(N=255) \n\nOS  \n  \n\n0.774  \n(0.636, 0.942) \n\n0.005178 6.4 months \n(5.9, 7.3) \n\n5.0 months \n(4.4, 5.8) \n\nPFS** 0.494  \n(0.419, 0.582) \n\n<0.000001 1.9 months \n(1.9, 2.1) \n\n1.7 months \n(1.7, 1.7) \n\n§ BSC Supportive Care \n* Hazard ratio < 1 favours Stivarga \n** based on investigator’s assessment of tumour response \n \nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of OS  \n\n \n \nSubgroup analyses for OS and PFS according to age (<65; ≥65), gender, ECOG PS, primary site of \ndisease, time from first diagnosis of metastatic disease, prior anticancer treatment, prior treatment lines \nfor metastatic disease, and KRAS mutation status showed a treatment effect favouring the regorafenib \nregimen over the placebo regimen. \n \nSubgroup analysis results by historical KRAS mutational status showed a treatment effect for OS in \nfavour of regorafenib over placebo for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours whereas a numerically \nlower effect was reported in patients with KRAS mutant tumours; the treatment effect for PFS \nfavouring regorafenib was observed regardless of KRAS mutational status. The hazard ratio (95% CI) \nof OS was 0.653 (0.476 to 0.895) for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours and 0.867 (0.670 to \n1.123) for patients with KRAS mutant tumours, with no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect \n(non-significant interaction test). The hazard ratio (95% CI) of PFS was 0.475 (0.362 to 0.623) for \npatients with KRAS wild-type tumours and 0.525 (0.425 to 0.649) for patients with KRAS mutant \ntumours. \n \nA second phase III, international, multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study \n(CONCUR) evaluated the efficacy and safety of Stivarga in 204 pre-treated Asian patients (> 90% \nEast Asian) with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after failure of fluoropyrimidine-\nbased chemotherapy. Only 59.5 % of patients enrolled in the CONCUR study were also previously \n\n\n\n18 \n\ntreated with VEGF- or EGFR-targeted agents. The primary efficacy endpoint was OS. The addition of \nStivarga to BSC resulted in a significantly longer survival, compared to placebo plus BSC with a \nhazard ratio of 0.550 (p = 0.000159 stratified log rank test) and a median OS of 8.8 months vs. 6.3 \nmonths [95% CI 0.395, 0.765]. PFS was also significantly longer in patients receiving Stivarga plus \nBSC (hazard ratio: 0.311, p<0.000001), median PFS 3.2 months with Stivarga vs. 1.7 months with \nplacebo. The safety profile of Stivarga plus BSC in the CONCUR study was consistent with the safety \nprofile observed in the CORRECT study.  \n \nGastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) \n\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Stivarga have been evaluated in an international, multi-centre, \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (GRID) in patients with gastrointestinal \nstromal tumours (GIST) previously treated with 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and sunitinib).  \n\nThe analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was conducted after \n144 PFS events (central blinded assessment). Secondary endpoints including Time To Progression \n(TTP) and Overall Survival (OS (interim analysis) were also assessed.  \n\nIn total, 199 patients with GIST were randomised 2:1 to receive either 160 mg regorafenib plus Best \nSupportive Care (BSC) (N=133) orally once daily or matching placebo plus BSC (N=66) for 3 weeks \non therapy followed by 1 week off therapy. The mean daily regorafenib dose received was 140 mg.  \n\nPatients continued therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving \nplacebo who experienced disease progression were offered open-label regorafenib (cross-over option). \nPatients receiving regorafenib who experienced disease progression and for whom in the investigator’s \nopinion, treatment with regorafenib was providing clinical benefit, were offered the opportunity to \ncontinue open-label regorafenib. \n\nOf the 199 randomised patients, the mean age was 58 years, 64% were male, 68% were Caucasian, \nand all patients had baseline ECOG Performance Status (PS of 0 or 1. The overall median time since \nmost recent progression or relapse to randomisation was 6 weeks.  \n\nRegorafenib plus BSC resulted in significantly longer PFS, compared to placebo plus BSC with a \nhazard ratio of 0.268 [95% CI 0.185, 0.388] and a median PFS of 4.8 months vs. 0.9 months (p < \n0.000001). The relative risk of disease progression or death was reduced by approximately 73.2% in \nregorafenib-treated patients, compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 6, Figure 2).The increase \nin PFS was consistent independent of age, sex, geographic region, prior lines of treatment, ECOG PS.  \n\nTTP was significantly longer in patients receiving regorafenib plus BSC than in patients receiving \nplacebo plus BSC with a hazard ratio of 0.248 [95% CI 0.170, 0.364], and median TTP of 5.4 months \nvs. 0.9 months (p<0.000001) (see Table 6). \n \nThe HR for OS was 0.772 (95% CI, 0.423, 1.408; p = 0.199; median OS not reached in either arm); \n85% of patients initially randomised to the placebo arm received post-progression treatment with \nregorafenib (see Table 6, Figure 3). \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nTable 6: Efficacy results from the GRID study \n\nEfficacy \nparameter \n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI) \n\nP-value \n(one-sided) \n\nMedian (95% CI) \n\nStivarga plus \nBSC§ \n\n(N=133) \n\nPlacebo plus \nBSC§ \n\n(N=66) \nPFS  0.268  \n\n(0.185, 0.388)  \n<0.000001 4.8 months \n\n(4.0, 5.7) \n0.9  months \n(0.9, 1.1) \n\nTTP 0.248 \n(0.170,0.364) \n\n<0.000001 5.4 months \n(4.1, 5.7) \n\n0.9  months \n(0.9, 1.1) \n\nOS 0.772  \n(0.423, 1.408) \n\n0.199 NR** NR** \n\n§ Best Supportive Care \n* Hazard ratio < 1 favours Stivarga \n** NR: not reached \n \n \nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS \n\n \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS \n\n \n\n \n \nIn addition, 56 placebo plus BSC patients received open-label Stivarga after cross-over following \ndisease progression and a total of 41 Stivarga plus BSC patients continued Stivarga treatment after \ndisease progression. The median secondary PFS (as measured by the investigator’s assessment) were \n5.0 and 4.5 months, respectively. \n \nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \n\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Stivarga have been evaluated in an international, multi-centre, \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (RESORCE) in patients with \nhepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were Progression-Free \nSurvival (PFS), Time To Progression (TTP), Objective Tumour Response Rate (ORR) and Disease \nControl Rate (DCR). \n \nIn total, 573 patients with HCC were randomised 2:1 to receive either 160 mg regorafenib orally once \ndaily (n=379) plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) or matching placebo (n=194) plus BSC for 3 weeks on \ntherapy followed by 1 week off therapy. The mean daily regorafenib dose received was 144 mg. \nPatients were eligible to participate in the study if they experienced radiological disease progression \nduring treatment with sorafenib and if they had a liver function status of Child-Pugh class A. Patients \nwho permanently discontinued sorafenib therapy due to sorafenib-related toxicity or who tolerated less \nthan 400 mg sorafenib once daily prior to withdrawal were excluded from the study. Randomisation \nwas performed within 10 weeks after the last treatment with sorafenib. Patients continued therapy with \nStivarga until clinical or radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, patients \ncould continue Stivarga therapy past progression at the discretion of the investigator. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nDemographics and baseline disease characteristics were comparable between the Stivarga- and \nplacebo-treated groups and are shown below for all 573 randomised patients: \n• Median age: 63 years \n• Male: 88% \n• Caucasian: 36%, Asian: 41% \n• ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0: 66% or ECOG PS of 1: 34% \n• Child-Pugh A: 98%, Child-Pugh B: 2% \n• Aetiology included Hepatitis B (38%), Hepatitis C (21%), Non-Alcoholic Steato Hepatitis \n\n(NASH, 7%) \n• Absence of both macroscopic vascular invasion and extra-hepatic tumour spread: 19%  \n• Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B: 13%; BCLC stage C: 87% \n• Loco-regional transarterial embolisation or chemoinfusion procedures: 61% \n• Radiotherapy prior to regorafenib treatment: 15% \n• Median duration of sorafenib treatment: 7.8 months  \n \nThe addition of Stivarga to BSC resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to \nplacebo plus BSC with a hazard ratio of 0.624 [95% CI 0.498, 0.782], p=0.000017 stratified log rank \ntest, and a median OS of 10.6 months vs. 7.8 months (see Table 7 and Figure 4). \n \n \nTable 7: Efficacy results from the RESORCE study \n \n\nEfficacy \nparameter \n\nHazard ratio* \n(95% CI) \n\nP-value \n(one-sided) \n\nMedian (95% CI) \n\nStivarga plus BSC§ \n(N=379) \n\nPlacebo plus BSC§ \n(N=194) \n\nOS  \n \n\n0.624 \n(0.498,0.782) \n\n0.000017 10.6 months \n(9.1, 12.1) \n\n7.8 months \n(6.3, 8.8) \n\nPFS** 0.453  \n(0.369, 0.555) \n\n<0.000001 3.1 months \n(2.8, 4.2) \n\n1.5 months \n(1.4, 1.6) \n\nTTP** 0.439 \n(0.355,0.542) \n\n<0.000001 3.2 months \n(2.9, 4.2) \n\n1.5 months \n(1.4, 1.6) \n\n   Percentages \n \n\nORR**# NA 0.003650 11% 4% \nDCR **# NA <0.000001 65% 36% \n§   Best Supportive Care \n*   Hazard ratio < 1 favours Stivarga  \n**  based on investigator’s assessment of tumour response by modified RECIST \n# Response rate (complete or partial response), DCR  (complete response,  partial response and \nstable disease maintained for 6 weeks) \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nFigure 4: Kaplan-Meier curve of OS  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nFigure 5: Kaplan-Meier curve of PFS (mRECIST) \n \n\n \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nStivarga in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the colon and \nrectum (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nStivarga in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of solid malignant \ntumours (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nStivarga in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nRegorafenib reaches mean peak plasma levels of about 2.5 mg/l at about 3 to 4 hours after a single oral \ndose of 160 mg given as 4 tablets each containing 40 mg. Following single doses of 60 mg or 100 mg, \nthe average relative bioavailability of tablets compared to an oral solution was 69% and 83%, \nrespectively. \n \nThe concentrations of regorafenib and its major pharmacologically active metabolites (M-2 and M-5) \nwere highest when given after a low-fat (light) breakfast, compared to either a high-fat breakfast or \nfasting condition. The exposure for regorafenib was increased by 48% when administered with a \nhigh-fat breakfast, and 36% when administered with a low fat breakfast, compared to fasting. The \nexposure of metabolites M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl) is higher when \nregorafenib is given with a low fat breakfast, compared to fasting condition and lower when given \nwith a high fat meal, compared to fasting condition. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nDistribution \nPlasma concentration-time profiles for regorafenib as well as for the major circulating metabolites \nshowed multiple peaks across the 24-hour dosing interval, which are attributed to enterohepatic \ncirculation. In vitro protein binding of regorafenib to human plasma proteins is high (99.5%). In vitro \nprotein binding of M-2 and M-5 is higher (99.8% and 99.95%, respectively) than that of regorafenib. \nMetabolites M-2 and M-5 are weak substrates of P-gp. Metabolite M-5 is a weak BCRP-substrate. \n \nBiotransformation \nRegorafenib is metabolized primarily in the liver by oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, as \nwell as by glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. Two major and six minor metabolites of \nregorafenib have been identified in plasma. The main circulating metabolites of regorafenib in human \nplasma are M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl), which are pharmacologically active \nand have similar concentrations as regorafenib at steady state. M-2 is further metabolised by oxidative \nmetabolism mediated by CYP3A4, as well as by glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. \n \nMetabolites may be reduced or hydrolysed in the gastrointestinal tract by microbial flora, allowing \nreabsorption of the unconjugated active substance and metabolites (enterohepatic circulation). \n \nElimination \nFollowing oral administration, mean elimination half-life for regorafenib and its metabolite M-2 in \nplasma ranges from 20 to 30 hours in different studies. The mean elimination half-life for the \nmetabolite M-5 is approximately 60 hours (range from 40 to 100 hours).  \nApproximately 90% of the radioactive dose was recovered within 12 days after administration, with \nabout 71% of the dose excreted in faeces (47% as parent compound, 24% as metabolites), and about \n19% of the dose excreted in urine as glucuronides. Urinary excretion of glucuronides decreased below \n10% under steady-state conditions. Parent compound found in faeces could be derived from intestinal \ndegradation of glucuronides or reduction of metabolite M-2 (N-oxide), as well as unabsorbed \nregorafenib. \nM-5 may be reduced to M-4 in the gastrointestinal tract by microbial flora, allowing reabsorption of \nM-4 (enterohepatic circulation). M-5 is finally excreted via M-4 as M-6 (carboxylic acid) in faeces. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nSystemic exposure of regorafenib at steady-state increases dose proportionally up to 60 mg and less \nthan proportionally at doses greater than 60 mg. Accumulation of regorafenib at steady state results in \nabout a 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations, which is consistent with the elimination half-life and \ndosing frequency. At steady state, regorafenib reaches mean peak plasma levels of about 3.9 mg/L \n(8.1 micromolar) after oral administration of 160 mg regorafenib and the peak-to-trough ratio of mean \nplasma concentrations is less than 2. \nBoth metabolites, M-2 and M-5, exhibit non-linear accumulation, which might be caused by entero-\nhepatic recycling or saturation of the UGT1A9 pathway. Whereas plasma concentrations of M-2 and \nM-5 after a single dose of regorafenib are much lower than those of parent compound, steady-state \nplasma concentrations of M-2 and M-5 are comparable to those of regorafenib. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe exposure of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 is comparable in patients with mild \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and patients with normal hepatic function. \nLimited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) indicate similar exposure, \ncompared to patients with normal hepatic function after a single 100 mg dose of regorafenib. There are \nno data for patients with Child-Pugh C (severe) hepatic impairment. Regorafenib is mainly eliminated \nvia the liver, and exposure might be increased in this patient population. \n \nRenal impairment \nAvailable clinical data and physiology-based pharmacokinetic modelling indicate similar steady-state \nexposure of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 in patients with mild or moderate renal \n\n\n\n25 \n\nimpairment, compared to patients with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment \ncompared to patients with normal renal function, regorafenib exposure was similar while exposure to \nM-2 and M-5 was decreased by about 30% under steady-state conditions, which is not considered \nclinically relevant. \nThe pharmacokinetics of regorafenib has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. \nHowever, physiology-based pharmacokinetic modelling does not predict any relevant change in \nexposure in these patients. \n \nElderly \nAge did not affect the regorafenib pharmacokinetics over the studied age range (29 – 85 years). \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of regorafenib is not influenced by gender. \n \nEthnic differences \nThe exposure of regorafenib in various Asian populations (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is within the \nsame range as seen in Caucasians. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology/QT prolongation \nNo QTc prolonging effects were observed after administration of 160 mg regorafenib at steady state in \na dedicated QT study in male and female cancer patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic toxicity \nAfter repeated dosing to mice, rats and dogs, adverse effects were observed in a number of organs, \nprimarily in the kidneys, liver, digestive tract, thyroid gland, lympho-/haematopoietic system, \nendocrine system, reproductive system and skin. A slightly increased incidence of thickening of the \natrioventricular valves of the heart was seen in the 26 week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. This \nmay be due to acceleration of an age-related physiological process. These effects occurred at systemic \nexposures in the range of or below the anticipated human exposure (based on AUC comparison).  \nAlterations of teeth and bones and adverse effects in the reproductive system were more pronounced in \nyoung and growing animals as well as in juvenile rats and indicate a potential risk for children and \nadolescents. \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity \nSpecific studies on fertility have not been performed. However, a potential of regorafenib to adversely \naffect male and female reproduction has to be considered based on morphological changes in the \ntestes, ovaries, and the uterus observed after repeated dosing in rats and dogs at exposures below the \nanticipated human exposure (based on AUC comparison). The observed changes were only partially \nreversible. \n \nAn effect of regorafenib on intrauterine development was shown in rabbits at exposures below the \nanticipated human exposure (based on AUC comparison). Main findings consisted of malformations \nof the urinary system, the heart and major vessels, and the skeleton. \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \nThere was no indication for a genotoxic potential of regorafenib tested in standard assays in vitro and \nin vivo in mice. \n \nStudies on the carcinogenic potential of regorafenib have not been performed. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that regorafenib has the potential to be persistent, \nbioaccumulative and toxic to the environment and may pose a risk to the surface water and to the \nsediment compartment (see section 6.6). \n \n \n6.
