NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nStriascan 74 MBq/mL solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 74 MBq of ioflupane (123I) at reference time (0.07 to 0.13 µg/mL of \n\nioflupane). \n\n \n\nEach 2.5 mL single dose vial contains 185 MBq ioflupane (123I) (specific activity range 2.5 to \n\n4.5 x 1014 Bq/mmol) at reference time. \n\nEach 5 mL single dose vial contains 370 MBq ioflupane (123I) (specific activity range 2.5 to \n\n4.5 x 1014 Bq/mmol) at reference time. \n\n \n\nIodine-123 has a physical half-life of 13.2 hours. It decays emitting gamma radiation with a predominant \n\nenergy of 159 keV and X-rays of 27 keV. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\nThis medicinal product contains 39.5 g/L ethanol.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\nClear colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n\nStriascan is indicated for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum: \n\n• In adult patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndromes, for example those with early \nsymptoms, in order to help differentiate essential tremor from parkinsonian syndromes related to \n\nidiopathic Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. \n\nStriascan is unable to discriminate between Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and \n\nprogressive supranuclear palsy. \n\n• In adult patients, to help differentiate probable dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer’s \ndisease. Striascan is unable to discriminate between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s \n\ndisease dementia. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nStriascan should only be used in adult patients referred by physicians experienced in the management of \n\nmovement disorders and/or dementia.  \n\n \n\nThis medical product is for use in hospitals or in designated nuclear medicine facilities only. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n\nClinical efficacy has been demonstrated across the range 110 to 185 MBq. Do not exceed 185 MBq and \n\ndo not use when the activity is below 110 MBq. \n\n \n\nPatients must undergo appropriate thyroid blocking treatment prior to injection to minimise thyroid \n\nuptake of radioactive iodine, for example by oral administration of approximately 120 mg potassium \n\niodide 1 to 4 hours prior to injection of Striascan.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nFormal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. No data \n\nare available (see section 4.4).  \n\nCareful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation exposure \n\nis possible in these patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Striascan in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years has not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nStriascan is for intravenous use. \n\n \n\nFor patient preparation, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product  \n\nStriascan should be used without dilution. To minimise the potential for pain at the injection site during \n\nadministration, a slow intravenous injection (not less than 15 to 20 seconds) via an arm vein is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nImage acquisition \n\nSPECT imaging should take place between three and six hours post-injection.  \n\nImages should be acquired using a gamma camera fitted with a high-resolution collimator and calibrated \n\nusing the 159 keV photopeak and a ± 10% energy window. Angular sampling should preferably be not \n\nless than 120 views over 360 degrees.  \n\nFor high resolution collimators the radius of rotation should be consistent and set as small as possible \n\n(typically 11-15 cm). Experimental studies with a striatal phantom, suggest that optimal images are \n\nobtained with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of 3.5-4.5 mm for those systems \n\ncurrently in use. A minimum of 500 k counts should be collected for optimal images. Normal images are \n\ncharacterised by two symmetrical crescent-shaped areas of equal intensity. Abnormal images are either \n\nasymmetric or symmetric with unequal intensity and/or loss of crescent. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPotential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions \n\nIf hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate action in \n\nemergencies, the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube and ventilator \n\nmust be immediately available. \n\n \n\nIndividual benefit/risk justification \n\nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered \n\nshould in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required diagnostic information. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment / Hepatic impairment \n\nFormal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. In the \n\nabsence of data, Striascan is not recommended in cases of moderate to severe renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\nCareful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \n\nexposure is possible. \n\n \n\nPatient preparation  \n\nThe patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void as often as \n\npossible during the first hours after the examination in order to reduce radiation. \n\n \n\nSpecific warnings \n\nThis medicinal product contains 39.5 g/L (5% volume) ethanol (alcohol), up to 197 mg per dose, \n\nequivalent to 5 mL beer or 2 mL wine. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be taken into \n\naccount in high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’.  \n\n \n\nPrecautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n\nIoflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Active substances that bind to the dopamine transporter with \n\nhigh affinity may therefore interfere with Striascan diagnosis. These include: \n\n- amfetamine, \n- benzatropine,  \n- bupropion,  \n- cocaine,  \n- mazindol,  \n- methylphenidate,  \n- phentermine and  \n- sertraline. \n\n \n\nActive substances shown during clinical trials not to interfere with Striascan imaging include: \n\n- amantadine,  \n- trihexyphenidyl,  \n- budipine,  \n- levodopa,  \n- metoprolol,  \n- primidone,  \n- propranolol and  \n- selegiline.  \n \n\nDopamine agonists and antagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expected to \n\ninterfere with Striascan imaging and can therefore be continued if desired. Medicinal products shown in \n\nanimal studies not to interfere with Striascan imaging include pergolide. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \n\nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \n\nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIf in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very \n\nirregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to \n\nthe patient. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAnimal reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with this product.  \n\nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. \n\nAdministration of 185 MBq of ioflupane (123I) results in an absorbed dose to the uterus of 2.6 mGy. \n\nStriascan is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIt is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is excreted in human milk. Before administering \n\nradiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to the possibility \n\nof delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breastfeeding, and to what is \n\nthe most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity in breast \n\nmilk. \n\nIf administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be interrupted for 3 days and substituted \n\nby formula feeding. During this time, breast milk should be expressed at regular intervals and the \n\nexpressed feeds should be discarded. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo fertility studies have been performed. No data are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nStriascan has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe following undesirable effects are recognised for ioflupane (123I). \n\n \n\nVery common  (1/10) \n\nCommon  (1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon  (1/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nRare  (1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \n\nVery rare  (<1/10,000) \n\nNot known  (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA Body system  \n\nSOCs \n\nAdverse reaction \n\nPreferred term \n\nFrequency \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity Not known \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\nAppetite increased Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n \n\nHeadache Common \n\nDizziness, formication \n\n(paraesthesia), dysgeusia \n\nUncommon \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\n \n\nVertigo Uncommon \n\nVascular disorders \n\n \n\nBlood pressure decreased \n\n \n\nNot known \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders  \n\n \n\nDyspnea Not known \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nNausea, dry mouth \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\n \n\nVomiting Not known \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\nErythema, pruritus, rash, \n\nurticaria, hyperhidrosis \n\nNot known \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site pain (intense pain \n\nor burning sensation following \n\nadministration into small veins) \n\nUncommon \n\nFeeling hot Not known  \n\n \n\n \n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \n\nhereditary defects. As the effective dose is 4.6 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 185 MBq \n\nis administered these adverse events are expected to occur with a low probability. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn the event of administration of a radiation overdose, frequent micturition and defaecation should be \n\nencouraged in order to minimise radiation dose to the patient. Care should be taken to avoid \n\ncontamination from the radioactivity eliminated by the patient using such methods. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceutical central nervous system, \n\nATC code: V09AB03. \n\n \n\nAt the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, Striascan does not appear to have any \n\npharmacodynamic activity. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIoflupane is a cocaine analogue. Studies in animals have shown that ioflupane binds with high affinity to \n\nthe presynaptic dopamine transporter and so radiolabelled ioflupane (123I) can be used as a surrogate \n\nmarker to examine the integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Ioflupane also binds to the \n\nserotonin transporter on 5-HT neurons but with lower (approximately 10-fold) binding affinity. \n\nThere is no experience in types of tremor other than essential tremor. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nClinical studies in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. \n\nIn a clinical trial including evaluation of 288 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) \n\n(144 subjects), Alzheimer’s disease (124 subjects), vascular dementia (9 subjects) or other (11 subjects), \n\nthe results of an independent, blinded visual assessment of the ioflupane (123I) images were compared to \n\nthe clinical diagnosis as determined by physicians experienced in the management and diagnosis of \n\ndementias. Clinical categorisation into the respective dementia group was based on a standardised and \n\ncomprehensive clinical and neuropsychiatric evaluation. The values for the sensitivity of ioflupane (123I) \n\nin determining probable DLB from non-DLB ranged from 75.0% to 80.2% and specificity from 88.6% to \n\n91.4%. The positive predictive value ranged from 78.9% to 84.4% and the negative predictive value from \n\n86.1% to 88.7%. Analyses in which both possible and probable DLB patients were compared with non-\n\nDLB dementia patients demonstrated values for the sensitivity of ioflupane (123I) ranging from 75.0% to \n\n80.2% and specificity from 81.3% to 83.9% when the possible DLB patients were included as non-DLB \n\npatients. The sensitivity ranged from 60.6% to 63.4% and specificity from 88.6% to 91.4% when the \n\npossible DLB patients were included as DLB patients. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nIoflupane (123I) is cleared rapidly from the blood after intravenous injection; only 5% of the administered \n\nactivity remains in whole blood at 5 minutes post-injection. \n\n \n\nOrgan uptake \n\nUptake in the brain is rapid, reaching about 7% of injected activity at 10 minutes post-injection and \n\ndecreasing to 3% after 5 hours. About 30% of the whole brain activity is attributed to striatal uptake. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nAt 48 hours post-injection, approximately 60% of the injected radioactivity is excreted in the urine, with \n\nfaecal excretion calculated at approximately 14%. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data for ioflupane reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \n\nsafety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\nStudies on reproductive toxicity and to assess the carcinogenic potential of ioflupane have not been \n\nperformed. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \n\n \n\nAfter use, all materials associated with the preparation and administration of radiopharmaceuticals, \n\nincluding any unused product and its container, should be decontaminated or treated as radioactive waste \n\nand disposed of in accordance with the conditions specified by the local competent authority. \n\nContaminated material must be disposed of as radioactive waste via an authorised route. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n6.

DOSIMETRY \n\n \n\nThe biokinetic model for ioflupane (123I) adopted by ICRP 128 ((International Commission on \n\nRadiological Protection ,2015) assumes initial uptake of 31% of the administered activity in the liver, \n\n11% in the lungs, and 4% in the brain. The rest is assumed to be distributed uniformly in the remaining \n\norgans and tissues. For all organs and tissues, 80% is assumed to be excreted with a biological half-time \n\nof 58 h, and 20% with a half-time of 1.6 h. It is further assumed that 60% of the injected activity is \n\nexcreted to the urine, and 40% is excreted to the gastrointestinal tract for all organs and tissues. Activity \n\nin the liver is excreted according to the Publication 53 gallbladder model (ICRP, 1987), where 30% is \n\neliminated via the gallbladder and the remainder passes directly into the small intestine.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average adult patient (70 kg) from intravenous injection of \n\nioflupane (123I) are listed below according to ICRP 128.  \n\nThe values are calculated assuming urinary bladder emptying at 4.8-hour intervals and appropriate \n\nthyroid blocking (Iodine-123 is a known Auger electron emitter) \n\n \n\nOrgan  Absorbed radiation dose \n\nµGy/MBq \n\nAdrenals 17 \n\nBone surfaces 15 \n\nBrain 16 \n\nBreasts 7.3 \n\nGallbladder wall 44 \n\nGastrointestinal tract  \n\nStomach wall 12 \n\nSmall intestine wall 26 \n\nColon wall 59 \n\n(Upper large intestine wall ) 57 \n\n(Lower large intestine wall) 62 \n\nHeart wall 32 \n\nKidneys 13 \n\nLiver 85 \n\nLungs 42 \n\nMuscle 8.9 \n\nOesophagus 9.4 \n\nOvaries 18.0 \n\nPancreas 17.0 \n\nRed marrow 9.3 \n\nSalivary glands 41.0 \n\nSkin 5.2 \n\nSpleen 26.0 \n\nTestes 6.3 \n\nThymus 9.4 \n\nThyroid 6.7 \n\nUrinary bladder wall 35.0 \n\nUterus 14.0 \n\nRemaining organs 10.0 \n\nEffective Dose 25.0 µSv/MBq \n\n \n\nThe effective dose (E) resulting from administration of 185 MBq of Striascan injection is 4.6 mSv (per \n\n70 kg individual). The above data are valid in normal pharmacokinetic behaviour. When renal or hepatic \n\nfunction is impaired, the effective dose and the radiation dose delivered to organs might be increased. \n\nFor an administered activity of 185 MBq the typical radiation dose to the target organ (brain) is 3 mGy \n\nand the typical radiation doses to the critical organs: liver and colon wall are 16 mGy and 11 mGy, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n12.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Striascan is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before Striascan is used \n\n3. How Striascan is used \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How Striascan is stored  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Striascan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only.  \n\n \n\nStriascan contains the active substance ioflupane (123I) which is used to help identify (diagnose) \n\nconditions in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called “radiopharmaceuticals”, which contain a \n\nsmall amount of radioactivity. \n\n• When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body \nfor a short time. \n\n• Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body \nusing special cameras. \n\n• A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the \nradioactivity is inside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information \n\nabout how that organ is working. \n\n \n\nStriascan is used only to identify illness. When this medicine is injected into a patient, it is carried around \n\nthe body in the blood and collects in a small area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in: \n\n \n\n• parkinsonism (including Parkinson’s disease) and \n\n• dementia with Lewy bodies. \n \n\nA scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may \n\nfeel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible treatment. \n\n \n\nWhen Striascan is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than in \n\nsome types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the \n\nclinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to \n\nthese small amounts of radiation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n2. What you need to know before Striascan is used \n\n \n\nStriascan must not be used \n\n• if you are allergic to ioflupane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\n• if you are pregnant. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using this medicine if you have moderate or severe \n\nproblems with your kidneys or liver. \n\n \n\nBefore administration of Striascan you should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination \n\nin order to urinate as often as possible during the first hours after the study.   \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nStriascan is not recommended for children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Striascan \n\nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. \n\nSome medicines or substances can affect the way that this medicine works. \n\nThese include: \n\n \n\n• bupropion (used to treat depression (sadness)) \n\n• benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson’s disease) \n\n• mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity) \n\n• sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)) \n\n• methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive \nsleepiness)) \n\n• phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity) \n\n• amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); \nalso a drug of abuse) \n\n• cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a drug of abuse) \n \n\nSome medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking \n\nthem for a short time before you receive Striascan. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\nnuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\n \n\nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Striascan if there is a \n\npossibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.  \n\nWhen in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant, do not use Striascan. This is because the child may receive some of the \n\nradioactivity.  Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity should be considered. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of this product or ask you to \n\nstop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) you are given is passed into breast milk. \n\n• You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after this product is given. \n\n• Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away \nany breast milk you have expressed. \n\n• You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your \nbody. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIt is considered unlikely that Striascan will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nStriascan contains alcohol (ethanol) 5 % by volume. Each dose contains up to 197 mg alcohol. This is \n\nabout the same as 5 mL beer, or 2 mL wine. This is harmful for those suffering from alcoholism and \n\nneeds to be taken into account in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \n\npatients with liver disease or epilepsy. Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Striascan is used \n\n \n\nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity. Striascan will always be used in a \n\nhospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and \n\nqualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of this medicine. \n\nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Striascan to be used \n\nin your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.  \n\nThe quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 110 to 185 MBq \n\n(megabecquerel or MBq, the unit used to measure radioactivity). \n\n \n\nAdministration of Striascan and conduct of the procedure \n\nBefore you receive Striascan, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid that \n\ncontain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that you take \n\nthe tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. \n\n \n\nStriascan is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. A single injection is enough.  \n\n \n\nDuration of the procedure  \n\nThe camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours after the injection of this product. Your nuclear \n\nmedicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. \n\n \n\nAfter administration of Striascan, you should urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from \n\nyour body.  \n\n \n\nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving \n\nthis medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Striascan than you should \n\nSince this product is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an \n\noverdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get \n\nrid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell \n\nyou what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like Striascan. Any ioflupane (123I) which remains \n\nin your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who \n\nsupervises the procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
