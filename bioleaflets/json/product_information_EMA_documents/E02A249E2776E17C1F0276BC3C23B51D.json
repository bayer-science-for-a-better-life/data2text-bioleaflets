NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAmbirix, suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nHepatitis A (inactivated) and hepatitis B (rDNA) (HAB) vaccine (adsorbed). \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (1 ml) contains: \n \nHepatitis A virus (inactivated)1,2 720 ELISA Units \nHepatitis B surface antigen3,4 20 micrograms \n \n1Produced on human diploid (MRC-5) cells \n2Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.05 milligrams Al3+ \n3Produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology \n4Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.4 milligrams Al3+ \n  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nAmbirix is a turbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAmbirix is indicated in non-immune children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 \nyears of age for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection. \n \nProtection against hepatitis B infections may not be obtained until after the second dose (see section \n5.1).  \nTherefore: \n- Ambirix should be used only when there is a relatively low risk of hepatitis B infection during \n\nthe vaccination course.  \n- It is recommended that Ambirix should be administered in settings where completion of the \n\ntwo-dose vaccination course can be assured. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n- Dosage \n \nA dose of 1.0 ml is recommended for subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age. \n \n- Primary vaccination schedule \n \nThe standard primary course of vaccination consists of two doses, the first administered at the elected \ndate and the second between 6 and 12 months after the first dose.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe recommended schedule should be adhered to. Once initiated, the primary course of vaccination \nshould be completed with the same vaccine. \n \n- Booster dose \n \nIn situations where a booster dose of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B is desired, a monovalent or \ncombined vaccine can be given. The safety and immunogenicity of Ambirix administered as a booster \ndose following a two dose primary course have not been evaluated. \n \nLong-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Ambirix are available up to 15 years \nafter vaccination (see section 5.1). \n \nThe anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody titres \nobserved following a primary vaccination course with Ambirix are in the range of what is seen \nfollowing vaccination with the monovalent hepatitis A and B vaccines. General guidelines for booster \nvaccination can therefore be drawn from experience with the monovalent vaccines, as follows.   \n\n \nHepatitis B \n\n \nThe need for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals who have received a full \nprimary vaccination course has not been established. However some official vaccination programmes \ncurrently include a recommendation for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and these should be \nrespected. \n \nFor some categories of subjects at risk of exposure to HBV (e.g. haemodialysis or \nimmunocompromised patients) a precautionary attitude should be considered to ensure that a \nprotective antibody level ≥ 10 mIU/ml is maintained. \n\n \nHepatitis A \n\n \nIt is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis \nA vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be \nensured by immunological memory. Guidelines for boosting are based on the assumption that \nantibodies are required for protection.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Ambirix in children aged less than 1 year have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAmbirix is for intramuscular injection, usually into the deltoid muscle. However the anterolateral \nthigh may be used in very young subjects if preferred. \n \nExceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or \nbleeding disorders. However, this route of administration may result in suboptimal immune response \nto the vaccine (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or neomycin. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Ambirix should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute severe febrile illness. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a \npsychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs \nsuch as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It \nis important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nIt is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection at \nthe time of vaccination. It is not known whether Ambirix will prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B in \nsuch cases. \n \nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis C and hepatitis E and \nother pathogens known to infect the liver. \n \nAmbirix is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (e.g. needle stick injury). \n \nIf rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard three-dose regimen of the combined \nvaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of \nrecombinant hepatitis B surface antigen is recommended. This is because, a higher proportion of \nsubjects are protected in the interval between the second and third dose of the three-dose combined \nvaccine, than after a single dose of Ambirix. This difference is no longer present after the second dose \nof Ambirix (see section 5.1 for seroprotection rates). \n \nIt is recommended that the two-dose regimen of Ambirix be completed prior to start of sexual activity. \n \nThe vaccine has not been tested in patients with an impaired immune system. In haemodialysis \npatients and persons with an impaired immune system, adequate anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody \ntiters may not be obtained after the primary immunisation course. \n \nSince intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a \nsuboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided. However, exceptionally Ambirix \ncan be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders since \nbleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nAmbirix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo data on concomitant administration of Ambirix with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or \nhepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated. However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and \nhepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins there was no \neffect on seroconversion rates. Concomitant immunoglobulin administration may result in lower \nantibody titres. \n \nWhen Ambirix was administered concomitantly with, but as a separate injection to a combined \ndiphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b \n\n\n\n5 \n\nvaccine (DTPa-IPV+Hib) or with a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of \nlife, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory (see section 5.1). \n \nConcomitant administration of Ambirix and other vaccines than those listed above has not been \nstudied. It is advised that Ambirix should not be administered at the same time as other vaccines \nunless absolutely necessary.  \nConcomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably into \ndifferent limbs. \n \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with \nimmunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAmbirix can be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed, and the possible advantages \noutweigh the potential risks for the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAmbirix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the \npotential risks. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAmbirix has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nClinical trials involved the administration of 2029 doses of Ambirix to 1027 subjects from 1 year up \nto and including 15 years of age.  \nIn 2 comparative trials in subjects aged 1-15 years, the incidences of local and general solicited \nsymptoms after a two-dose regimen of Ambirix was overall similar to that seen with the three-dose \ncombined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of HAV and 10 µg of HBsAg. \n\n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions following Ambirix administration are pain and fatigue \noccurring in an approximated per dose frequency of 50% and 30% respectively. \n  \nList of adverse reactions \n \nLocal and general adverse reactions reported following primary vaccination with Ambirix were \ncategorised by frequency.   \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery common: ≥ 1/10 \nCommon: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nRare:  ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000 \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVery rare: <

of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n \nCases of overdose with GlaxoSmithKline’s combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine have been \nreported during post-marketing surveillance. Adverse reactions reported following overdosage were \nsimilar to those reported with normal vaccine administration. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco therapeutic group: Vaccines, Hepatitis vaccines, ATC code J07BC20. \n \nMechanism of action \nAmbirix confers immunity against HAV and HBV infection by inducing specific anti-HAV and anti-\nHBs antibodies. \n \nClinical studies \n\nImmune responses post-primary vaccination \nIn clinical studies involving subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years old, seropositivity rates \nfor anti-HAV antibodies were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% after the second dose \ngiven at month 6 (i.e month 7). Seropositivity rates for anti-HBs antibodies were 74.2% one month \nafter the first dose and 100% after the second dose given at month 6 (i.e. month 7). The anti-HBs \nseroprotection rates (titers ≥ 10 mlU/ml) at these time points were 37.4% and 98.2% respectively. \n\nIn a comparative clinical trial conducted among subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 \nyears of age, 142 received two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard three-dose (0, 1, 6 \nmonths) of the combined HAB vaccine. The latter contained 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated \nhepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen. For the 289 subjects \nevaluable for immunogenicity, seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were \nsignificantly higher at months 2 and 6 with the three-dose vaccine than with Ambirix.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• This vaccine has been prescribed for you/your child only. Do not pass it on to others. \n• If you/your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes \n\nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nThis leaflet has been written assuming the person receiving the vaccine is reading it, but it can be \ngiven to adolescents and children so you may be reading it for your child. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Ambirix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Ambirix \n3. How Ambirix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ambirix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Ambirix is and what it is used for \n \n\nAmbirix is a vaccine used in infants, children and young people from 1 year up to and including 15 \nyears. It is used to prevent two diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B.  \n \n• Hepatitis A: Infection with the hepatitis A virus may cause the liver to become swollen \n\n(inflamed).  The virus is usually caught from food or drink that contains the virus. However, it is \nsometimes caught in other ways, such as by swimming in water that has sewage in it or from \nanother infected person. The virus is found in body fluids such as faeces, serum or saliva. \n\n Symptoms begin 3 to 6 weeks after infection. Some people can feel sick, have a fever and aches \nand pains. After a few days they may be very tired, and have dark urine, pale faeces, yellowish \nskin or eyes (jaundice). The severity and type of symptoms can vary. Young children may not get \nall symptoms. Most children recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to make \nchildren ill for about a month. \n\n \n• Hepatitis B: Infection with the hepatitis B virus may cause the liver to become swollen \n\n(inflamed). The virus is usually caught from another infected person. It is found in body fluids \nsuch as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit).  \nSymptoms may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Not always people who have \nbeen infected look or feel ill. Some people can feel sick, have a fever and aches and pains. \nHowever, others can become very ill. They may be very tired, and have dark urine, pale faeces, \nyellowish skin or eyes (jaundice). Some people may need to go into hospital. \n\n \nMost adults fully recover from the disease, but some people (particularly children) who may not \nhave had symptoms can remain infected. They are called hepatitis B “carriers” and can still infect \nother people throughout their lives. Carriers are also at risk of serious liver problems, such as \nscarring (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nHow Ambirix works \n \n• Ambirix helps the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. The  \n\nvaccine does not contain live virus (see section 6 for the content of the vaccine) and therefore \ncannot cause hepatitis A or B infections. \n\n \n• As with all vaccines, some people respond less well to a vaccine than others. \n \n• Ambirix may not protect you from being ill if you have already caught the hepatitis A or B virus. \n \n• Ambirix can only help to protect you against infections with hepatitis A or B viruses. It cannot \n\nprotect against other infections that can affect the liver – even though these infections might have \nsigns similar to those caused by the hepatitis A or B virus. \n\n  \n \n2.  What you need to know before you receive Ambirix \n \nAmbirix should not be given if: \n \n• you are allergic to Ambirix, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). \n\nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of \nyour face or tongue \n\n• you have previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B \ndiseases \n\n• you have a severe infection with a high temperature. The vaccine can be given after you have \nrecovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor \nfirst. \n\n \nAmbirix should not be given if any of the above apply. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist before having Ambirix. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before having Ambirix if: \n \n• you need to be fully protected against hepatitis A and B infection within the next 6  months – \n\nyour doctor may recommend a different vaccine  \n• you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily - the injection may be given just under the skin \n\ninstead of into a muscle to reduce the amount of bleeding or bruising \n• you have immune system problems (such as due to an illness, treatment or dialysis) - the \n\nvaccine may not work fully. This means you may not be protected against one or both of the \nhepatitis A and B viruses. Your doctor will run blood tests to see whether more injections are \nneeded to help you be better protected \n\n• you have fainted before or during a previous injection – in case this happens again. Fainting can \noccur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection.  \n\n \nIf any of the above apply (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before having \nAmbirix. \n \nOther medicines and Ambirix \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines. \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Ask your doctor, nurse \nor pharmasist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf you are taking medicines that affect your body’s immune response, you can still have Ambirix if \nthis is thought to be necessary. However, the vaccine may not work fully. This means that you may \nnot be protected against one or both of the hepatitis A and B viruses. Your doctor will run blood tests \nto see whether more injections are needed to help you be better protected. \n \nAmbirix may need to be given at the same time as other vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, \ndiphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b or \nsome types of treatments for hepatitis infections called “immunoglobulins”. Your doctor will make \nsure that the vaccines are injected into different parts of your body. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before having this vaccine. Ambirix is not usually \ngiven to women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYou may feel sleepy or dizzy after having Ambirix. If this happens, do not drive, cycle or use any \ntools or machines. \n \nAmbirix contains neomycin and sodium \n \nThis vaccine contains neomycin (an antibiotic). Ambirix should not be given if you are allergic to \nneomycin.  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (9 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How Ambirix is given \n \nHow the injection is given \n \n• The doctor or nurse will give Ambirix as an injection into a muscle. This is usually into the \n\nupper arm. \n• They will take care that Ambirix is not given into a vein.  \n• In very small children, the injection may be given into the thigh muscle. \n \nHow much is given  \n \n• You will normally have a total of two injections. Each is given on a separate visit. \n• The injections will be given within 12 months: \n - The first injection – on a date agreed with your doctor.  \n - The second injection – between 6 and 12 months after the first injection. \n \nYour doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses, and future booster dosing. \n \nMissing a dose \n \n• If you miss the second injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit as soon as \n\npossible. \n \n• Make sure you finish the complete course of two injections. If not, you may not be protected \n\nagainst the diseases. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you may \nneed urgent medical treatment: \n \n• allergic and anaphylactic reactions - the signs can include a rash that may be itchy or blistering, \n\nswelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood \npressure and loss of consciousness. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the serious side effects listed above. \n \nSide effects that occurred during clinical trials with Ambirix were as follows: \n \nVery common (These may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) : \n• headache \n• loss of appetite \n• feeling tired or irritable \n• pain and redness where the injection was given \n \nCommon (These may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) : \n• fever \n• feeling drowsy \n• stomach and digestive problems \n• swelling where the injection was given \n \nAdditional side effects that have been reported  during clinical trials with very similar \ncombined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines, include: \n \nCommon (These may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) : \n• generally feeling unwell \n• diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea) \n• reaction where the injection was given \n \nUncommon (These may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine) : \n• feeling dizzy \n• stomach pain \n• being sick (vomiting) \n• upper airway infections \n• aching muscles (myalgia) \n \nRare (These may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine) : \n• low blood pressure \n• joint pain (arthralgia) \n• itching (pruritus), rash \n• pins and needles (paraesthesia) \n• swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy) \n• flu-like symptoms, such as high temperature, sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills \n\n \nVery rare (These may occur with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): \n• hives (urticaria) \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nPlease contact your doctor if you have similar side effects. \n\n \nSide effects that occurred during routine use of Ambirix were as follows: \n\n \n• fainting \n• loss of skin sensitivity to pain or touch (hypoaesthesia) \n \nAdditional side effects that occurred during routine use of very similar combined or individual \nhepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines were as follows: \n \n• multiple sclerosis \n• swelling of the spinal cord (myelitis) \n• abnormal test results relating to the liver \n• swelling or infection of the brain (encephalitis) \n• inflammation of some blood vessels (vasculitis) \n• a degenerative disease of the brain (encephalopathy) \n• swelling of the face, mouth and throat (angioneurotic oedema) \n• severe headache with stiff neck and sensitivity to light (meningitis) \n• a temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness and paralysis in the arms and legs \n\nand often progressing to the chest and face (Guillain-Barré syndrome)   \n• fits or seizures  \n• inflammation of the nerves (neuritis) \n• disease of the nerves of the eyes (optic neuritis) \n• numbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy) \n• immediate injection site pain, stinging and burning feeling \n• paralysis, drooping eyelid and sagging muscles on one side of the face (facial palsy)   \n• disease mainly affecting the joints with pain and swelling (arthritis), muscular weakness \n• purple or reddish-purple bumps on the skin (lichen planus), serious skin rashes (erythema \n\nmultiforme) \n• reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia), \n\npurple or red brown spots visible through the skin (thrombocytopenic purpura) \n   \n\nReporting of side effects  \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.  How to store Ambirix \n \nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date refers to \nthe last day of that month. \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze.
