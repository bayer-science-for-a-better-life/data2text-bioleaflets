NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPaxene 6 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains 6 mg/ml of paclitaxel (30 mg of paclitaxel in 5 ml or 100 mg of paclitaxel in 16.7 ml \nor 150 mg of paclitaxel in 25 ml or 300 mg of paclitaxel in 50 ml). \n \nExcipients \n \nOne vial contains polyoxyl castor oil: 527 mg/ml and ethanol anhydrous; 49.7 v/v% \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear, colourless to slightly yellow, viscous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPaxene is indicated for the treatment of patients with: \n– advanced AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (AIDS-KS) who have failed prior liposomal \n\nanthracycline therapy; \n– metastatic carcinoma of the breast (MBC) who have failed, or are not candidates for standard \n\nanthracycline-containing therapy; \n– advanced carcinoma of the ovary (AOC) or with residual disease (> 1 cm) after initial \n\nlaparotomy, in combination with cisplatin as first-line treatment; \n– metastatic carcinoma of the ovary (MOC) after failure of platinum-containing combination \n\ntherapy without taxanes as second-line treatment; \n– non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery \n\nand/or radiation therapy, in combination with cisplatin. Limited efficacy data supports this \nindication (see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPaxene should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised \nin the administration of cytotoxic agents (see section 6.6). \n \nAll patients must be pre-medicated with corticosteroids, antihistamines and H2 antagonists prior to \nPaxene. The following is a recommended pre-medication regimen: dexamethasone (8 - 20 mg) given \norally (12 and 6 hours) or intravenously (30 - 60 mins) prior to Paxene, chlorpheniramine 10 mg \nintravenously or an equivalent antihistamine 30 to 60 minutes before Paxene and cimetidine (300 mg) \nor ranitidine (50 mg) intravenously 30 to 60 minutes before Paxene. Appropriate supportive medicinal \nproducts should be readily available in case of severe hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nFor use of cisplatin in treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, \nplease consult the cisplatin Summary of Product Characteristics for information.  \n\n 2\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma \nThe recommended dose of Paxene is 100 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion every \ntwo weeks. \n \nMetastatic breast and ovarian cancer (second-line treatment) \nThe recommended dose of Paxene is 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion every \nthree weeks. \n \nAdvanced ovarian carcinoma (first-line treatment) \nAlthough other dose regimens/combinations are under investigation, a combination regimen of Paxene \nand cisplatin is recommended. According to the duration of infusion, two dose regimes of Paxene are \nrecommended: Paxene 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2 every three weeks or Paxene 135 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2 every three weeks. \n \nAdvanced non-small cell lung carcinoma \nThe recommended dose of Paxene is 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion, \nfollowed by cisplatin at a dose of 80 mg/m2 every three weeks. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nMetastatic breast carcinoma, ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma: \nCourses of Paxene should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and the \nplatelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3. Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophils \n< 500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer) or severe peripheral neuropathy during Paxene therapy should \nhave their dose reduced by 20 % (NSCLC and first-line treatment of ovarian cancer) or 25 % (MBC \nand MOC) for subsequent courses of Paxene. Patients who experience mucositis (Grade 2 or worse) \nduring Paxene therapy should have their dose reduced by 25 % for subsequent courses of Paxene. \n \nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma \nCourses of Paxene should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 1,000 cells/mm3 and the \nplatelet count is at least 75,000 cells/mm3. Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophils \n< 500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer), severe peripheral neuropathy or mucositis (Grade 3 or worse) \nduring Paxene therapy should have their dose reduced by 25 % to 75 mg/m2 for subsequent courses of \nPaxene. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with impaired hepatic function: \nAdequate data are not available to recommend dose alterations in patients with mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction should not be \ntreated with paclitaxel. \n \nPatients with impaired renal function: \nStudies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and there are insufficient \ndata to permit dose recommendations (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric use: \nSafety and efficacy in children and adolescents (under 18 years) has not been established. Therefore, \npaclitaxel is not recommended for paediatric use. \n \nPaxene should be administered via an infusion control device (pump) using non-PVC tubing and \nconnectors. An in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than 0.22 µm should be \nattached to the intravenous tubing during infusion of Paxene (see section 6.6). \n \n \n\n 3\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to paclitaxel or to any of the excipients. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment. \n \nBaseline neutrophil count < 1,500 cells/mm3 (< 1,000 cells/mm3 for AIDS-KS). \n \nConcurrent, serious, uncontrolled infections. \n \nPregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nPatients must be routinely premedicated with a corticosteroid, an antihistamine, and an H2-receptor \nantagonist prior to Paxene to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.2). \n \nPaxene should be given before cisplatin when used in combination (see section 4.5). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nMinor symptoms such as flushing or skin reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, \nsevere reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnoea requiring bronchodilators, \nangio-oedema or generalised urticaria require immediate discontinuation of paclitaxel and aggressive \nsymptomatic therapy. Patients experiencing severe reactions should not be rechallenged with the \nproduct. \n \nPatients should be observed closely during the initial cycles of treatment. Appropriate supportive \ntherapies should be readily available in case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction.  \n \nHaematology \n \nPaclitaxel causes bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia). Therefore, frequent complete \nblood counts should be performed on all patients during treatment. Patients with baseline neutrophil \ncounts < 1,500 cells/mm3 (< 1,000 cells/mm3 for AIDS-KS) should not receive paclitaxel. \n \nPatients should not be re-treated with subsequent cycles of paclitaxel until neutrophil counts recover to \n≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (≥ 1,000 cells/mm3 for AIDS-KS patients) and platelets recover to a level of \n≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 (≥ 75,000 cells/mm3 for AIDS-KS patients).  \n \nPatients with severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for 7 days or more) during a course of paclitaxel or \nneutropenic sepsis should have their dose of paclitaxel reduced for subsequent courses of Paxene \ntherapy (see section 4.2).  \n \nMucositis \n \nModerate to severe mucositis is uncommon with the recommended dose and schedule of Paxene. \nHowever, if treatment is to be continued in the event of moderate or severe reactions, the dose of \npaclitaxel should be reduced for subsequent courses of Paxene (see section 4.2). \n \nNeuropathy \n \nNeuropathy, primarily peripheral sensory neuropathy, occurs very commonly and is usually of mild to \nmoderate intensity. Severe peripheral neuropathy occurred in 3 % of patients treated with the \nrecommended dose and schedule of Paxene. In the treatment of NSCLC and the first-line treatment of \novarian cancer, the administration of paclitaxel as a 3 hour infusion in combination with cisplatin \n\n 4\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nresulted in a greater incidence of severe neurotoxicity than both single-agent paclitaxel and \ncyclophosphamide followed by cisplatin.  \n \nIf severe peripheral neuropathy occurs the benefit of continued treatment should be weighed against \nthe risks. However, if treatment is to be continued, the dose of paclitaxel should be reduced for all \nsubsequent courses of Paxene (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias \n \nIn patients treated with paclitaxel severe conduction abnormalities are rare. Mild electrocardiogram \nchanges have been observed during administration of paclitaxel. Cardiac monitoring is not \nrecommended except in patients with serious conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias. In the rare \nevent of serious conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias, appropriate therapy and continuous cardiac \nmonitoring is recommended during subsequent cycles of therapy. Hypotension, hypertension and \nbradycardia have been observed during administration of paclitaxel but patients are usually \nasymptomatic and do not require therapy.  \n \nAdditionally, in Paxene MBC and MOC studies tachycardia, palpitation and syncope were observed. \nTherefore, frequent monitoring of vital signs during the first hours of Paxene infusion is \nrecommended.  \n \nIn the MBC and MOC studies a total of two patients experienced Grade 4 congestive heart failure. A \nsingle case of heart failure related to Paxene was seen in the AIDS-KS clinical study. \n \nSevere cardiovascular events were observed more frequently in patients with NSCLC than breast or \novarian carcinoma. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly Grade 3-4 \nmyelosuppression. There is no evidence that the toxicity of paclitaxel is increased when given as a \n3 hour infusion to patients with mildly abnormal liver function. When given as a longer infusion, \nincreased myelosuppression may be seen in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of profound myelosuppression (see \nsection 4.2). Adequate data are not available to recommend dose alterations in patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairments (see section 4.2).  No data are available for patients with severe \nbaseline cholestasis.  Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel. \n \nGastrointestinal \n \nPseudomembranous colitis has been rarely reported including cases in patients who have not been \nconcomitantly treated with antibiotics. This reaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis \nof cases of severe or persistent diarrhoea occurring during or shortly after treatment with paclitaxel. \n \nOthers \n \nAs Paxene contains ethanol (392 mg/ml), possible effects on the CNS and other effects should be \nconsidered (see section 4.7). \n \nPaclitaxel, particularly in combination with radiation of the lung and/or gemcitabine, irrespective of \ntheir chronological order, may contribute to the development of interstitial pneumonitis. \n \nLike other genotoxic cytostatics, paclitaxel can have genotoxic effects. Male patients treated with \nPaxene are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment. \n \nPaxene contains polyoxyl castor oil, which can cause an allergic reaction. \n \n\n 5\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nSince Paxene contains ethanol, consideration should be given to possible central nervous system and \nother effects. The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFormal clinical drug interaction studies have not been performed with Paxene. \n \nWhen administered as part of a combination regimen with cisplatin, it is recommended that Paxene is \ngiven before cisplatin. When paclitaxel is given before cisplatin, the safety profile of paclitaxel is \nconsistent with that reported for single-agent use. When paclitaxel was given after cisplatin, patients \nshowed a more profound myelosuppression and an approximately 20 % decrease in paclitaxel \nclearance. \n \nSince elimination of doxorubicin and its active metabolites may be reduced when paclitaxel and \ndoxorubicin are used in combination, paclitaxel should be administered 24 hours after doxorubicin. \n \nSince paclitaxel is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP 3A4 and 2C8, caution should be \nexercised with other medicinal products known to inhibit (e.g. erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, \nimidazole antifungals) or induce (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, efavirenz, \nnevirapine) these enzymes as they may affect the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Concurrent \nadministration of ketoconazole, a known potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, does not inhibit the elimination \nof paclitaxel in patients; thus, both medicinal products may be administered together without dosage \nadjustment. Further data on the potential of drug interactions between paclitaxel and other CYP 3A4 \nsubstrates/inhibitors are limited. \n \nStudies conducted in AIDS-KS patients who were taking Paxene and multiple concomitant medicinal \nproducts suggest that the systemic clearance of paclitaxel was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the \npresence of nelfinavir and ritonavir, but not with indinavir. Insufficient information is available on \ninteractions with other protease inhibitors. Consequently, Paxene should be administered with caution \nin patients receiving protease inhibitors as concomitant therapy.  \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nPaxene should not be used in pregnancy. Women should be advised to use effective means of \ncontraception to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Paxene and to inform the treating \nphysician immediately should this occur. \n \nPaxene is contraindicated during lactation. It is unknown whether paclitaxel is excreted in human \nmilk. Therefore, breast-feeding should be discontinued for the duration of Paxene therapy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFollowing an infusion of Paxene, the patients’ performance at skilled tasks such as driving and \noperating machines may be impaired due to the alcohol content of Paxene (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nMonotherapy \n \nThe following adverse reactions relate to 166 MBC and 120 MOC patients treated with 175 mg/m2 \nPaxene administered as a 3-hour infusion as second-line chemotherapy in two clinical studies and \nwere considered possibly or probably related to Paxene. As the AIDS-KS population is very specific, \nsafety data from a clinical study of 107 AIDS-KS patients are presented separately at the end of this \nsection. \n \n\n 6\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nBone marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of Paxene. Severe neutropenia \n(< 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 26 % of patients treated with Paxene during the entire treatment period. \n19 % of patients had severe neutropenia for > 7 days. Thrombocytopenia was observed in 6 % of \npatients. Two percent of patients had a platelet count nadir < 50,000 cells/mm3. Anaemia \n(Hb< 11 g/dl) was observed in approximately 9 % of treated patients but was severe in less than 1 % \n(Hb< 8 g/dl).  \n \nNeuropathy occurred in 18 % of patients treated with Paxene. Paraesthesia was observed in 48 % of \npatients. Severe neuropathy and severe paraesthesia occurred in 3 % and 5 % of patients, respectively. \nPeripheral neuropathy can occur following the first course and can worsen with increasing exposure to \npaclitaxel. Peripheral neuropathy was the cause of paclitaxel discontinuation in a few cases. Sensory \nsymptoms have usually improved or resolved within months of paclitaxel discontinuation. Pre-existing \nneuropathies resulting from prior therapies are not a contraindication for paclitaxel therapy.  \n \nThe other most commonly reported nervous system disorder is somnolence, which affected 14 % of \npatients. \n \nArthralgia was reported in 32 % of all patients (5 % severe) and myalgia in 47 % (6 % severe).  \n \nInjection site reactions including reactions secondary to extravasation were usually mild and consisted \nof erythema, tenderness, skin discolouration, or swelling at the injection site but can result in cellulitis. \nRecurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel \nat a different site i.e. “recall” has been reported rarely. There is no known specific treatment for \nextravasation reactions. \n \nThe table below lists undesirable effects associated with the administration of single agent paclitaxel \nas a 3 hour infusion in the metastatic setting (286 patients treated in Paxene clinical studies and \n812 patients treated in other paclitaxel clinical studies), and those reported in the postmarketing \nsurveillance of paclitaxel*.

chemotherapy of ovarian cancer \n(paclitaxel plus cisplatin: over 1,050 patients) and two Phase III trials for the treatment of advanced \nNSCLC (paclitaxel plus cisplatin: over 360 patients) (see section 5.1). \n \nWhen administered as a 3 hour infusion for the first-line chemotherapy of ovarian cancer, \nneurotoxicity, arthralgia/myalgia, and hypersensitivity were reported as more frequent and severe by \npatients treated with paclitaxel followed by cisplatin than patients treated with ciclophosphamide \nfollowed by cisplatin. Myelosuppression appeared to be less frequent and severe with paclitaxel as a \n3 hour infusion followed by cisplatin compared with ciclophosphamide followed by cisplatin. \n \nNeurotoxicity, mainly peripheral neuropathy, appeared to be more frequent and severe with a \n175 mg/m2 3 hour infusion (85 % neurotoxicity, 15 % severe) than with a 135 mg/m2 24 hour infusion \n(25 % peripheral neuropathy, 3 % severe) when paclitaxel was combined with cisplatin. In NSCLC \nand ovarian cancer patients treated with paclitaxel over 3 hours followed by cisplatin, there is an \napparent increase in the incidence of severe neurotoxicity. Peripheral neuropathy can occur following \nthe first course and can worsen with increasing exposure to paclitaxel. Peripheral neuropathy was the \ncause of paclitaxel discontinuation in a few cases. Sensory symptoms have usually improved or \nresolved within months of paclitaxel discontinuation. Pre-existing neuropathies resulting from prior \ntherapies are not a contraindication for paclitaxel therapy. \n \nIn eight published clinical trials (8 Phase III trials) including 4,735 patients with advanced ovarian \ncancer and in twelve published clinical trials (one large Phase II and eleven Phase III trials) including \n4,315 NSCLC patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum-containing regimens, similar undesirable \neffects were observed compared to single-agent paclitaxel treatment. Additionally ileus, effects on \ncreatinine clearance, abnormal electrolytes (e.g. hyponatraemia, hypomagnesaemia), hyperglycaemia, \ncough and pneumonia occurred very rarely. \n \nPneumonitis in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy and/or gemcitabine has been reported very \nrarely. \n \nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma \n \nThe following undesirable effects relate to 107 AIDS-KS patients treated with 100 mg/m2 Paxene \nadministered as a 3 hour infusion as second-line chemotherapy in a clinical study, and were considered \npossibly or probably related to Paxene. Except for haematological and hepatic events (see below), \ngenerally the frequency and severity of undesirable effects in AIDS-KS patients were similar to those \nnoted in patients with other solid tumours treated with paclitaxel monotherapy. \n \nBone marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of Paxene. Severe neutropenia \n(< 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 20 % and 39% of patients during the first course of treatment and the \nentire treatment period, respectively. Neutropenia was present for > 7 days in 41 % and for \n30 - 35 days in 8 % of patients. Neutropenia resolved in 35 days in all patients who were followed. \nThe incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 days or more was 22 %. Neutropenic fever related to \nPaxene was reported in 14 % of patients. There were three septic episodes (2.8 %) during Paxene \nadministration related to the medicinal product that proved fatal. Thrombocytopenia was observed in \n50% of patients, and was severe (< 50,000 cells/mm3) in 9 %. Bleeding episodes related to Paxene \nwere reported in < 3% of patients and bleeding was localised. Anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) was observed \nin 61 % of patients and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dL) in 10 %. Red cell transfusions were required in 21 % \nof patients. \n\n \nAmong patients (> 50 % on protease inhibitors) with normal baseline liver function, 28 %, 43 % and \n44 % had elevations in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and AST (SGOT), respectively. For each of \nthese parameters, the increases were severe in 1% of cases. \n   \n\n 10\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo known antidote exists for Paxene overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be \nclosely monitored. Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, which are bone \nmarrow suppression, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: taxanes, ATC code: L01CD01. \n \nThe active substance of Paxene is paclitaxel. The exact mechanism of the antitumour activity of \npaclitaxel is not known. It is generally believed that paclitaxel promotes the assembly of microtubules \nfrom tubulin dimer and prevents depolymerisation. Stabilisation results in the inhibition of the normal \ndynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic \ncellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle \nand multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Paxene (175 mg/m² over 3 hours at 3-week intervals) in refractory \nmetastatic breast cancer were investigated in 172 women in a multicentre, open-label Phase III trial. \nThe clinical response rate was 18.5 %, median time to progression was 2.8 months \n(CI: 2.1 - 3.3 months) and the median survival time was 9.9 months (CI: 7.8 - 13.1 months). The \nresults obtained with Paxene are closely similar to those of published paclitaxel Phase III trials. \n \nAdvanced ovarian cancer (first-line treatment) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of paclitaxel were evaluated in two  major, randomised, controlled trials (vs. \nciclophosphamide 750 mg/m2/ cisplatin 75 mg/m2). In the first trial, over 650 patients with stage IIb-c, \nIII or IV primary ovarian cancer received a maximum of 9 treatment courses of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 \nover 3 hours) followed by cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or control. The second major trial evaluated a \nmaximum of 6 courses of either paclitaxel (135 mg/m² over 24 hours) followed by cisplatin \n(75 mg/m²) or control in over 400 patients with stage III/IV primary ovarian cancer, with a > 1 cm \nresidual disease after staging laparotomy, or with distant metastases. Although the two different \npaclitaxel posologies were not compared with each other directly, in both trials patients treated with \npaclitaxel in combination with cisplatin had a significantly longer time to progression (Study 1: \nmedian 15.3 months vs 11.5 months, p< 0.001; Study 2: median 17 months vs 13 months, p< 0.001), \nand longer survival time (Study 1: median 36 months vs 26 months, p= 0.0016; Study 2: median \n36 months vs 24 months, p< 0.001), and in Study 1 a significantly higher response rate (Study 1: 59 % \nvs 45 %, p= 0.014; Study 2: 60 % vs 50 %, NS), when compared with standard therapy. Increased \nneurotoxicity, arthralgia/myalgia but reduced myelosuppression were observed in advanced ovarian \ncancer patients administered 3 hour infusion paclitaxel/cisplatin as compared with patients who \nreceived ciclophosphamide/cisplatin. \n \nMetastatic ovarian cancer (second-line treatment) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Paxene (175 mg/m² over 3 hours repeated at 3-week intervals) in advanced \nmetastatic ovarian cancer were investigated in 120 women in a multicentre, open-label extended \nPhase II trial. The clinical response rate was 21.7 % (CI: 14.7 - 31.1 %), median time to progression \nwas 4.1 months (CI: 3.3 - 4.9 months) and the median survival time was 13.4 months \n(CI: 11.5 - 15.0 months). The results obtained with Paxene are closely similar to those of published \npaclitaxel Phase III trials. \n \n\n 11\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nAdvanced non-small cell lung carcinoma \n \nEfficacy of paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been demonstrated in two randomised, \ncontrolled trials in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.  \n \nIn the first study, 332 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomised to receive \ncisplatin (80 mg/m2) in combination with teniposide (100 mg/m2; n= 166), or cisplatin (80 mg/m2) and \npaclitaxel (175 mg/m2; n= 166). There was no advantage in survival (9.5 vs. 9.9 months) or \nprogression free survival (5.1 vs. 5.0 months) with cisplatin/paclitaxel vs cisplatin/tenoposide. \nHowever, the higher response rates (37 % vs. 26 %), lesser overall side effects and improved short \nterm QoL with cisplatin/paclitaxel vs cisplatin/tenoposide were considered important results in a \npalliative population. Grade 2 or 3 peripheral neurotoxicity was observed more commonly with \ncisplatin/paclitaxel (29 % vs. 6 %). \n \nIn the second study, 599 patients with stage IIIB or IV disease were randomised to receive cisplatin \n(75 mg/m2) and etoposide (100 mg/m2; n= 200), or cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and low-dose paclitaxel \n(135 mg/m2; n= 198), or cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and high-dose paclitaxel (250 mg/m2) with G-CSF \n(n= 201). Median survival for each paclitaxel-containing arm was not significantly different compared \nto etoposide/cisplatin (p= 0.097 and 0.090 for high-dose paclitaxel and low-dose paclitaxel, \nrespectively). With respect to progression free survival, highly statistically significant results were \nnoted for the high-dose paclitaxel arm compared with etoposide/cisplatin (p= 0.007). Response rates \nstrongly favoured the paclitaxel-containing arms [13 %, 30 % and 26 % for the etoposide/cisplatin, \nhigh-dose paclitaxel (p< 0.001 vs etoposide/cisplatin) and low-dose paclitaxel regimens \n(p= 0.003 vs etoposide/cisplatin), respectively]. A greater proportion of paclitaxel-treated patients had \nimprovements in short-term QoL. \nHowever, Grade 3 neurotoxicity was significantly more common in the high-dose paclitaxel arm vs. \netoposide/cisplatin (40  % vs. 21 %).  \n \nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Paxene were investigated in a single, non-comparative study in 107 patients \nwith advanced KS, previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. In the study, the majority of \npatients were administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The primary endpoint was \nbest tumour response. Patients were given a 3 hour infusion of Paxene 100 mg/m² administered every \n14 days. Of the 107 patients, 63 patients were considered resistant to liposomal anthracyclines. This \nsubgroup of patients is considered to constitute the core efficacy population. \n \nThe overall success rate (complete or partial response) after 15 cycles of treatment was 57 % \n(CI: 44 - 70 %) in liposomal anthracycline-resistant patients. More than half of the responses were \napparent after the first three cycles of treatment. In liposomal anthracycline-resistant patients, the \nresponse rates were comparable for patients who had never received a protease inhibitor (55.6 %) and \nthose who received one at least 2 months prior to treatment with Paxene (60.9 %). \n \nThe median time to progression in the core population was 468 days (95 % CI 257-NE). Median \nsurvival for Paxene could not be computed, but the lower 95 % bound was 617 days in core patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, plasma concentrations decline in a biphasic or triphasic manner. \nThe disposition of paclitaxel is non-linear (concentration dependent) as the systemic exposure \nincreases more than expected following an increase in dosage. \n \nBased on in vitro studies, the degree of plasma protein binding has been reported to range from \n88 to 98 %. In spite of this high protein binding, paclitaxel is widely distributed to tissues. \n \n\n 12\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 given over 3 hours in 13 patients with breast \ncancer were as follows: maximum concentration (Cmax) was 3,890 ng/ml, area under the plasma \nconcentration vs. time curve (AUClast) was 14,090 ng/h/ml and clearance (CL) was 13.3 l/h/m2. \n \nMetastatic breast or ovarian cancer \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 given over 3 hours in 5 patients with breast \ncancer and 3 patients with ovarian cancer were as follows: maximum concentration (Cmax) was \n4,213 ng/ml, area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUClast) was 12,603 ng·h/ml and \nclearance (CL) was 20.4 l/h/m2. \n \nRenal excretion plays a minor role in the elimination of paclitaxel, less than 10 % of the dose has been \nreported to be excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. The major elimination pathway is metabolism \nfollowed by biliary excretion; in six patients 39 % to 87 % of an intravenous dose (175 mg/m2) was \nexcreted in faeces and, on average, only 10 % of the dose was excreted as unchanged paclitaxel. \nSeveral metabolites have been detected, but only three of them have been identified: \n6 alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel, 3’-para-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 alpha, 3’-para-dihydroxypaclitaxel. \n6 alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel is the major component excreted in faeces. In vitro studies have shown that \nCYP 2C8 and 3A4 are involved in the formation of 6 alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel and \n3’-para-dihydroxypaclitaxel, respectively. \n \nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma \n \nFollowing an intravenous dose of 100 mg/m2 given as a 3 hour infusion to 19 patients with \nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, the maximum concentrations ranged from 761 to 2,860 ng/ml \n(mean 1,530) and average area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) was \n5,619 ng/h/ml (range 2,609 - 9,428). Clearance was 20.6 l/h/m2 (range 11 - 38) and the volume of \ndistribution was 291 l/m2 (range 121 - 638). The terminal elimination half-life averaged 23.7 hours \n(range 12 - 33). \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility \nPaclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice), but it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster \novary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/HGPRT) gene mutation assay. The \ncarcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied. However, paclitaxel belongs to a class of \nsubstances which are potentially carcinogenic based on their mechanism of action. Paclitaxel at low \ndoses of 0.6 mg/kg/day was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats. Animal studies \nshowed non-reversible, toxic effects on the male reproductive organs at clinically relevant exposure \nlevels. \n \n \n6.

In order to minimise patient exposure to the plasticiser \nDEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted \nPaxene solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, \npolyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial: 2 years. \n \nChemical, physical and microbial stability of unused, undiluted product remaining in the vial has been \ndemonstrated for up to 28 days when stored below 25 °C. Other in-use storage times and conditions \nare the responsibility of the user. \n \nFollowing dilution, chemical and physical in-use stability in polypropylene infusion bags has been \ndemonstrated for 24 hours when stored below 25 ºC. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the diluted product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n5 ml clear glass (type I) vial fitted with a flip-off cap, containing 30 mg of concentrate. \n \n20 ml clear glass (type I) vial fitted with a flip-off cap, containing 100 mg of concentrate. \n \n30 ml clear glass (type I) vial fitted with a flip-off cap, containing 150 mg of concentrate. \n \n50 ml clear glass (type I) vial fitted with a flip-off cap, containing 300 mg of concentrate. \n \nFour pack sizes are available: 30 mg/5 ml vial, 100 mg/16.7 ml vial, 150 mg/25 ml vial and 300 mg/50 \nml vial packaged in a carton.  \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Instructions for use, handling and disposal \n \nFor single use only. Dispose of any remaining contents after first use. \n \nPreparation and administration precautions \nPaclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution \nshould be exercised in handling Paxene. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is \nrecommended. If Paxene solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with \n\n 14\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nsoap and water. If Paxene contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly \nwith water. Paxene should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the \nhandling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Paxene. \n \nPreparation for intravenous infusion \nPaxene concentrate for solution for infusion must be diluted prior to infusion. Paxene should be \ndiluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion, glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for \ninjection, or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) in Ringer’s solution for injection to a final concentration of \n0.3 to 1.2 mg/ml. Following dilution, chemical and physical in-use stability in polypropylene infusion \nbags has been demonstrated for at least 24 hours below 25 °C. From a microbiological point of view, \nthe diluted product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \nconditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than \n24 hours at 2 to 8° C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \nprior to administration. Upon preparation, solutions may show haziness, which is attributed to the \nformulation vehicle. \n \nPaxene solutions should be prepared and stored in glass, polypropylene, or polyolefin containers. Non-\nPVC containing administration sets, such as those which are polyethylene-lined, should be used. \n \nPaxene should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than \n0.22 µm. Use of filter devices such as those which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated \ntubing has not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP. \n \nHandling and disposa \nProcedures for proper handling and disposal of cytotoxic medicinal products should be followed. \n \n \n7.

It \n\nmay harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n \n1.

WHAT PAXENE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nPaxene belongs to a group of medicines known as antineoplastic agents. These agents are used to treat \ncancer. \n \nPaxene concentrate for solution for infusion is used to treat: \n• Advanced AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma when certain other treatments (liposomal \n\nanthracyclines) have been tried but have not worked. This is a tumour that arises from blood \nvessels in the skin or internal organs and typically appears as flat or raised, purple to dark brown \npatches on the skin. \n\n• Advanced breast cancer when certain other treatments (standard anthracycline-containing \ntherapy) have been tried but have not worked or when the patient is unsuitable for these \ntreatments. \n\n• Advanced ovarian cancer or remaining tumour (> 1 cm) after initial surgery, in combination \nwith cisplatin as first-line treatment.  \n\n• Advanced ovarian cancer when certain other treatments (platinum-containing combination \ntherapy without taxanes) have been tried but have not worked (as second-line treatment). \n\n• Advanced non-small cell lung cancer if potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy are \nnot possible, in combination with cisplatin. There is limited information to support treatment of \nthis condition. \n\n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE PAXENE \n \nDo not use Paxene \n \n• if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients of Paxene, \n• if you have ever had any problems with your liver, \n• if you have been told that your white blood cell count is very low, \n• if you have a serious, uncontrolled infection, \n• if you are pregnant, may become pregnant or are breast-feeding. \n \n\n 33\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nTake special care with Paxene \n \n• Before you start treatment with Paxene and during treatment, you will have regular blood tests \n\nto check that it is safe for you to continue with your treatment. \n• Paxene is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n• Tell your doctor immediately if you develop severe or prolonged or bloody diarrhoea during or \n\nafter treatment with Paxene. This may be a sign of a serious bowel inflammation \n(pseudomembranous colitis). \n\n• If you experience an irregular heart beat, dizziness or faintness during treatment. \n• If you previously had radiation treatment (radiotherapy) to your chest (see section 4: Possible \n\nside effects). \n• If you are taking other medicines which could interact with paclitaxel (see Using other \n\nmedicines). \n \n \nUsing other medicines \n \nPlease tell your doctor before you are given Paxene if you: \n• are taking ritonavir, nelfinavir, efavirenz, nevirapine (for the treatment of AIDS) or any other \n\nprescribed medicines for your condition; \n• are taking any other medicines prescribed by a physician for any condition (e.g. erythromycin, \n\nfluoxetine, gemfibrozil, imidazole antifungals, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital); \n\n• are taking other medicines that you have bought for yourself without a prescription. \n \nIf you are already being treated with doxorubicin for your condition, then your first dose of paclitaxel \nshould be given 24 hours after doxorubicin. \n \nPaxene may alter the effect of other medicines because of its high alcohol content. If you see another \ndoctor or visit a hospital, remember to tell them what medicines you are taking. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are breast-feeding before you \nreceive treatment with Paxene. Paxene cannot be used in pregnancy, and women receiving Paxene \nmust not breast-feed. Adequate contraceptive precautions should be used when receiving Paxene. \n \nMale patients treated with Paxene are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after \nthe treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPaxene contains alcohol. Thus it may not be safe for you to drive or to use machines for up to several \nhours after you have had your treatment. Check with your doctor. You should be able to drive and use \nmachines between your treatments with Paxene, unless you feel tired or dizzy \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Paxene \n \nThis medicine contains approximately 50 % by volume of alcohol. Each infusion contains up to 21 g \nof alcohol. The amount of alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines and should \nbe taken into account in patients with liver disease or epilepsy. Following an infusion of Paxene, the \namount of alcohol may impair your ability to drive or use machines.  \n \nPaxene contains polyoxyl castor oil, which can cause an allergic reaction. \n \n\n 34\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3. HOW TO USE PAXENE \n \nYour concentrate for solution for infusion will be diluted and given slowly into a vein over about \n3 hours unless otherwise stated. The amounts (dose) of Paxene you will be given will be worked out \ndepending on your body surface area in square meters (m2) and will also take into account the results \nof your blood tests and your medical condition. If necessary, your doctor will adjust the dosage during \nthe treatment. \n \nAIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma \n \nThe usual dose of Paxene is 100 mg/m2 of body surface area. You will be given Paxene every \ntwo weeks, as long as the results of your blood tests show that it is safe to carry on with your \ntreatment. \n \nAdvanced breast cancer and ovarian cancer (second-line therapy) \n \nThe usual dose of Paxene is 175 mg/m2 of body surface area. You will be given Paxene every \nthree weeks, as long as the results of your blood tests show that it is safe to carry on with your \ntreatment. \n \nAdvanced ovarian cancer (first-line therapy) \n \nTwo doses of Paxene may be given: Paxene 175 mg/m2 of body surface area administrated as a 3 hour \ninfusion into a vein, followed by another medicine, cisplatin, every three weeks; alternatively Paxene \n135 mg/m2 given as a 24 hour infusion, followed by cisplatin, every three weeks. Your continued \ntreatment will depend on the results of your blood tests showing that it is safe to carry on with your \ntreatment. \n \nAdvanced non-small cell lung cancer \n \nThe usual dose of Paxene is 175 mg/m2 of body surface area, followed by cisplatin every three weeks. \nYou will be given this therapy as long as the results of your blood tests show that it is safe to carry on \nwith your treatment. \n \nTo help prevent allergic reactions occurring while you are receiving your infusion you will be given \nmedication before your treatment starts. Twelve and then six hours before your infusion you will be \ngiven dexamethasone (a steroid), either as a tablet to swallow or as an injection. Half to one hour \nbefore your infusion you will be given two different types of injection (an antihistamine and an \nH2 antagonist). \n \nYou will only be given your infusion under medical supervision, and you will be checked regularly \nwhile you are having your infusion to see how you are reacting to it. If you have a history of heart \nproblems, your heart rate may be monitored. If any problems occur while you are having your \ninfusion, the medical staff will be on hand to take any necessary action. \n \n4.

The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is recommended. If \nPaxene solution comes into contact with the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap \nand water. If Paxene contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with \nwater. Paxene should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the \nhandling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Paxene. \n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \n \nPaxene must be diluted under aseptic conditions prior to infusion. Paxene should be diluted in sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion, or \nglucose 50 mg/ml (5%) in Ringer’s solution for injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/ml. \n \nFollowing dilution, chemical and physical in-use stability in polypropylene infusion bags has been \ndemonstrated for at least 24 hours when stored below 25 °C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the diluted product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. \n \nChemical and physical and microbial stability of unused, undiluted product remaining in the vial has \nbeen demonstrated for up to 28 days when stored below 25 ºC. Other in-use storage times and \nconditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \nprior to administration. Upon preparation, solutions may show haziness, which is attributed to the \nformulation vehicle. \n \nLevels of the extractable plasticiser DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate] increase with time and \nconcentration when dilutions are prepared in PVC containers. Consequently, the use of plasticised \nPVC containers and administration sets is not recommended. \n \nPaxene solutions should be prepared and stored in glass, polypropylene, or polyolefin containers. Non-\nPVC containing administration sets, such as those which are polyethylene-lined, should be used. \n \nPaxene should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than \n0.22 µm. Use of filter devices which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated tubing has not \nresulted in significant leaching of DEHP. \n \nHandling and disposal \n \nProcedures for proper handling and disposal of cytotoxic medicinal products should be followed. \n \n \n \n\n 41\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tANNEX II\n\tA.
