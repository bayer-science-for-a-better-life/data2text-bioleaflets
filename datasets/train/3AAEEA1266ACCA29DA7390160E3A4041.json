CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years \nand older. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nand for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic \nepisodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in \nBipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day with a \nmaintenance dose of 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. \nABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher \nthan a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a \nhigher dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg \nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination \ntherapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \nshould not exceed 30 mg. \n \nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/mL) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at \ndoses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may \nbenefit from a higher dose. \nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/mL) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nTics associated with Tourette\u2019s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nSpecial population \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nGender \nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \n \nSmoking status \nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nABILIFY is for oral use. \n \nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nSuicidality \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nOther extrapyramidal symptoms \n \nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \nmonitoring should be considered. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \n \nSeizure \n \nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nIncreased mortality \nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56 to 99 years) of aripiprazole \nin elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with \n\n\n\n 6 \n\naripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-\ntreated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths \nwere varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) \nor infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \n \nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nWeight gain \n \nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n \nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose \n \nABILIFY tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nPatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity \n \nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \n \nFalls \n \nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to its \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \n \nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \n \nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \nfor smokers. \n \nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \nAUC by 107 %, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \n \nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \naripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \n \nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax \nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and \nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \n \nValproate and lithium \nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \n \nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n \nIn clinical studies, 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \n \nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \nmedicinal products, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective serotonin noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI), or with medicinal products that are known to increase aripiprazole \nconcentrations (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAripiprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \ntabulated below. The table is based on adverse events reported during clinical trials and/or post-\nmarketing use. \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \nare derived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is qualified \nas \"not known\". \n \n Common Uncommon Not known \nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Leukopenia \nNeutropenia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Allergic reaction (e.g. \nanaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema including swollen \ntongue, tongue oedema, face \noedema, pruritus allergic, or \nurticaria) \n\nEndocrine  Hyperprolactinaemia Diabetic hyperosmolar coma \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n Common Uncommon Not known \ndisorders Diabetic ketoacidosis \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nDiabetes mellitus Hyperglycaemia Hyponatremia \nAnorexia \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia \nAnxiety \nRestlessness \n\nDepression \nHypersexuality \n\nSuicide attempt, suicidal ideation \nand completed suicide (see \nsection 4.4) \nPathological gambling \nImpulse-control disorder \nBinge eating \nCompulsive shopping \nPoriomania \nAggression \nAgitation \nNervousness  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nAkathisia \nExtrapyramidal \ndisorder \nTremor \nHeadache \nSedation \nSomnolence \nDizziness \n\nTardive dyskinesia \nDystonia \nRestless legs \nsyndrome \n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome \nGrand mal convulsion \nSerotonin syndrome \nSpeech disorder \n\nEye disorders Vision blurred Diplopia \nPhotophobia \n\nOculogyric crisis \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \n \n\nSudden death unexplained \nTorsades de pointes \nVentricular arrhythmia \nCardiac arrest \nBradycardia \n\nVascular disorders  Orthostatic \nhypotension \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n(including pulmonary embolism \nand deep vein thrombosis) \nHypertension \nSyncope \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Hiccups Aspiration pneumonia \nLaryngospasm \nOropharyngeal spasm \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation \nDyspepsia \nNausea \nSalivary \nhypersecretion \nVomiting \n\n  Pancreatitis \nDysphagia \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal discomfort \nStomach discomfort \n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Hepatic failure \nHepatitis \nJaundice \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Rash \nPhotosensitivity reaction \nAlopecia \nHyperhidrosis \nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia \nand Systemic Symptoms \n(DRESS) \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \n\n  Rhabdomyolysis \nMyalgia \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n Common Uncommon Not known \ntissue disorders Stiffness \nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary incontinence \nUrinary retention \n\nPregnancy, \npuerperium and \nperinatal conditions \n\n  Drug withdrawal syndrome \nneonatal (see section 4.6) \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n  Priapism \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n \n\n Temperature regulation disorder \n(e.g. hypothermia, pyrexia) \nChest pain \nPeripheral oedema \n\nInvestigations   Weight decreased \nWeight gain \nAlanine Aminotransferase \nincreased \nAspartate Aminotransferase \nincreased \nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \nAlkaline phosphatase increased \nQT prolonged \nBlood glucose increased \nGlycosylated haemoglobin \nincreased \nBlood glucose fluctuation \nCreatine phosphokinase increased \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAdults \n \nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \nSchizophrenia: in a long-term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-\nlower incidence (25.8 %) of EPS including Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared \nwith those treated with haloperidol (57.3 %). In a long-term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \nwith lithium. In the long-term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \n \nAkathisia \nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \n \nDystonia \nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \nage groups. \n \nProlactin \nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \npatients who received placebo. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13 to 17 years) with \nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (\u2265 1/10), and dry \nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10). \nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was also similar except for the \nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10). \n \nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13 to 17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 29.5 % \nand 48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \nexposure of 5 mg to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females \n(< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \nIn two long-term trials with adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) \nwas 37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (\u2265 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \ntwitching, and dyskinesia. \n \nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %; 30 mg, 28.8 %; placebo, 1.7 %); and akathisia (incidences were \n10 mg, 12.1 %; 30 mg, 20.3 %; placebo, 1.7 %). \n \nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \n \nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with \nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n \nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10 to 17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \nrespectively. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by \nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \noverdose. \n \nHaemodialysis \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole\u2019s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 14 \n\nantagonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin \n5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \naripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for \n2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor \nligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia \nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \n \nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale \n(MADRS) showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \nplacebo. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \n314 adult patients and where the primary endpoint was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \n33 % of evaluable patients). \n \nLipid parameters \nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \nHigh Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). \n \nProlactin \nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \n \nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \n \nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \n \nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \ndepression. \n \nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] and MADRS with \ntotal scores \u2264 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for \n12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % \ndecreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk \n(hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to \ndemonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome measure in Clinical Global \nImpression - Bipolar version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (SOI; mania) scores. In this trial, patients \nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents \nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), \npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \n \nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \n(n = 146; ages 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \n\n\n\n 16 \n\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95 % confidence interval, 0.242 to \n0.879) in the full population. In sub-group analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for \nsubjects 13 to 14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the \nestimation of the HR for the younger (13 to 14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller \nnumber of subjects in that group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for \nthis estimation (ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of \na treatment effect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup \n(aripiprazole, n = 69; placebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be \nconcluded in the older patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \n(10 to 17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) \nfor Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features and had a \nYMRS score \u2265 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in the primary efficacy analysis, \n139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \n \nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \n \nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \ntreated with placebo. \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \nflexible-dose (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, or 15 mg/day)] and \nin one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day \nafter one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of \npatients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy \ncompared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical \nrelevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes \nin prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled \ntrials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) in \naripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-\ncontrolled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13 to \n26-week stabilisation on aripiprazole (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were \neither maintained on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse \nrates at week 16 were 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within \n16 weeks (aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight \ngain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean \nincrease of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase \n(16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase \nin 17 % of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \n \nTics associated with Tourette\u2019s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Tourette\u2019s disorder (aripiprazole: \nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 to 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \n7.09 in the placebo group. \n \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Tourette\u2019s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\nKorea. Patients were 6 to 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \n \nIn both of these short-term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long-term data are available with regard to the \nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 to 5 hours after \ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole. \n \nDistribution \n \nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \n4.9 L/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \naripiprazole AUC in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \n \nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 mL/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \nin the faeces. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nGender \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nSmoking \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \nrelevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment \naccumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day \n(3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased \nadrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at \n60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose). The \nhighest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended \ndose. \n \nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of \nhydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 mg/kg/day \nto 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical \ndose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the \nconcentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose \nproposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in \nthe 39-week study and are well below (6 %) their limits of in vitro solubility. \n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to \nthat observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse reactions on \ndevelopment. \n \nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-\ngenotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental \ntoxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were \nobserved in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses \nresulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended \nclinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years \nand older. \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nand for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic \nepisodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in \nBipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day with a \nmaintenance dose of 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. \nABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher \nthan a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a \nhigher dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg \nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination \ntherapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \nshould not exceed 30 mg. \n \nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/mL) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at \ndoses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may \nbenefit from a higher dose. \nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/mL) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nTics associated with Tourette\u2019s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nGender \nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \n \nSmoking status \nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nABILIFY is for oral use. \n \nThe orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in \nsaliva. It can be taken with or without liquid. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the \nmouth is difficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening \nthe blister. Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension. \n \nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nSuicidality \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nCardiovascular disorders \n \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nOther extrapyramidal symptoms \n \nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \nmonitoring should be considered. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \n \nSeizure \n \nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nIncreased mortality \nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56 to 99 years) of aripiprazole \nin elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with \naripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-\ntreated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths \nwere varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) \nor infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n \nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nWeight gain \n \nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n \nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nAspartame \n \nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame. Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be \nharmful for people with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds \nup because the body cannot remove it properly. \n \nLactose \n \nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \nSodium \n \nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain sodium. This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol \nsodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nPatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity \n \nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \n \nFalls \n \nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to its \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \n \nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \n \nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \nfor smokers. \n \nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \nAUC by 107 %, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \n \nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \naripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \n \nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax \nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and \nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \n \nValproate and lithium \nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \n \nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n \nIn clinical studies, 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \n \nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \nmedicinal products, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective serotonin noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI), or with medicinal products that are known to increase aripiprazole \nconcentrations (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAripiprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \ntabulated below. The table is based on adverse events reported during clinical trials and/or post-\nmarketing use. \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \nare derived from spontaneous reports.

In a long-term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \nwith lithium. In the long-term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \n \nAkathisia \nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \n \nDystonia \nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \nage groups. \n \nProlactin \nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \npatients who received placebo. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13 to 17 years) with \nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (\u2265 1/10), and dry \nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10). \nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was also similar except for the \nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10). \n \nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13 to 17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 29.5 % \nand 48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \nexposure of 5 mg to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females \n(< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \nIn two long-term trials with adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) \nwas 37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (\u2265 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \ntwitching, and dyskinesia. \n \nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %; 30 mg, 28.8 %; placebo, 1.7 %); and akathisia (incidences were \n10 mg, 12.1 %; 30 mg, 20.3 %; placebo, 1.7 %). \n \nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \n \nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with \nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \n \nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10 to 17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \nrespectively. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by \nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \noverdose. \n \nHaemodialysis \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 33 \n\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole\u2019s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \nantagonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin \n5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \naripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for \n2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor \nligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia \nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \n \nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale \n(MADRS) showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \nplacebo. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \n314 adult patients and where the primary endpoint was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \n33 % of evaluable patients). \n \nLipid parameters \nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \nHigh Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). \n \nProlactin \nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \n \nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \n \nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \n \nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \ndepression. \n \nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] and MADRS with \ntotal scores \u2264 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for \n12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % \ndecreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk \n(hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to \ndemonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome measure in Clinical Global \nImpression - Bipolar version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (SOI; mania) scores. In this trial, patients \nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents \nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), \npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \n \nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \n(n = 146; ages 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95 % confidence interval, 0.242 to \n0.879) in the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects \n13 to 14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of \nthe HR for the younger (13 to 14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of \nsubjects in that group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this \nestimation (ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a \ntreatment effect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup \n(aripiprazole, n = 69; placebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be \nconcluded in the older patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \n(10 to 17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) \nfor Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features and had a \nYMRS score \u2265 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in the primary efficacy analysis, \n139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \n \nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \n \nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \ntreated with placebo. \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \nflexible-dose (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, or 15 mg/day)] and \nin one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day \nafter one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of \npatients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy \ncompared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical \nrelevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes \nin prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled \ntrials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) in \naripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-\ncontrolled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13 to \n26-week stabilisation on aripiprazole (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were \neither maintained on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse \nrates at week 16 were 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n16 weeks (aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight \ngain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean \nincrease of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase \n(16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase \nin 17 % of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \n \nTics associated with Tourette\u2019s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Tourette\u2019s disorder (aripiprazole: \nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 to 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \n7.09 in the placebo group. \n \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Tourette\u2019s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\nKorea. Patients were 6 to 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \n \nIn both of these short-term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long-term data are available with regard to the \nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 to 5 hours after \ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole. \n \nDistribution \n \nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \n4.9 L/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \naripiprazole AUC in plasma. \n \nElimination \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n \nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \n \nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 mL/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \nin the faeces. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nGender \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nSmoking \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \nrelevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment \naccumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day \n(3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nadrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at \n60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose). The \nhighest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended \ndose. \n \nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of \nhydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 mg/kg/day \nto 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical \ndose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the \nconcentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose \nproposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in \nthe 39-week study and are well below (6 %) their limits of in vitro solubility. \n \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to \nthat observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse reactions on \ndevelopment. \n \nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-\ngenotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental \ntoxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were \nobserved in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses \nresulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended \nclinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nABILIFY 1 mg/mL oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL oral solution contains 1 mg of aripiprazole. \n \nExcipients with known effect (per mL) \n200 mg fructose, 400 mg sucrose, 1.8 mg methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218), 0.2 mg propyl \nparahydroxybenzoate (E 216) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution \nClear, colourless to light yellow liquid solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years \nand older. \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nand for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic \nepisodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in \nBipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day (i.e. 10 mL or \n15 mL solution/day) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule \nwithout regard to meals. ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day (i.e. 10 mL \nto 30 mL solution/day). Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been \ndemonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \nshould not exceed 30 mg. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg (i.e. \n15 mL solution/day) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy \nor combination therapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The \nmaximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \n \nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/mL) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at \ndoses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may \nbenefit from a higher dose. \nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/mL) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nTics associated with Tourette\u2019s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nGender \nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \n \nSmoking status \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nABILIFY is for oral use. \n \nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nSuicidality \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n\n\n\n 44 \n\n \nOther extrapyramidal symptoms \n \nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \nmonitoring should be considered. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \n \nSeizure \n \nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nIncreased mortality \nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56 to 99 years) of aripiprazole \nin elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with \naripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-\ntreated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths \nwere varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) \nor infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \n \nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nWeight gain \n \nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n \nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nFructose and sucrose \n \nThe oral solution contains fructose and sucrose. Fructose may damage teeth. Sucrose may be harmful \nto the teeth. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product. \n \nParahydroxybenzoate \n \nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate. May cause \nallergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \nSodium \n \nThe oral solution contains sodium. This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) \nper dosage unit, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nPatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity \n \nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \n\n\n\n 46 \n\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \n \nFalls \n \nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to its \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \n \nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \n \nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \nfor smokers. \n \nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \nAUC by 107 %, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \n \nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \naripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \n \nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax \nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and \nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \n \nValproate and lithium \nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \n \nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n \nIn clinical studies, 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \n \nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \nmedicinal products, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective serotonin noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI), or with medicinal products that are known to increase aripiprazole \nconcentrations (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAripiprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \ntabulated below. The table is based on adverse events reported during clinical trials and/or post-\nmarketing use. \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \nare derived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is qualified \nas \"not known\". \n \n Common Uncommon Not known \n\n \nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Leukopenia \nNeutropenia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Allergic reaction (e.g. \nanaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema including swollen \ntongue, tongue oedema, face \noedema, pruritus allergic, or \nurticaria) \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n Hyperprolactinaemia \n \n\nDiabetic hyperosmolar coma \nDiabetic ketoacidosis \n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nDiabetes mellitus Hyperglycaemia Hyponatremia \nAnorexia \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia \nAnxiety \nRestlessness \n\nDepression \nHypersexuality \n\nSuicide attempt, suicidal ideation \nand completed suicide (see \nsection 4.4) \nPathological gambling \nImpulse-control disorder \nBinge eating \nCompulsive shopping \nPoriomania \nAggression \nAgitation \nNervousness  \n\n\n\n 49 \n\n Common Uncommon Not known \n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nAkathisia \nExtrapyramidal \ndisorder \nTremor \nHeadache \nSedation \nSomnolence \nDizziness \n\nTardive dyskinesia \nDystonia \nRestless legs \nsyndrome \n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome \nGrand mal convulsion \nSerotonin syndrome \nSpeech disorder \n \n\nEye disorders Vision blurred Diplopia \nPhotophobia \n\nOculogyric crisis \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \n \n\nSudden death unexplained  \nTorsades de pointes \nVentricular arrhythmia \nCardiac arrest \nBradycardia \n\nVascular disorders  Orthostatic \nhypotension \n \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n(including pulmonary embolism \nand deep vein thrombosis) \nHypertension \nSyncope \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Hiccups Aspiration pneumonia \nLaryngospasm \nOropharyngeal spasm \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation \nDyspepsia \nNausea \nSalivary \nhypersecretion \nVomiting \n\n Pancreatitis \nDysphagia \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal discomfort \nStomach discomfort \n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Hepatic failure \nHepatitis \nJaundice \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Rash \nPhotosensitivity reaction \nAlopecia \nHyperhidrosis \nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia \nand Systemic Symptoms \n(DRESS) \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Rhabdomyolysis \nMyalgia \nStiffness \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary incontinence \nUrinary retention \n\nPregnancy, \npuerperium and \nperinatal conditions \n\n  Drug withdrawal syndrome \nneonatal (see section 4.6) \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n  Priapism \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n \n\n Temperature regulation disorder \n(e.g. hypothermia, pyrexia) \nChest pain \nPeripheral oedema \n\n\n\n 50 \n\n Common Uncommon Not known \n \n\nInvestigations   Weight decreased \nWeight gain \nAlanine Aminotransferase \nincreased \nAspartate Aminotransferase \nincreased \nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \nAlkaline phosphatase increased \nQT prolonged \nBlood glucose increased \nGlycosylated haemoglobin \nincreased \nBlood glucose fluctuation \nCreatine phosphokinase increased \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAdults \n \nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \nSchizophrenia: in a long-term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-\nlower incidence (25.8 %) of EPS including Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared \nwith those treated with haloperidol (57.3 %). In a long-term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \nwith lithium. In the long-term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \n \nAkathisia \nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \n \nDystonia \nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \nage groups. \n \nProlactin \nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \npatients who received placebo. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13 to 17 years) with \nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (\u2265 1/10), and dry \nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10). \nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was also similar except for the \nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10). \n \nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13 to 17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 29.5 % \nand 48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \nexposure of 5 mg to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females \n(< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \nIn two long-term trials with adolescent (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) \nwas 37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (\u2265 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \ntwitching, and dyskinesia. \n \nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %; 30 mg, 28.8 %; placebo, 1.7 %); and akathisia (incidences were \n10 mg, 12.1 %; 30 mg, 20.3 %; placebo, 1.7 %). \n \nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \n \nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with \nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \n \nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10 to 17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \nrespectively. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by \nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \noverdose. \n \nHaemodialysis \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole\u2019s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \nantagonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin \n5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \naripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for \n2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor \nligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 53 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia \nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \n \nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale \n(MADRS) showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \nplacebo. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \n314 adult patients and where the primary endpoint was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \n33 % of evaluable patients). \n \nLipid parameters \nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \nHigh Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). \n \nProlactin \nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \n \nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \n \nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \n \nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \ndepression. \n \nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] and MADRS with \ntotal scores \u2264 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for \n12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % \ndecreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk \n(hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to \ndemonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome measure in Clinical Global \nImpression - Bipolar version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (SOI; mania) scores. In this trial, patients \nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents \nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), \npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \n \nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \n(n = 146; ages 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95 % confidence interval, 0.242 to \n0.879) in the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects \n13 to 14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of \nthe HR for the younger (13 to 14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of \nsubjects in that group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this \nestimation (ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a \ntreatment effect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup \n(aripiprazole, n = 69; placebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be \nconcluded in the older patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \n\n\n\n 55 \n\n(10 to 17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) \nfor Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features and had a \nYMRS score \u2265 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in the primary efficacy analysis, \n139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \n \nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \ntreated with placebo. \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \nflexible-dose (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, or 15 mg/day)] and \nin one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day \nafter one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of \npatients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy \ncompared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical \nrelevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes \nin prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled \ntrials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/mL) and males (< 2 ng/mL) in \naripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-\ncontrolled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13 to \n26-week stabilisation on aripiprazole (2 mg/day to 15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were \neither maintained on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse \nrates at week 16 were 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within \n16 weeks (aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight \ngain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean \nincrease of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase \n(16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase \nin 17 % of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \n \nTics associated with Tourette\u2019s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Tourette\u2019s disorder (aripiprazole: \nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 to 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \n7.09 in the placebo group. \n \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Tourette\u2019s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\nKorea. Patients were 6 to 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \n \nIn both of these short-term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long-term data are available with regard to the \nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 to 5 hours after \ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole. \n \nDistribution \n \nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \n4.9 L/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \naripiprazole AUC in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \n \nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 mL/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \nin the faeces. \n \nOral Solution \nAripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the peak \nplasma concentrations of aripiprazole (Cmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic \nexposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the \npharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy \nsubjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122 % (n = 30). The single-\ndose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was linear and dose-proportional. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\n\n\n 57 \n\n \nElderly \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nGender \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nSmoking \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \nrelevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment \naccumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day \n(3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased \nadrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at \n60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose). The \nhighest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended \ndose. \n \nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of \nhydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 mg/kg/day \nto 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical \ndose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the \nconcentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose \nproposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in \nthe 39-week study and are well below (6 %) their limits of in vitro solubility. \n \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to \nthat observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse reactions on \ndevelopment. \n \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-\ngenotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental \ntoxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were \nobserved in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses \nresulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended \nclinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nABILIFY 7.5 mg/mL solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole. Each vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours \nin adult patients with schizophrenia or with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is \nnot appropriate. \n \nTreatment with ABILIFY solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically \nappropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended initial dose for ABILIFY solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 mL), administered \nas a single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of ABILIFY solution for injection is \n5.25 mg to 15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 mL) may be given, on the basis \nof individual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already \nadministered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). \n \nA second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual \nclinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period. \n \nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of ABILIFY). \n \nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics \nfor ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in children and adolescents aged 0 to \n17 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nGender \nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \n \nSmoking status \nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use. \n \nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus \nmaximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended. \n \nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. \n \nIt is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has \nnot been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I \nDisorder. \n \nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be \nassociated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine \ntherapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be \nmonitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients receiving ABILIFY solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. \nBlood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nalcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products). \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nSuicidality \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \nprolongation (see section 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nOther extrapyramidal symptoms \n \nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \nmonitoring should be considered. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \n \nSeizure \n \nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nIncreased mortality \nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56 to 99 years) of aripiprazole \nin elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with \naripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-\ntreated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths \nwere varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) \nor infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \n \nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nWeight gain \n \nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral \naripiprazole. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, \nthyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce \nclinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with \nbipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of \ntreatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain \nis clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \n\n\n\n 64 \n\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n \nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nSodium \n \nABILIFY solution for injection contains sodium. This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol \nsodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nPatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity \n \nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \n \nFalls \n \nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY solution for injection. The \ninformation below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. \n \nDue to its \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \n \nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY solution for injection \n \nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nABILIFY solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination \nas compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. \n \nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \n\n\n\n 65 \n\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \nfor smokers. \n \nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) \nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose \nshould be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration \nof aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and \nparoxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be \napplied. \n \nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \nincreased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \n \nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax \nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and \nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \n \nValproate and lithium \nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \n \nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n \nThe administration of ABILIFY solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nlorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the \ncombination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone. \n \nIn clinical studies, oral doses of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day of aripiprazole had no significant effect on \nthe metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \n\n\n\n 66 \n\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \n \nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \nmedicinal products, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/selective serotonin noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI), or with medicinal products that are known to increase aripiprazole \nconcentrations (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAripiprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were nausea, dizziness and \nsomnolence each occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for \ninjection. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n 67 \n\n \nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \ntabulated below. The table is based on adverse events reported during clinical trials and/or post-\nmarketing use. \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \nare derived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is qualified \nas \"not known\". \n \n Common Uncommon Not known \n\n \nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Leukopenia \nNeutropenia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Allergic reaction (e.g. \nanaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema including swollen \ntongue, tongue oedema, face \noedema, pruritus allergic, or \nurticaria) \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n Hyperprolactinaemia Diabetic hyperosmolar coma \nDiabetic ketoacidosis \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nDiabetes mellitus Hyperglycaemia Hyponatremia \nAnorexia \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia \nAnxiety \nRestlessness \n\nDepression \nHypersexuality \n\nSuicide attempt, suicidal ideation \nand completed suicide (see \nsection 4.4) \nPathological gambling \nImpulse-control disorder \nBinge eating \nCompulsive shopping \nPoriomania \nAggression \nAgitation \nNervousness  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nAkathisia \nExtrapyramidal \ndisorder \nTremor \nHeadache \nSedation \nSomnolence \nDizziness \n\nTardive dyskinesia \nDystonia \nRestless legs \nsyndrome \n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome \nGrand mal convulsion \nSerotonin syndrome \nSpeech disorder \n \n\nEye disorders Vision blurred Diplopia \nPhotophobia \n\nOculogyric crisis \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \n \n\nSudden death unexplained  \nTorsades de pointes \nVentricular arrhythmia \nCardiac arrest \nBradycardia \n\nVascular disorders  Orthostatic \nhypotension \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n(including pulmonary embolism \n\n\n\n 68 \n\n Common Uncommon Not known \n \nand deep vein thrombosis) \nHypertension \nSyncope \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Hiccups Aspiration pneumonia \nLaryngospasm \nOropharyngeal spasm \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation \nDyspepsia \nNausea \nSalivary \nhypersecretion \nVomiting \n\nMouth dry Pancreatitis \nDysphagia \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal discomfort \nStomach discomfort \n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Hepatic failure \nHepatitis \nJaundice \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Rash \nPhotosensitivity reaction \nAlopecia \nHyperhidrosis \nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia \nand Systemic Symptoms \n(DRESS) \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Rhabdomyolysis \nMyalgia \nStiffness \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary incontinence \nUrinary retention \n\nPregnancy, \npuerperium and \nperinatal conditions \n\n  Drug withdrawal syndrome \nneonatal (see section 4.6) \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n  Priapism \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n \n\n Temperature regulation disorder \n(e.g. hypothermia, pyrexia) \nChest pain \nPeripheral oedema \n\nInvestigations  Diastolic blood \npressure increased \n\nWeight decreased \nWeight gain \nAlanine Aminotransferase \nincreased \nAspartate Aminotransferase \nincreased \nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \nAlkaline phosphatase increased \nQT prolonged \nBlood glucose increased \nGlycosylated haemoglobin \nincreased \nBlood glucose fluctuation \nCreatine phosphokinase increased \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n \nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \nSchizophrenia: in a long-term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-\nlower incidence (25.8 %) of EPS including Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared \nwith those treated with haloperidol (57.3 %). In a long-term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \nwith lithium. In the long-term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \n \nAkathisia \nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \n \nDystonia \nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \nage groups. \n \nProlactin \nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \npatients who received placebo. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose associated with adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies with \nABILIFY solution for injection. Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of this medicinal \nproduct into a blood vessel. Following any confirmed or suspected accidental overdose/inadvertent \nintravenous administration, close observation of the patient is needed and if any potentially medically \nserious sign or symptom develops, monitoring, which should include continuous electrocardiographic \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 70 \n\nmonitoring, is required. The medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient \nrecovers. \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by \nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \noverdose. \n \nHaemodialysis \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole\u2019s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \nantagonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin \n5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \naripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for \n2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor \nligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n\n\n 71 \n\n \nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with ABILIFY solution for injection \nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients \npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFYsolution for injection was associated \nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \nplacebo and was similar to haloperidol. \n \nIn one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder \npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFY solution for injection was associated \nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \nplacebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from \nbaseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for \nplacebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for ABILIFY solution for injection. In subpopulation analyses on \npatients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the \noverall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced \nsample size. \n \nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole \nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with \nstatistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \n \nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \ngroups (oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly \nhigher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 %) than for oral haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating \nscales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating \nScale (MADRS) showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral \naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and \n57 % in placebo. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \n314 adult patients and where the primary endpoint was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \n~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine \n(n = 45, or 33 % of evaluable patients). \n \nLipid parameters \nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \nHigh Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). \n \nProlactin \nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \n \nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \n \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole \nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \n \nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \n \nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \ndepression. \n \nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] and MADRS with \ntotal scores \u2264 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for \n12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % \ndecreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk \n(hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to \ndemonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole \ndemonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome measure in Clinical Global \nImpression - Bipolar version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (SOI; mania) scores. In this trial, patients \nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAripiprazole administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and \nhas an absolute bioavailability of 100 %. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an \nintramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic \nexposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median \ntimes to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing. \n\n\n\n 73 \n\n \nDistribution \n \nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 L/kg, indicating extensive \nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \naripiprazole AUC in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \n \nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 mL/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \nin the faeces. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nGender \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nschizophrenic patients. \n \nSmoking \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation of oral aripiprazole has revealed no evidence of clinically \nrelevant effects from smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \n\n\n\n 74 \n\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of ABILIFY solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target \norgan toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures (AUC) that were 15 and \n5 times, respectively, human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg \nintramuscular. In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies, no new safety concerns were observed at \nmaternal exposures up to 15 (rat) and 29 (rabbit) times human exposure at 30 mg. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \nrelevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment \naccumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day \n(3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased \nadrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at \n60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose). The \nhighest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended \ndose. \n \nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of \nhydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 mg/kg/day \nto 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical \ndose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the \nconcentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose \nproposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in \nthe 39-week study and are well below (6 %) their limits of in vitro solubility. \n \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to \nthat observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse reactions on \ndevelopment. \n \nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-\ngenotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental \ntoxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were \nobserved in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses \nresulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended \nclinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity. \n \n \n6.

It is especially important to mention the following to your doctor: \n \n\u2022 medicines to correct heart rhythm (such as quinidine, amiodarone, flecainide) \n\u2022 antidepressants or herbal remedy used to treat depression and anxiety (such as fluoxetine, \n\nparoxetine, venlafaxine, St. John's Wort) \n\u2022 antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole) \n\u2022 certain medicines to treat HIV infection (such as efavirenz, nevirapine, an protease inhibitors \n\ne.g. indinavir, ritonavir) \n\u2022 anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) \n\u2022 certain antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis (rifabutin, rifampicin) \n \nThese medicines may increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effect of ABILIFY; if you get any \nunusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with ABILIFY you should see your doctor. \n\n\n\n 136 \n\n \nMedicines that increase the level of serotonin are typically used in conditions including depression, \ngeneralised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia as well as \nmigraine and pain: \n \n\u2022 triptans, tramadol and tryptophan used for conditions including depression, generalised anxiety \n\ndisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia as well as migraine and pain \n\u2022 selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors (SSRIs) (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine) used for \n\ndepression, OCD, panic and anxiety \n\u2022 other anti-depressants (such as venlafaxine and tryptophan) used in major depression \n\u2022 tricyclic\u2019s (such as clomipramine and amitriptyline) used for depressive illness \n\u2022 St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) used as a herbal remedy for mild depression \n\u2022 pain killers (such as tramadol and pethidine) used for pain relief \n\u2022 triptans (such as sumatriptan and zolmitripitan) used for treating migraine \n \nThese medicines may increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking any of \nthese medicines together with ABILIFY, you should see your doctor. \n \nA combination of ABILIFY with medicines taken for anxiety might make you feel drowsy or dizzy. \nOnly take other medicines while you are on ABILIFY if your doctor tells you that you can. \n \nABILIFY with food, drink and alcohol \nThis medicine can be given regardless of meals. \nAlcohol should be avoided. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThe following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, of mothers that have used ABILIFY in the last \ntrimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, \nagitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these symptoms \nyou may need to contact your doctor. \n \nIf you are receiving ABILIFY, your doctor will discuss with you whether you should breast-feed \nconsidering the benefit to you of your therapy and the benefit to your baby of breast-feeding. You \nshould not do both. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you are receiving this \nmedicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see section 4). \nThis should be considered in cases where full alertness is required, e.g., when driving a car or handling \nmachines. \n \nABILIFY contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How ABILIFY is given \n \nYour doctor will decide how much ABILIFY you need and how long you need it for. The \nrecommended dose is 9.75 mg (1.3 mL) for the first injection. Up to three injections in 24 hours may \nbe given. The total dose of ABILIFY (all formulations) should not exceed 30 mg per day. \n \nABILIFY is ready to use. The correct amount of solution will be injected into your muscle by your \ndoctor or nurse. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder\n\n\n 137 \n\n \nIf you are given more ABILIFY than you need \nThis medicine will be given to you under medical supervision; it is therefore unlikely that you will be \ngiven too much. If you see more than one doctor, be sure to tell them that you are receiving ABILIFY. \n \nPatients who have been given too much aripiprazole have experienced the following symptoms: \n\u2022 rapid heartbeat, agitation/aggressiveness, problems with speech. \n\u2022 unusual movements (especially of the face or tongue) and reduced level of consciousness. \n \nOther symptoms may include: \n\u2022 acute confusion, seizures (epilepsy), coma, a combination of fever, faster breathing, sweating, \n\u2022 muscle stiffness, and drowsiness or sleepiness, slower breathing, choking, high or low blood \n\npressure, abnormal rhythms of the heart. \n \nContact your doctor or hospital immediately if you experience any of the above. \n \nIf you miss an injection of ABILIFY \nIt is important not to miss your dose. If you miss an injection, you should contact your doctor to \narrange your next injection as soon as you can. \n \nIf you stop receiving ABILIFY \nDo not stop your treatment just because you feel better. It is important that you carry on receiving \nABILIFY solution for injection for as long as your doctor has told you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.
