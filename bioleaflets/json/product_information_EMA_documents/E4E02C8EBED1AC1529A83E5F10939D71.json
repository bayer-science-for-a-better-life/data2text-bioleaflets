CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNINLARO in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of multiple myeloma.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose of ixazomib is 4 mg administered orally once a week on Days 1, 8, \nand 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle.  \n \nThe recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg administered daily on Days 1 to 21 of a \n28-day treatment cycle.  \n \nThe recommended starting dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a \n28-day treatment cycle. \n\nFor additional information regarding lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics (SmPC) for these medicinal products. \n \nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: \n•  Absolute neutrophil count should be ≥ 1,000/mm3 \n• Platelet count should be ≥ 75,000/mm3 \n• Non-haematologic toxicities should, at the physician’s discretion, generally be recovered to \n\npatient’s baseline condition or ≤ Grade 1 \n \nTreatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with \nixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for longer than 24 cycles should be \nbased on an individual benefit risk assessment, as the data on the tolerability and toxicity beyond \n24 cycles are limited (see section 5.1). \n \nDelayed or missed doses  \n \nIn the event that a ixazomib dose is delayed or missed, the dose should be taken only if the next \nscheduled dose is ≥ 72 hours away. A missed dose should not be taken within 72 hours of the next \nscheduled dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nIf a patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume dosing \nat the time of the next scheduled dose. \n \nDose modifications \n \nThe ixazomib dose reduction steps are presented in Table 1 and the dose modification guidelines are \nprovided in Table 2.  \n \n\nDosing schedule: Ixazomib taken with lenalidomide and dexamethasone \n28-day cycle (a 4-week cycle) \n Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 \n Day 1 Days  \n\n2 to 7 \nDay 8 Days  \n\n9 to 14 \nDay \n15 \n\nDays  \n16 to 21 \n\nDay \n22 \n\nDays 23 \nto 28 \n\nIxazomib         \nLenalidomide  Daily  Daily  Daily   \nDexamethasone         \n= intake of medicinal product \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1: Ixazomib dose reduction steps \nRecommended starting dose*  First reduction to Second reduction to Discontinue 4 mg 3 mg 2.3 mg \n*Recommended reduced dose of 3 mg in the presence of moderate or severe hepatic impairment, severe renal \n\nimpairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. \n \nAn alternating dose modification approach is recommended for ixazomib and lenalidomide for \noverlapping toxicities of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and rash. For these toxicities, the first dose \nmodification step is to withhold/reduce lenalidomide. Refer to the lenalidomide SmPC, section 4.2 for \nthe dose reduction steps for these toxicities. \n \n\nTable 2: Dose modifications guidelines for ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and \ndexamethasone  \nHaematological toxicities Recommended actions \nThrombocytopenia (platelet count) \nPlatelet count < 30,000/mm3 • Withhold ixazomib and lenalidomide until platelet count \n\n≥ 30,000/mm3. \n• Following recovery, resume lenalidomide at the next lower \n\ndose according to its SmPC and resume ixazomib at its most \nrecent dose.  \n\n• If platelet count falls to < 30,000/mm3 again, withhold \nixazomib and lenalidomide until platelet count \n≥ 30,000/mm3. \n\n• Following recovery, resume ixazomib at the next lower dose \nand resume lenalidomide at its most recent dose.* \n\nNeutropenia (absolute neutrophil count) \nAbsolute neutrophil count \n< 500/mm3 \n\n• Withhold ixazomib and lenalidomide until absolute \nneutrophil count is ≥ 500/mm3. Consider adding G-CSF as \nper clinical guidelines. \n\n• Following recovery, resume lenalidomide at the next lower \ndose according to its prescribing information and resume \nixazomib at its most recent dose.  \n\n• If absolute neutrophil count falls to < 500/mm3 again, \nwithhold ixazomib and lenalidomide until absolute \nneutrophil count is ≥ 500/mm3. \n\n• Following recovery, resume ixazomib at the next lower dose \nand resume lenalidomide at its most recent dose.* \n\n\n\n5 \n\nNon-haematological toxicities Recommended actions \nRash \nGrade† 2 or 3 \n \n\n• Withhold lenalidomide until rash recovers to ≤ Grade 1. \n• Following recovery, resume lenalidomide at the next lower \n\ndose according to its SmPC.  \n• If Grade 2 or 3 rash occurs again, withhold ixazomib and \n\nlenalidomide until rash recovers to ≤ Grade 1. \n• Following recovery, resume ixazomib at the next lower dose \n\nand resume lenalidomide at its most recent dose.* \nGrade 4 Discontinue treatment regimen. \nPeripheral neuropathy \nGrade 1 peripheral neuropathy with \npain or Grade 2 peripheral \nneuropathy \n\n• Withhold ixazomib until peripheral neuropathy recovers to \n≤ Grade 1 without pain or patient's baseline. \n\n• Following recovery, resume ixazomib at its most recent \ndose. \n\nGrade 2 peripheral neuropathy with \npain or Grade 3 peripheral \nneuropathy \n \n \n\n• Withhold ixazomib. Toxicities should, at the physician’s \ndiscretion, generally recover to patient’s baseline condition \nor ≤ Grade 1 prior to resuming ixazomib. \n\n• Following recovery, resume ixazomib at the next lower \ndose. \n\nGrade 4 peripheral neuropathy Discontinue treatment regimen. \nOther non-haematological toxicities \nOther Grade 3 or 4 \nnon-haematological toxicities \n\n• Withhold ixazomib. Toxicities should, at the physician’s \ndiscretion, generally recover to patient’s baseline condition \nor at most Grade 1 prior to resuming ixazomib. \n\n• If attributable to ixazomib, resume ixazomib at the next \nlower dose following recovery. \n\n*For additional occurrences, alternate dose modification of lenalidomide and ixazomib \n†Grading based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) Version 4.03 \n\n \nConcomitant medicinal products \n \nAntiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients being treated with ixazomib to decrease the risk \nof herpes zoster reactivation. Patients included in studies with ixazomib who received antiviral \nprophylaxis had a lower incidence of herpes zoster infection compared to patients who did not receive \nprophylaxis. \n \nThromboprophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with ixazomib in combination with \nlenalidomide and dexamethasone, and should be based on an assessment of the patient’s underlying \nrisks and clinical status.  \n \nFor other concomitant medicinal products that may be required, refer to the current lenalidomide and \ndexamethasone SmPC. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment of ixazomib is required for patients over 65 years of age.  \n \nDiscontinuations in patients > 75 years of age were reported in 13 patients (28%) in the ixazomib \nregimen and 10 patients (16%) in the placebo regimen. Cardiac arrhythmias in patients > 75 years of \nage were observed in 10 patients (21%) in the ixazomib regimen and 9 patients (15%) in the placebo \nregimen.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment of ixazomib is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \n≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or total bilirubin \n> 1-1.5 x ULN and any AST). The reduced dose of 3 mg is recommended in patients with moderate \n(total bilirubin > 1.5-3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN) hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment of ixazomib is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min). The reduced dose of 3 mg is recommended in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \ndialysis. Ixazomib is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of \ndialysis (see section 5.2). \n \nRefer to the lenalidomide SmPC for dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of ixazomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIxazomib is for oral use. \n \nIxazomib should be taken at approximately the same time on days 1, 8, and 15 of each treatment cycle \nat least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after food (see section 5.2). The capsule should be swallowed \nwhole with water. It should not be crushed, chewed, or opened (see section 6.6).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nAs ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC \nfor these medicinal products for additional contraindications. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC \nfor these medicinal products for additional special warnings and precautions for use. \n \nThrombocytopenia \n \nThrombocytopenia has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8) with platelet nadirs typically \noccurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next \ncycle (see section 4.8).  \n \nPlatelet counts should be monitored at least monthly during ixazomib treatment. More frequent \nmonitoring should be considered during the first three cycles as per the lenalidomide SmPC. \nThrombocytopenia can be managed with dose modifications (see section 4.2) and platelet transfusions \nas per standard medical guidelines.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGastrointestinal toxicities \n \nDiarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting have been reported with ixazomib, occasionally \nrequiring use of antiemetic and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products and supportive care (see \nsection 4.8). The dose should be adjusted for severe (Grade 3-4) symptoms (see section 4.2). In case of \nsevere gastrointestinal events, monitoring of serum potassium level is recommended. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n \nPeripheral neuropathy has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). The patient should be \nmonitored for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral \nneuropathy may require dose modification (see section 4.2). \n \nPeripheral oedema \n \nPeripheral oedema has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). The patient should be evaluated \nfor underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. The dose of dexamethasone should be \nadjusted per its prescribing information or ixazomib for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (see section 4.2). \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nRash has been reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). Rash should be managed with supportive care \nor with dose modification if Grade 2 or higher (see section 4.2). \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), \nhave been reported in patients who received ixazomib. Some of these events have been fatal. Signs \nand symptoms of TMA should be monitored for. If the diagnosis is suspected, stop ixazomib and \nevaluate patients for possible TMA. If the diagnosis of TMA is excluded, ixazomib can be restarted. \nThe safety of reinitiating ixazomib therapy in patients previously experiencing TMA is not known. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nDrug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, hepatitis cholestatic and \nhepatotoxicity have been uncommonly reported with ixazomib (see section 4.8). Hepatic enzymes \nshould be monitored regularly and the dose should be adjusted for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nWomen should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with ixazomib. If ixazomib is used \nduring pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking ixazomib, the patient should be \napprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking ixazomib and \nfor 90 days after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). Women using hormonal contraceptives \nshould additionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has occurred in patients receiving ixazomib. \nPRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with seizure, hypertension, \nheadache, altered consciousness, and visual disturbances. Brain imaging, preferably Magnetic \nResonance Imaging, is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing PRES, discontinue \nixazomib.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nStrong CYP3A inducers \n \nStrong inducers may reduce the efficacy of ixazomib, therefore the concomitant use of strong CYP3A \ninducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), \nshould be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). Closely monitor patients for disease control if \nco-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nCYP inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of ixazomib with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not result in a \nclinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib. Ixazomib Cmax was decreased by \n4% and AUC was increased by 11%. Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with \nco-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors. \n \nCo-administration of ixazomib with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not result in a clinically meaningful \nchange in the systemic exposure of ixazomib based on the results of a population pharmacokinetic \n(PK) analysis. Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with co-administration of \nstrong CYP1A2 inhibitors. \n \nCYP inducers \n \nCo-administration of ixazomib with rifampicin decreased ixazomib Cmax by 54% and AUC by 74%. \nTherefore, co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nEffect of ixazomib on other medicinal products \n \nIxazomib is not a reversible or a time-dependent inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, \nor 3A4/5. Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity or corresponding \nimmunoreactive protein levels. Ixazomib is not expected to produce drug-drug interactions via \nCYP inhibition or induction. \n \nTransporter-based interactions \n \nIxazomib is a low affinity substrate of P-gp. Ixazomib is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2 or hepatic \nOATPs. Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, \nOAT3, MATE1, or MATE2-K. Ixazomib is not expected to cause transporter-mediated drug-drug \ninteractions.  \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nWhen ixazomib is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to \nmoderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy \nof oral contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using hormonal contraceptives should \nadditionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC \nfor these medicinal products for additional information on fertility, pregnancy and lactation. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nMale and female patients who are able to have children must use effective contraceptive measures \nduring and for 90 days following treatment. Ixazomib is not recommended in women of childbearing \npotential not using contraception. \n \nWhen ixazomib is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to \nmoderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy \nof oral contraceptives needs to be considered. Therefore, women using oral hormonal contraceptives \nshould additionally use a barrier method of contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIxazomib is not recommended during pregnancy as it can cause foetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman. Therefore, women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with \nixazomib.  \n \nThere are no data for the use of ixazomib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nIxazomib is given in combination with lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is structurally related to \nthalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe \nlife-threatening birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect in humans \nis expected. The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme for lenalidomide must be fulfilled \nfor all patients unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. \nPlease refer to the current lenalidomide SmPC. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ixazomib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. No animal data are \navailable. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded and therefore breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nIxazomib will be given in combination with lenalidomide and breast-feeding should be stopped \nbecause of the use of lenalidomide. \n \nFertility \n \nFertility studies have not been conducted with ixazomib (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIxazomib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Fatigue and dizziness have been \nobserved in clinical trials. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines if they \nexperience any of these symptoms. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAs ixazomib is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC \nfor these medicinal products for additional undesirable effects. \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of NINLARO is based on available clinical trial data and post-marketing experience \nto date. Frequencies of adverse reactions described below and in Table 3 have been determined based \non data generated from clinical studies. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nUnless otherwise noted, the data presented below is the pooled safety data from the pivotal, Phase 3, \nglobal C16010 study (n=720) and the double-blind, placebo-controlled C16010 China Continuation \nStudy (n=115). The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) across 417 patients treated \nwithin the ixazomib regimen and 418 patients within the placebo regimen were diarrhoea (39% vs. \n32%), thrombocytopenia (33% vs. 21%), neutropenia (33% vs. 30%), constipation (30% vs. 22%), \nperipheral neuropathy (25% vs. 20%), nausea (23% vs. 18%), peripheral oedema (23% vs. 17%), \nvomiting (20% vs. 10%) and upper respiratory tract infection (21% vs. 16%). Serious adverse \nreactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhoea (2%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention is used for the classification of the frequency of an adverse drug reaction \n(ADR): very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent \nreactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions in patients treated with ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide \nand dexamethasone (all grades, grade 3 and grade 4)  \nSystem organ class / \nAdverse reaction \n\nAdverse reactions \n(all grades) \n\nGrade 3 adverse \nreactions \n\nGrade 4 adverse \nreactions \n\nInfections and infestations \nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection \n\nVery common Uncommon  \n\nHerpes zoster Common Common  \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nThrombocytopenia* Very common Very common Common \nNeutropenia* Very common Very common Common \nThrombotic \nmicroangiopathy \n\nRare  Rare \n\nThrombotic \nthrombocytopenic \npurpura† \n\nRare Rare Rare \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nTumour lysis syndrome† Rare Rare Rare \nNervous system disorders \nPeripheral neuropathies* Very common Common  \nPosterior reversible \nencephalopathy \ndisorders*† \n\nRare Rare Rare \n\nTransverse myelitis† Rare Rare  \nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhoea Very common Common  \nNausea Very common Common  \nVomiting Very common Uncommon  \nConstipation Very common Uncommon  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nRash* Very common Common  \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome† \n\nRare Rare  \n\nAcute febrile neutrophilic \ndermatosis \n\nRare Rare  \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nBack pain Very common  Uncommon  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSystem organ class / \nAdverse reaction \n\nAdverse reactions \n(all grades) \n\nGrade 3 adverse \nreactions \n\nGrade 4 adverse \nreactions \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nOedema peripheral Very common Common  \nNote: ADRs included as preferred terms are based on MedDRA version 16.0. \n*Represents a pooling of preferred terms \n†Reported outside of the Phase 3 studies \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDiscontinuations \n \nFor each adverse reaction, one or more of the three medicinal products was discontinued in ≤ 1% of \npatients in the ixazomib regimen. \n \nThrombocytopenia \n \nThree percent of patients in the ixazomib regimen and 1% of patients in the placebo regimen had a \nplatelet count ≤ 10,000/mm3 during treatment. Less than 1% of patients in both regimens had a platelet \ncount ≤ 5,000/mm3 during treatment. Thrombocytopenia resulted in discontinuation of one or more of \nthe three medicinal products in < 1% of patients in the ixazomib regimen and 1% of patients in the \nplacebo regimen. Thrombocytopenia did not result in an increase in haemorrhagic events or platelet \ntransfusions. \n \nGastrointestinal toxicities \n \nDiarrhoea resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal products in 1% of patients \nin the ixazomib regimen and < 1% of patients in the placebo regimen. \n \nRash \n \nRash occurred in 18% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 10% of patients in the placebo \nregimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular \nrash. Grade 3 rash was reported in 2% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 1% of patients \nin the placebo regimen. Rash resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal \nproducts in < 1% of patients in both regimens. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n \nPeripheral neuropathy occurred in 25% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 20% of \npatients in the placebo regimen. Grade 3 adverse reactions of peripheral neuropathy were reported in \n2% of patients in both regimens. The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory \nneuropathy (16% and 12% in the ixazomib and placebo regimen, respectively). Peripheral motor \nneuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen (< 1%). Peripheral neuropathy resulted in \ndiscontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal products in 1% of patients in the ixazomib \nregimen compared to < 1% of patients in the placebo regimen. \n \nEye disorders  \n \nEye disorders were reported with many different preferred terms but in aggregate, the frequency was \n24% in patients in the ixazomib regimen and 15% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most \ncommon adverse reactions were blurred vision (5% in the ixazomib regimen and 4% in the placebo \nregimen), dry eye (4% in the ixazomib regimen and 1% in the placebo regimen), conjunctivitis (5% in \nthe ixazomib regimen and 1% in the placebo regimen) and cataract (4% in the ixazomib regimen and \n5% in the placebo regimen). Grade 3 adverse reactions were reported in 2% of patients in both \nregimens. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nOther adverse reactions \n \nIn the pooled dataset from the pivotal, Phase 3, global C16010 study (n=720) and the double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, C16010 China Continuation Study (n=115), the following adverse reactions \noccurred with a similar rate between the ixazomib and placebo regimens: fatigue (26% vs. 24%), \ndecreased appetite (12% vs. 9%), hypotension (4% each), heart failure† (3% each), arrhythmia† (12% \nvs. 11%), and liver impairment including enzyme changes† (8% vs. 6%). \n \nThe frequency of severe (Grade 3-4) events of hypokalaemia was higher in the ixazomib regimen \n(5%) than the placebo regimen (< 1%).  \n \nFungal and viral pneumonia resulting in fatal outcome were rarely reported in patients given the \nixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination. \n \n† Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs) \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose. Clinical data is limited but doses up to \n12 mg have been reported in the randomised controlled trial. In the event of an overdose, monitor the \npatient for adverse reactions (section 4.8) and provide appropriate supportive care. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX50 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIxazomib citrate, a prodrug, is a substance that rapidly hydrolyses under physiological conditions to its \nbiologically active form, ixazomib.  \n \nIxazomib is an oral, highly selective and reversible proteasome inhibitor. Ixazomib preferentially \nbinds and inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the beta 5 subunit of the 20S proteasome.  \n \nIxazomib induced apoptosis of several tumour cell types in vitro. Ixazomib demonstrated in vitro \ncytotoxicity against myeloma cells from patients who had relapsed after multiple prior therapies, \nincluding bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. The combination of ixazomib and \nlenalidomide demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma cell lines. In vivo, \nixazomib demonstrated antitumour activity in various tumour xenograft models, including models of \nmultiple myeloma. In vitro, ixazomib affected cell types found in the bone marrow microenvironment \nincluding vascular endothelial cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nIxazomib did not prolong the QTc interval at clinically relevant exposures based on the results of a \npharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of data from 245 patients. At the 4 mg dose, \nmean change from baseline in QTcF was estimated to be 0.07 msec (90% CI; -0.22, 0.36) from the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nmodel based analysis. There was no discernible relationship between ixazomib concentration and the \nRR interval suggesting no clinically meaningful effect of ixazomib on heart rate. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was \nevaluated in an international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 \nsuperiority study (C16010) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who had \nreceived at least one prior therapy. A total of 722 patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) were \nrandomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and \ndexamethasone (N=360; ixazomib regimen) or placebo, lenalidomide and dexamethasone \n(N=362; placebo regimen) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients enrolled in the \ntrial had multiple myeloma that was refractory, including primary refractory, had relapsed after prior \ntherapy, or had relapsed and was refractory to any prior therapy. Patients that changed therapies prior \nto disease progression were eligible for enrolment, as well as those with controlled cardiovascular \nconditions. The Phase 3 study excluded patients who were refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome \ninhibitors and patients who received more than three prior therapies. For the purposes of this study, \nrefractory disease was defined as disease progression on treatment or progression within 60 days after \nthe last dose of lenalidomide or a proteasome inhibitor. As data are limited in these patients, a careful \nrisk-benefit assessment is recommended before initiating the ixazomib regimen. \n \nThromboprophylaxis was recommended for all patients in both treatment groups according to the \nlenalidomide SmPC. Concomitant medicinal products, such as antiemetic, antiviral, and antihistamine \nmedicinal products were given to patients at the physician's discretion as prophylaxis and/or \nmanagement of symptoms.  \n \nPatients received ixazomib 4 mg or placebo on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 \nthrough 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients with renal \nimpairment received a starting dose of lenalidomide according to its SmPC. Treatment continued until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicities. \n \nThe baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the \nstudy regimens. The median age was 66 years, range 38-91 years; 58% of patients were older than \n65 years. Fifty seven percent of patients were male. Eighty five percent of the population was White, \n9% Asian and 2% Black. Ninety three percent of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 and \n12% had baseline ISS stage III disease (N=90). Twenty five percent of patients had a creatinine \nclearance of < 60 mL/min. Twenty three percent of patients had light chain disease and 12% of \npatients had measurable disease by free light chain assay only. Nineteen percent had high-risk \ncytogenetic abnormalities (del[17], t[4;14], t[14;16]) (N=137), 10% had del(17) (N=69) and 34% had \n1q amplification (1q21) (N=247). Patients received one to three prior therapies (median of 1) \nincluding prior treatment with bortezomib (69%), carfilzomib (< 1%), thalidomide (45%), \nlenalidomide (12%), melphalan (81%). Fifty seven percent of patients had undergone prior stem cell \ntransplantation. Seventy seven percent of patients relapsed after prior therapies and 11% were \nrefractory to prior therapies. Primary refractory, defined as best response of stable disease or disease \nprogression on all prior therapies, was documented in 6% of patients. \n \nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) according to the 2011 International \nMyeloma Working Group (IMWG) Consensus Uniform Response Criteria as assessed by a blinded \nindependent review committee (IRC) based on central laboratory results. Response was assessed every \n4 weeks until disease progression. At the primary analysis (median follow up of 14.7 months and a \nmedian of 13 cycles), PFS was statistically significantly different between the treatment arms. PFS \nresults are summarised in Table 4 and Figure 1. The improvement in PFS in the ixazomib regimen was \nsupported by improvements in overall response rate. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 4: Progression free survival and response Results in multiple myeloma patients treated \nwith ixazomib or placebo in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (intent-to-treat \npopulation) \n Ixazomib + Lenalidomide and \n\nDexamethasone \n(N = 360) \n\nPlacebo + Lenalidomide and \nDexamethasone \n(N = 362) \n\nProgression-Free Survival \nEvents, n (%) 129 (36) 157 (43) \nMedian (months) 20.6 14.7 \np-value* 0.012 \nHazard Ratio† \n(95% CI) \n\n0.74 \n(0.59, 0.94) \n\nOverall Response Rate‡, n (%)  282 (78.3) 259 (71.5) \nResponse Category, n (%) \nComplete Response  42 (11.7) 24 (6.6) \nVery Good Partial Response  131 (36.4) 117 (32.3) \nPartial Response  109 (30.3) 118 (32.6) \nTime to Response, months \nMedian 1.1 1.9 \nDuration of Response§, months \nMedian 20.5 15.0 \n*P-value is based on the stratified log-rank test. \n†Hazard ratio is based on a stratified Cox’s proportional hazard regression model.

Median overall \nsurvival was not reached in either regimen. At this analysis, estimated median PFS was 20 months in \nthe ixazomib regimen and 15.9 months in the placebo regimen (HR=0.82 [95% CI (0.67, 1.0)]) in the \nITT population. \n \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study was conducted in China (N=115) with \na similar study design and eligibility criteria.

At the primary analysis (median \nfollow up of 8 months and a median of 6 cycles), the median PFS was 6.7 months in the ixazomib \nregimen compared to 4 months in the placebo regimen (p-value=0.035, HR=0.60). At the final \nanalysis for OS at a median follow up of 19.8 months, OS was improved for patients treated in the \nixazomib regimen compared with placebo [p-value=0.0014, HR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.242, 0.726 ]). \n \nAs multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease, benefit may vary across subgroups in the Phase 3 \nstudy (C16010) (see Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2: Forest plot of progression-free survival in subgroups \n\n \n \nIn the Phase 3 study (C16010), 10 patients (5 in each treatment regimen) had severe renal impairment \nat baseline. Of the 5 patients in the ixazomib regimen, one patient had a confirmed partial response \nand 3 confirmed stable disease (however 2 were unconfirmed partial response and 1 was an \nunconfirmed very good partial response). Of the 5 patients in the placebo regimen, 2 had a confirmed \nvery good partial response. \n \nQuality of life as assessed by global health scores (EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY-20) was maintained \nduring treatment and was similar in both treatment regimens in the Phase 3 study (C16010). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nixazomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of ixazomib were achieved at approximately \none hour after dosing. The mean absolute oral bioavailability is 58%. Ixazomib AUC increases in a \ndose proportional manner over a dose range of 0.2-10.6 mg.  \n \nAdministration with a high-fat meal decreased ixazomib AUC by 28% compared with administration \nafter an overnight fast (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \n \nIxazomib is 99% bound to plasma proteins and distributes into red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma \nAUC ratio of 10. The steady-state volume of distribution is 543 L.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAfter oral administration of a radiolabeled dose, 70% of total drug-related material in plasma was \naccounted for by ixazomib. Metabolism by multiple CYP enzymes and non-CYP proteins is expected \nto be the major clearance mechanism for ixazomib. At clinically relevant ixazomib concentrations, \nin vitro studies using human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes indicate that no specific \nCYP isozyme predominantly contributes to ixazomib metabolism and non-CYP proteins contribute to \noverall metabolism. At concentrations exceeding those observed clinically, ixazomib was metabolized \nby multiple CYP isoforms with estimated relative contributions of 3A4 (42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), \n2B6 (16.0%), 2C8 (6.0%), 2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 (4.8%) and 2C9 (< 1%). \n \nElimination \n \nIxazomib exhibits a multi-exponential disposition profile. Based on a population PK analysis, systemic \nclearance (CL) was approximately 1.86 L/hr with inter-individual variability of 44%. The terminal \nhalf-life (t1/2) of ixazomib was 9.5 days. Approximately 2-fold accumulation in AUC was observed \nwith weekly oral dosing on Day 15. \n \nExcretion \n \nAfter administration of a single oral dose of 14C-ixazomib to 5 patients with advanced cancer, 62% of \nthe administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 22% in the faeces. Unchanged ixazomib \naccounted for < 3.5% of the administered dose recovered in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with mild \nhepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1-1.5 x ULN and any \nAST) based on the results of a population PK analysis.  \n \nThe PK of ixazomib was characterized in patients with normal hepatic function at 4 mg (N=12), \nmoderate hepatic impairment at 2.3 mg (total bilirubin > 1.5-3 x ULN, N=13) or severe hepatic \nimpairment at 1.5 mg (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, N=18). Unbound dose-normalized AUC was \n27% higher in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as compared to patients with \nnormal hepatic function (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nThe PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min) based on the results of a population PK \nanalysis.  \n \nThe PK of ixazomib was characterized at a dose of 3 mg in patients with normal renal function \n(creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/min, N=18), severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 30 mL/min, N=14), or ESRD requiring dialysis (N=6). Unbound AUC was 38% higher in patients \nwith severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal \nfunction. Pre- and post-dialyzer concentrations of ixazomib measured during the haemodialysis \nsession were similar, suggesting that ixazomib is not dialyzable (see section 4.2).  \n \nAge, gender, race \n \nThere was no clinically meaningful effect of age (23-91 years), sex, body surface area (1.2-2.7 m2), or \nrace on the clearance of ixazomib based on the results of a population PK analysis. The mean AUC \nwas 35% higher in Asian patients; however, there was overlap in the AUC of ixazomib across White \nand Asian patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMutagenicity \n \nIxazomib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or clastogenic in a \nbone marrow micronucleus assay in mice. Ixazomib was positive in an in vitro clastogenicity test in \nhuman peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, ixazomib was negative in an in vivo comet assay in \nmice, in which percent tail DNA was assessed in the stomach and liver. Therefore, the weight of \nevidence indicates that ixazomib is not considered to present a genotoxic risk.  \n \nReproductive and embryo-foetal development \n \nIxazomib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits only at maternally toxic doses and \nat exposures that were slightly higher than those observed in patients receiving the recommended \ndose. Studies of fertility and early embryonic development and pre- and post-natal toxicology were not \nconducted with ixazomib, but evaluation of reproductive tissues was conducted in the general toxicity \nstudies. There were no effects due to ixazomib treatment on male or female reproductive organs in \nstudies up to 6-months duration in rats and up to 9-months duration in dogs.  \n \nAnimal toxicology and/or pharmacology \n \nIn multi-cycle repeated-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs, the principal target organs \nincluded the gastrointestinal tract, lymphoid tissues, and the nervous system. In the 9-month study \n(10 cycles) in dogs orally administered with a dosing schedule mimicking the clinical regimen \n(28-day cycle), microscopic neuronal effects were generally minimal in nature and only observed at \n0.2 mg/kg (4 mg/m2). The majority of target organ findings demonstrated partial to full recovery \nfollowing discontinuation of treatment, with the exception of neuronal findings in the lumbar dorsal \nroot ganglion and dorsal column.  \n \nFollowing oral administration, a tissue distribution study in rats revealed that the brain and spinal cord \nwere amongst the tissues with the lowest levels, suggesting that the penetration of ixazomib through \nthe blood-brain barrier appears to be limited. However, the relevance to humans is unknown. \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies both in vitro (on hERG channels) and in vivo (in telemetered \ndogs following single oral administration) demonstrated no effects of ixazomib on cardiovascular or \nrespiratory functions at AUC more than 8-fold higher than the clinical value. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What NINLARO is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take NINLARO \n3. How to take NINLARO \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NINLARO \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NINLARO is and what it is used for \n \nWhat NINLARO is \nNINLARO is a cancer medicine that contains ixazomib, a ‘proteasome inhibitor’. \n \nNINLARO is used to treat a cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma. Its active substance \nixazomib works by blocking the action of proteasomes. These are structures inside the cell that digest \nproteins and are important for cell survival. Because myeloma cells produce a lot of proteins, blocking \nthe action of proteasomes can kill the cancerous cells. \n \nWhat NINLARO is used for \nNINLARO is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma. NINLARO will be given to you together \nwith lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which are other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. \n \nWhat multiple myeloma is  \nMultiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood which affects a type of cell, called the plasma cell. A \nplasma cell is a blood cell that normally produces proteins to fight infections. People with multiple \nmyeloma have cancerous plasma cells, also called myeloma cells, which can damage the bones. \nProtein produced by myeloma cells can damage the kidneys. Treatment for multiple myeloma involves \nkilling myeloma cells and reducing the symptoms of the disease.  \n \n \n\njavascript:void(0);\n\n\n49 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take NINLARO \n \nDo not take NINLARO \n- if you are allergic to ixazomib or to any of the other any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \nIf you are uncertain whether the condition above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse before taking NINLARO. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking NINLARO if: \n• you have a history of bleeding \n• you have persistent nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea \n• you have a history of nerve problems, to include tingling and numbness \n• you have a history of swelling \n• you have a persistent rash \n• you have or have had liver or kidney problems as your dose may have to be adjusted \n• you have or have had damage to the smallest blood vessels known as thrombotic \n\nmicroangiopathy or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Tell your doctor if you develop \nfatigue, fever, bruising, bleeding, decreased urination, swelling, confusion, vision loss, and \nseizures. \n\n \nYour doctor will examine you and you will be monitored closely during treatment. Before starting \nNINLARO and during treatment, you will have blood tests to check that you have enough blood cells. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNINLARO is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and NINLARO \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes any medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins or herbal \nremedies. This is because other medicines can affect the way NINLARO works. In particular, tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). These medicines should be \navoided as they may reduce the effectiveness of NINLARO. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nNINLARO is not recommended during pregnancy as it may harm your unborn baby. Breast-feeding \nshould be stopped when taking NINLARO. \n \nAvoid becoming pregnant or breast-feeding while being treated with NINLARO.
