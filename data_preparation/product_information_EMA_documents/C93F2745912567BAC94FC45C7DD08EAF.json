This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXofigo 1100 kBq/mL solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution contains 1100 kBq radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium-223 dichloride), corresponding to \n0.58 ng radium-223 at the reference date. Radium is present in the solution as a free ion. \n \nEach vial contains 6 mL of solution (6.6 MBq radium-223 dichloride at the reference date). \n \nRadium-223 is an alpha particle-emitter with a half-life of 11.4 days. The specific activity of radium-223 is \n1.9 MBq/ng. \n \nThe six-stage-decay of radium-223 to lead-207 occurs via short-lived daughters, and is accompanied by a \nnumber of alpha, beta and gamma emissions with different energies and emission probabilities. The fraction \nof energy emitted from radium-223 and its daughters as alpha-particles is 95.3% (energy range of \n5.0 - 7.5 MeV). The fraction emitted as beta-particles is 3.6% (average energies are 0.445 MeV and \n0.492 MeV), and the fraction emitted as gamma-radiation is 1.1% (energy range of 0.01 - 1.27 MeV). \n \nFigure 1: Radium-223 decay chain with physical half-lives and mode of decay: \n \n\n \n \nExcipients with known effect \nEach mL of solution contains 0.194 mmol (equivalent to 4.5 mg) of sodium.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless isotonic solution with pH between 6.0 and 8.0.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXofigo monotherapy or in combination with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue is \nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), \nsymptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastases, in progression after at least two prior lines \nof systemic therapy for mCRPC (other than LHRH analogues), or ineligible for any available systemic \nmCRPC treatment (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nXofigo should be administered only by persons authorised to handle radiopharmaceuticals in designated \nclinical settings (see section 6.6) and after evaluation of the patient by a qualified physician. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose regimen of Xofigo is an activity of 55 kBq per kg body weight, given at 4 week intervals for \n6 injections.  \n \nSafety and efficacy beyond 6 injections with Xofigo have not been studied. \n \nFor details on the calculation of the volume to be administered see section 12. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) and younger \npatients (aged < 65 years) in the phase III study. \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in elderly patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSafety and efficacy of Xofigo have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \nSince radium-223 is neither metabolised by the liver nor eliminated via the bile, hepatic impairment is not \nexpected to affect the pharmacokinetics of radium-223 dichloride.  \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn the phase III clinical study, no relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients \nwith mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCR]: 50 to 80 mL/min) and normal renal function. \nLimited data are available for patients with moderate (CLCR: 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment. No data \nare available for patients with severe (CLCR < 30 mL/min) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. \nHowever, since excretion in urine is minimal and the major route of elimination is via the faeces, renal \nimpairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of radium-223 dichloride. \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Xofigo in the paediatric population in the indication of prostate cancer. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nXofigo is for intravenous use. It must be administered by slow injection (generally up to 1 minute). \n \nThe intravenous access line or cannula must be flushed with isotonic sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection before and after injection of Xofigo. \n \nFor additional instructions on the use of the medicinal product, see sections 6.6 and 12. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nXofigo is contraindicated in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCombination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone or with systemic cancer therapies other than \nLHRH analogues \n \nAn interim analysis from a clinical trial in chemotherapy-naïve patients with asymptomatic or mildly \nsymptomatic castration resistant prostate cancer and progressive disease with bone metastases showed an \nincreased risk of fractures and a trend for increased mortality among patients receiving Xofigo in \ncombination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients receiving placebo in \ncombination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone (see section 5.1).  \nTherefore, Xofigo is contraindicated in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone \n(see section 4.3).  \n \nSafety and efficacy of Xofigo in combination with cancer therapies other than LHRH analogues have not \nbeen established; an increased risk of mortality and fractures is possible. The combination of radium-223 \nwith other systemic cancer therapies other than LHRH analogues is therefore not recommended. \n \nData on a safe period after which Xofigo can be administered following treatment with abiraterone acetate in \ncombination with prednisone/prednisolone and vice versa is limited. Based on the elimination half-life of \nXofigo and abiraterone, it is recommended that subsequent treatment with Xofigo is not initiated for at least \n5 days after the last administration of abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone/prednisolone. \nSubsequent systemic cancer treatment should not be initiated for at least 30 days after the last administration \nof Xofigo. \n \nTreatment of patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic bone metastases \n \nAn increased risk of death and fractures was observed in a clinical study, where Xofigo was added to \nabiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic \ncastration resistant prostate cancer. \n \nTreatment benefit of Xofigo in adults with castration-resistant prostate cancer and only asymptomatic bone \nmetastases is not established. The use of Xofigo is therefore not recommended for treatment of adults with \ncastration-resistant prostate cancer and only asymptomatic bone metastases. In adults with castration-\nresistant prostate cancer and mildly symptomatic bone metastases the benefit of treatment should be \ncarefully assessed to outweigh the risks considering that high osteoblastic activity is likely to be required for \ntreatment benefit (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nPatients with a low level of osteoblastic bone metastases \n \nIn clinical studies, patients with fewer than 6 bone metastases had an increased risk of fractures and did not \nhave a statistically significant survival benefit. A pre-specified subgroup analysis also showed that overall \nsurvival was not significantly improved in patients with a total ALP < 220 U/L. Therefore in patients with a \nlow level of osteoblastic bone metastases radium-223 is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n \nBone marrow suppression \n \nBone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia and pancytopenia, has been \nreported in patients treated with Xofigo (see section 4.8).  \n \nTherefore, haematological evaluation of patients must be performed at baseline and prior to every dose of \nXofigo. Before the first administration, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, the \nplatelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l and haemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dl. Before subsequent administrations, the ANC \nshould be ≥ 1.0 x 109/l and the platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/l. In case there is no recovery in these values within \n6 weeks after the last administration of Xofigo despite receiving standard of care, further treatment with \nXofigo should only be continued after a careful benefit/risk evaluation. \n \nPatients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve e.g. following prior cytotoxic chemotherapy \nand/or radiation treatment (EBRT) or prostate cancer patients with advanced diffuse infiltration of the bone \n(EOD4; “superscan”) should be treated with caution. An increased incidence of haematological adverse \nreactions such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in these patients during the phase III \nstudy (see section 4.8). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of cytotoxic chemotherapy performed after treatment with Xofigo has not been \nestablished. The limited available data indicates that patients receiving chemotherapy after Xofigo had a \nsimilar haematological profile compared to patients receiving chemotherapy after placebo (see also \nsection 5.1).  \n \nCrohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis \n \nSafety and efficacy of Xofigo in patients with Crohn’s disease and with ulcerative colitis have not been \nstudied. Due to the faecal excretion of Xofigo, radiation may lead to aggravation of acute inflammatory \nbowel disease. Xofigo should only be administered after a careful benefit-risk assessment in patients with \nacute inflammatory bowel disease. \n \nSpinal cord compression \n \nIn patients with untreated imminent or established spinal cord compression, treatment with standard of care, \nas clinically indicated, should be completed before starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo. \n \nBone fractures \n \nXofigo increases the risk of bone fractures. In a clinical study, the addition of Xofigo to abiraterone acetate \nand prednisone/prednisolone, increased the incidence of fractures approximately three-fold in the Xofigo arm \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Increased fracture risk has been found especially in patients with medical history \nof osteoporosis and in patients with less than 6 bone metastases. Xofigo is believed to accumulate at sites of \nhigh bone turnover such as sites of degenerative bone disease (osteoporosis) or recent (micro-)fracture \nincreasing the risk of fractures. Other factors such as concomitant use of steroids may further increase the \nrisk of fracture. \n \nPrior to starting radium-223 bone status (e.g. by scintigraphy, bone mineral density measurement) and \nbaseline risk of fractures of patients (e.g. osteoporosis, less than 6 bone metastases, medication increasing \nfracture risk, low body mass index) should be carefully assessed, and closely monitored for at least \n24 months. Preventive measures such as the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab should be considered \nbefore starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo (see section 4.8). In patients with a high baseline risk of \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nfracture, the benefit of treatment should be carefully assessed to outweigh the risk. In patients with bone \nfractures, orthopaedic stabilisation of fractures should be performed before starting or resuming treatment \nwith Xofigo. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n \nIn patients treated with bisphosphonates and Xofigo, an increased risk of development of osteonecrosis of \nthe jaw (ONJ) cannot be excluded. In the phase III study, cases of ONJ have been reported in 0.67% patients \n(4/600) in the Xofigo arm compared to 0.33% patients (1/301) in the placebo arm. However, all patients with \nONJ were also exposed to prior or concomitant bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) and prior \nchemotherapy (e.g. docetaxel). \n \nSecondary malignant neoplasms \n \nXofigo contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Therefore, long-term \ncumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer and hereditary defects. In \nparticular, the risk for osteosarcoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and leukaemias may be increased. No cases \nof Xofigo-induced cancer have been reported in clinical trials in follow-up of up to three years. \n \nGastrointestinal toxicity \n \nXofigo increases the incidence of diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting (see section 4.8) which may result in \ndehydration. Oral intake and fluid status of patients should be carefully monitored. Patients should be \nadvised to seek medical advice if they experience severe or persistent diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting.  \nPatients who display signs or symptoms of dehydration or hypovolemia should be promptly treated. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nDepending on the volume administered, this medicinal product can contain up to 2.35 mmol (54 mg) sodium \nper dose, equivalent to 2.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinical interaction studies have been performed. \n \nAs interactions with calcium and phosphate cannot be excluded, pausing supplementation with these \nsubstances and/or Vitamin D should be considered some days before starting with Xofigo treatment. \n \nConcomitant chemotherapy with Xofigo may have additive effects on bone marrow suppression (see \nsection 4.4). Safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with Xofigo have not been established. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Xofigo. \nBecause of potential effects on spermatogenesis associated with radiation, men should be advised to use \neffective contraceptive methods during and up to 6 months after treatment with Xofigo. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nXofigo is not indicated in women. Xofigo is not to be used in women who are, or may be, pregnant or \nbreast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nFertility \n \nThere are no human data on the effect of Xofigo on fertility. \nBased on studies in animals, there is a potential risk that radiation from Xofigo could cause adverse effects \non fertility (see section 5.3). Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXofigo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe overall safety profile of Xofigo is based on data from 600 patients treated with Xofigo in the \nphase III study.  \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (≥ 10%) in patients receiving Xofigo were diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia and bone fracture.  \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (see section 4.4 and \n‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions observed with Xofigo are represented in the table below (see Table 1). They are \nclassified according to System Organ Class. The most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a \ncertain reaction and its synonyms and related conditions. \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials are classified according to their frequencies. Frequencies are defined \nas: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials in patients treated with Xofigo \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \n(MedDRA) \n\nVery  \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders  Thrombocytopenia \n\nNeutropenia  \nPancytopenia \nLeukopenia \n\nLymphopenia \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders  \n\nBone fracture  Osteoporosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Injection site reactions  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nBone fractures \nXofigo increases the risk of bone fractures (see section 5.1). In clinical studies, concurrent use of \nbisphosphonates or denosumab reduced the incidence of fractures in patients treated with radium-223 \nmonotherapy. Fractures have occurred for up to 24 months after the first dose of radium-223. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nThrombocytopenia and neutropenia \nThrombocytopenia (all grades) occurred in 11.5% of patients treated with Xofigo and 5.6% of patients \nreceiving placebo. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 6.3% of patients treated with Xofigo \nand in 2% of patients receiving placebo (see section 4.4). Overall, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 \nthrombocytopenia was lower in patients that did not previously receive docetaxel (2.8% in patients treated \nwith Xofigo versus 0.8% in patients receiving placebo) compared to patients that previously received \ndocetaxel (8.9% in patients treated with Xofigo versus 2.9% in patients receiving placebo). In EOD4 \n(“superscan”) patients, thrombocytopenia (all grades) was reported in 19.6% of patients treated with Xofigo \nand in 6.7% of patients receiving placebo. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 5.9% of patients \ntreated with Xofigo and in 6.7% of patients receiving placebo (see section 4.4). \n \nNeutropenia (all grades) was reported in 5% of patients treated with Xofigo and in 1% of patients receiving \nplacebo. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 2.2% of patients treated with Xofigo and in 0.7% of \npatients receiving placebo. Overall, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was lower in patients that did \nnot previously receive docetaxel (0.8% in patients treated with Xofigo versus 0.8% in patients receiving \nplacebo) compared to patients that previously received docetaxel (3.2% in patients treated with Xofigo \nversus 0.6% in patients receiving placebo). \n \nIn a phase I study, neutrophil and platelet count nadirs occurred at 2 to 3 weeks after intravenous \nadministration of a single dose of Xofigo. \n \nInjection site reactions \nGrade 1 and 2 injection site reactions, such as erythema, pain and swelling, were reported in 1.2% of patients \ntreated with Xofigo and in 0% of patients receiving placebo. \n \nSecondary malignant neoplasms \nXofigo contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative \nradiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer and hereditary defects. In particular, \nthe risk for osteosarcoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and leukaemias may be increased. \nNo cases of Xofigo-induced cancer have been reported in clinical trials in follow-up of up to three years. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere have been no reports of inadvertent overdosing of Xofigo during clinical studies. \n \nThere is no specific antidote. In the event of an inadvertent overdose, general supportive measures, including \nmonitoring for potential haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity should be undertaken. \n \nSingle Xofigo doses containing an activity of up to 276 kBq per kg body weight were evaluated in a phase I \nclinical trial and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, \nvarious therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10XX03 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nMechanism of action  \n \nXofigo is a therapeutic alpha particle-emitting pharmaceutical. \n \nIts active moiety radium-223 (as radium-223 dichloride) mimics calcium and selectively targets bone, \nspecifically areas of bone metastases, by forming complexes with the bone mineral hydroxyapatite. The high \nlinear energy transfer of alpha emitters (80 keV/µm) leads to a high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks \nin adjacent tumour cells, resulting in a potent cytotoxic effect. Additional effects on the tumour \nmicroenvironment including osteoblasts and osteoclasts also contribute to the in vivo efficacy. The alpha \nparticle range from radium-223 is less than 100 µm (less than 10 cell diameters) which minimises damage to \nthe surrounding normal tissue.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nCompared with placebo, there was a significant difference in favour of Xofigo for all five serum biomarkers \nfor bone turnover studied in a phase II randomised study (bone formation markers: bone alkaline \nphosphatase [ALP], total ALP and procollagen I N propeptide [PINP], bone resorption markers: C-terminal \ncrosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen / serum C-terminal crosslinked telopeptide of type I collagen \n[S-CTX-I] and type I collagen crosslinked C-telopeptide [ICTP]). \n \nCardiac electrophysiology / QT prolongation \nNo significant QTc prolonging effects were observed after intravenous injection of Xofigo in comparison \nwith placebo in a subgroup of 29 patients in the phase III study (ALSYMPCA). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe clinical safety and efficacy of Xofigo have been evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, multiple dose, \nphase III, multicentre study (ALSYMPCA; EudraCT 2007-006195-1)) in castration-resistant prostate cancer \npatients with symptomatic bone metastases. Patients with visceral metastases and malignant \nlymphadenopathy exceeding 3 cm were excluded. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. Main secondary endpoints included time to symptomatic \nskeletal events (SSE), time to progression of total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), time to progression of \nprostate specific antigen (PSA), response of total ALP and normalisation of total ALP. \n \nAt the cut-off date of the pre-planned interim analysis (confirmatory analysis), a total of 809 patients were \nrandomised 2:1 to receive Xofigo 55 kBq/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (N=541) plus best \nstandard of care, or matching placebo plus best standard of care (N=268). Best standard of care included e.g. \nlocal external beam radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids, antiandrogens, oestrogens, estramustine \nor ketoconazole.  \n \nAn updated descriptive analysis of safety and of overall survival was performed in 921 randomised patients \nprior to implementing crossover (i.e. offering patients in the placebo group to receive Xofigo treatment). \n \nDemographic and baseline disease characteristics (interim analysis population) were similar between the \nXofigo and placebo groups and are shown below for Xofigo: \n• the mean age of patients was 70 years (range 49 to 90 years). \n• 87% of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance status score of 0-1. \n• 41% received bisphosphonates. \n• 42% of patients did not receive prior docetaxel because they were deemed ineligible or refused to \n\nreceive docetaxel.  \n• 46% of patients had no pain or WHO scale 1 (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) and 54% had \n\npain WHO scale 2-3.  \n• 16% of patients had <6 bone metastases, 44% of patients had between 6 and 20 bone metastases, \n\n40% of patients had more than 20 bone metastases or superscan. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nDuring the treatment period, 83% of patients received luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) \nagonists and 21% of patients received anti-androgens concomitantly.  \n \nThe results of both the interim and updated analysis revealed that overall survival was significantly longer in \npatients treated with Xofigo plus best standard of care compared to patients treated with placebo plus best \nstandard of care (see Table 2 and Figure 2). A higher rate of non-prostate cancer related deaths was observed \nin the placebo group (26/541, 4.8% in the Xofigo arm compared to 23/268, 8.6% in the placebo arm).  \n \nTable 2: Survival results from the phase III ALSYMPCA study \n \n\n Xofigo Placebo \nInterim analysis N = 541 N = 268 \n\nNumber (%) of deaths 191 (35.3%) 123 (45.9%) \nMedian overall survival (months) (95% CI) 14.0 (12.1 – 15.8) 11.2 (9.0 – 13.2) \nHazard ratiob (95% CI) 0.695 (0.552 – 0.875) \np-valuea (2-sided) 0.00185 \n\nUpdated analysis N = 614 N = 307 \nNumber (%) of deaths 333 (54.2%) 195 (63.5%) \nMedian overall survival (months) (95% CI) 14.9 (13.9 – 16.1) 11.3 (10.4 – 12.8) \nHazard ratiob (95% CI) 0.695 (0.581 – 0.832) \n\nCI  = confidence interval  \na The Phase 3 study ALSYMPCA was stopped for efficacy after the interim analysis.

Therefore, efficacy may be diminished in patients with a low \nlevel of osteoblastic activity from their bone metastases. \n \nQuality of life \nHealth Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) was assessed in the phase III ALSYMPCA study using specific \nquestionnaires: the EQ-5D (generic instrument) and the FACT-P (prostate cancer specific instrument). Both \ngroups experience a loss of quality of life. Relative to placebo, the decline in quality of life was slower for \nXofigo during the on-treatment period as measured by EQ-5D utility index score (-0.040 versus – 0.109; \np=0.001), EQ-5D self-reported Visual Analogue health status scores (VAS) (-2.661 versus -5.860; p=0.018) \nand the FACT P total score (-3.880 versus -7.651, p=0.006) but did not reach published minimally important \ndifferences. There is limited evidence that the delay in loss of HRQOL extends beyond the treatment period. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nPain relief \nThe results from the phase III ALSYPMCA study regarding time to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) \nfor pain relief and fewer patients reporting bone pain as an adverse event in the Xofigo group indicate a \npositive effect on bone pain. \n \nSubsequent treatment with cytotoxic substances \nIn the course of the 2:1 randomised ALSYMPCA study, 93 (15.5%) patients in the Xofigo group and \n54 (17.9%) patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy at varying times after the last \ntreatment. No differences in haematological laboratory values were apparent between the two groups. \n \nCombination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of concurrent initiation of Xofigo, abiraterone acetate and \nprednisone/prednisolone treatment was assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter phase III \nstudy (ERA-223 trial) in 806 chemotherapy-naïve patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic \ncastration resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases. The study was unblinded early based on an \nIndependent Data Monitoring Committee Recommendation. At an interim analysis, an increased incidence \nof fractures (28.6% vs 11.4%) and reduced median overall survival (30.7 months versus 33.3 months, \nHR 1.195, 95% CI [0.950 - 1.505], p=0.13) was observed among patients receiving Xofigo in combination \nwith abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients receiving placebo in combination \nwith abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Xofigo in all \nsubsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of all conditions included in the category of malignant \nneoplasms (except central nervous system tumours, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms) and in \nthe treatment of multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral introduction \n \nPharmacokinetic, biodistribution and dosimetry data have been obtained from 3 phase I studies. \nPharmacokinetic data were obtained in 25 patients at activities ranging from 51 to 276 kBq/kg. \nPharmacokinetic, biodistribution and dosimetry data were obtained in 6 patients at an activity of 110 kBq/kg \ngiven twice, 6 weeks apart, and in 10 patients at an activity of 55, 110 or 221 kBq/kg. \n \nAbsorption \n \nXofigo is administered as an intravenous injection and is thus 100% bioavailable. \n \nDistribution and organ uptake \n \nAfter intravenous injection, radium-223 is rapidly cleared from the blood and is incorporated primarily into \nbone and bone metastases, or is excreted into the intestine.  \n \nFifteen minutes post injection, about 20% of the injected activity remained in the blood. At 4 hours, about \n4% of the injected activity remained in the blood, decreasing to less than 1% at 24 hours after the injection. \nThe volume of distribution was higher than the blood volume indicating distribution to peripheral \ncompartments. \n \nAt 10 minutes post injection, activity was observed in the bone and in the intestine. At 4 hours post injection, \nthe mean percentage of the radioactive dose present in bone and intestine was approximately 61% and 49%, \nrespectively.  \n \nNo significant uptake was seen in other organs such as heart, liver, kidneys, urinary bladder and spleen at \n4 hours post injection. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \nBiotransformation \n \nRadium-223 is an isotope which decays and is not metabolised. \n \nElimination \n \nFaecal excretion is the major route of elimination from the body. About 5% is excreted in the urine and there \nis no evidence of hepatobiliary excretion. \n \nThe whole body measurements at 7 days after injection (after correcting for decay) indicate that a median of \n76% of administered activity was excreted from the body. The rate of elimination of radium-223 dichloride \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract is influenced by the high variability in intestinal transit rates across the \npopulation, with the normal range from once daily to once weekly bowel evacuation. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of radium-223 dichloride were linear in the activity range investigated (51 to \n276 kBq/kg).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and effectiveness of Xofigo have not been studied in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic toxicity \n \nIn single and repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the main findings were reduced body weight gain, \nhaematological changes, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase and microscopic findings in the bone marrow \n(depletion of haematopoietic cells, fibrosis), spleen (secondary extra-medullary haematopoiesis) and bone \n(depletion of osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro-osseous lesions, disruption/disorganisation of the \nphysis/growth line). These findings were related to radiation-induced impairment of haematopoiesis and a \nreduction of osteogenesis and started at the lowest activity of 22 kBq per kg body weight (0.4 times the \nclinically recommended dose). \n\nIn dogs, haematological changes were observed starting at the lowest activity of 55 kBq/kg, the clinically \nrecommended dose. Dose-limiting myelotoxicity was seen in dogs after single administration of 497 kBq \nradium-223 dichloride per kg body weight (9 times the clinically recommended activity). \nAfter repeated administration of the clinically recommended activity of 55 kBq per kg body weight once \nevery 4 weeks for 6 months, two dogs developed non-displaced pelvic fractures. Due to the presence of \nosteolysis of trabecular bone in other bone locations of treated animals in varying degree, a spontaneous \nfracture in the context of osteolysis cannot be excluded. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nRetinal detachment was seen in dogs after a single injection of activities of 166 and 497 kBq per kg body \nweight (3 and 9 times the clinically recommended dose), but not after repeated administration of the \nclinically recommended activity of 55 kBq per kg body weight once every 4 weeks for 6 months. The exact \nmechanism for induction of retinal detachment is unknown, but literature data suggests that radium is \nspecifically taken up in the tapetum lucidum of the canine eye. Since humans do not have a tapetum lucidum, \nthe clinical relevance of these findings for humans is uncertain. No case of retinal detachment has been \nreported in clinical trials. \n \nNo histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of radium-223 dichloride. \n \nOsteosarcomas, a known effect of bone-seeking radionuclides, were observed at clinically relevant doses in \nrats 7 – 12 months after start of treatment. Osteosarcomas were not observed in dog studies. No case of \nosteosarcoma has been reported in clinical studies with Xofigo. The risk for patients to develop \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nosteosarcomas with exposure to radium-223 is unknown at present. The presence of neoplastic changes, \nother than osteosarcomas, was also reported in the longer term (12 to 15 months) rat toxicity studies (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nEmbryotoxicity / Reproduction toxicity \n \nStudies on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed. In general, radionuclides \ninduce reproductive and developmental effects. \n \nA minimal number of abnormal spermatocytes were seen in a few seminiferous tubules in the testes of male \nrats after a single administration of ≥ 2270 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 dichloride (≥ 41 times the \nclinically recommended activity). The testes seemed to otherwise be functioning normally and the \nepididymides revealed a normal content of spermatocytes. Uterine polyps (endometrial stroma) were \nobserved in female rats after single or repeated administration of ≥ 359 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 \ndichloride (≥ 6.5 times the clinically recommended activity). \n \nSince radium-223 distributes mainly to bone, the potential risk for adverse effects in the male gonads in \ncancer patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer is very low, but cannot be excluded (see section 4.6). \n \nGenotoxicity / Carcinogenicity  \n \nStudies on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Xofigo have not been performed. In general, \nradionuclides are considered to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. \n \nSafety pharmacology \n \nNo significant effects were seen on vital organ systems, i.e. cardiovascular (dog), respiratory or central \nnervous systems (rat), after single dose administration of activities from 497 to 1100 kBq per kg body weight \n(9 [dog] to 20 [rat] times the clinically recommended activity). \n \n \n6.

Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or \nappropriate licenses of the competent official organisation. \n \nXofigo should be handled in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality \nrequirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n \nRadiation protection \n \nThe gamma radiation associated with the decay of radium-223 and its daughters allows for the radioactivity \nmeasurement of Xofigo and the detection of contaminations with standard instruments. \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spill of urine, faeces, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with \nnational regulations must therefore be taken. Care should be used when handling materials, such as bed \nlinen, that come into contact with such body fluids. Although radium-223 is predominantly an alpha emitter, \ngamma and beta radiation is associated with the decay of radium-223 and its radioactive daughter isotopes. \nThe external radiation exposure associated with handling of patient doses is considerably lower in \ncomparison to other radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic purposes as the administered radioactivity will \nusually be below 8 MBq. However, in keeping with the ALARA (“As Low As Reasonably Achievable”) \nprinciple, for minimisation of radiation exposure, it is recommended to minimise the time spent in radiation \nareas, to maximise the distance to radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. \n \nAny unused product or waste materials should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. \nAny materials used in connection with the preparation or administration of Xofigo are to be treated as \nradioactive waste. \n \n \n7.

For radium-223, as primarily an alpha emitter, \nadditional assumptions were made for the intestine, red marrow and bone/osteogenic cells, to provide the \nbest possible absorbed dose calculations for Xofigo, considering its observed biodistribution and specific \ncharacteristics (see Table 4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nTable 4: Calculated absorbed radiation doses to organs \n \n\nTarget Organ Alpha1 \nemission \n\n(Gy/MBq) \n\nBeta \nemission \n\n(Gy/MBq) \n\nGamma \nemission \n\n(Gy/MBq) \n\nTotal dose \n \n\n(Gy/MBq) \n\nCoefficient \nof variation \n\n(%) \nAdrenals 0.00000 0.00002 0.00009 0.00012 56 \nBrain 0.00000 0.00002 0.00008 0.00010 80 \nBreasts 0.00000 0.00002 0.00003 0.00005 120 \nGallbladder wall 0.00000 0.00002 0.00021 0.00023 14 \nLLI2 Wall 0.00000 0.04561 0.00085 0.04645 83 \nSmall intestine wall 0.00319 0.00360 0.00047 0.00726 45 \nStomach wall 0.00000 0.00002 0.00011 0.00014 22 \nULI3 wall 0.00000 0.03149 0.00082 0.03232 50 \nHeart wall 0.00161 0.00007 0.00005 0.00173 42 \nKidneys 0.00299 0.00011 0.00011 0.00321 36 \nLiver 0.00279 0.00010 0.00008 0.00298 36 \nLungs 0.00109 0.00007 0.00005 0.00121 --4 \nMuscle 0.00000 0.00002 0.00010 0.00012 41 \nOvaries 0.00000 0.00002 0.00046 0.00049 40 \nPancreas 0.00000 0.00002 0.00009 0.00011 43 \nRed marrow 0.13217 0.00642 0.00020 0.13879 41 \nOsteogenic cells 1.13689 0.01487 0.00030 1.15206 41 \nSkin 0.00000 0.00002 0.00005 0.00007 79 \nSpleen 0.00000 0.00002 0.00007 0.00009 54 \nTestes 0.00000 0.00002 0.00006 0.00008 59 \nThymus 0.00000 0.00002 0.00003 0.00006 109 \nThyroid 0.00000 0.00002 0.00005 0.00007 96 \nUrinary bladder wall 0.00371 0.00016 0.00016 0.00403 63 \nUterus 0.00000 0.00002 0.00023 0.00026 28 \nWhole body 0.02220 0.00081 0.00012 0.02312 16 \n\n1As there was no uptake of radium-223 in most of the soft tissues observed, the alpha contribution to the total organ \ndose was set to zero for these organs. \n2LLI: lower large intestine \n3ULI: upper large intestine \n4Absorbed dose data to the lung are based on model-derived calculation using pooled blood time-activity data from all \nsubjects \n \nThe haematological adverse reactions observed in the clinical studies with Xofigo are much lower in \nfrequency and severity than what could be expected from the calculated absorbed doses to the red marrow. \nThis may be related to spatial distribution of alpha particle radiation resulting in non-uniform radiation dose \nto the red marrow. \n \n \n12. INSTRUCTION FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nThis medicinal product should be visually inspected before use. Xofigo is a clear, colourless solution and \nshould not be used in case of discolouration, the occurrence of particulate matter or a defective container. \n \nXofigo is a ready-to-use solution and should not be diluted or mixed with any other solutions. \n \nEach vial is for single use only. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nThe volume to be administered to a given patient should be calculated using the: \n- Patient’s body weight (kg)  \n- Dosage level (55 kBq/kg body weight) \n- Radioactivity concentration of the product (1100 kBq/mL) at reference date. The reference date is \n\nstated on the vial and lead pot label. \n- Decay correction (DK) factor to correct for physical decay of radium-223.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nXofigo 1100 kBq/mL solution for injection \nradium Ra 223 dichloride \n\n \n \n\n This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor who will supervise the procedure.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. See section 4.  \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Xofigo is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before Xofigo is used \n3. How Xofigo is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How Xofigo is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xofigo is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine contains the active substance radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium-223 dichloride). \n \nXofigo is used to treat adults with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer in progression after at least \ntwo other cancer treatments apart from treatments to maintain reduced levels of male hormone (hormone \ntherapy), or who cannot take any other cancer treatment. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a cancer of \nthe prostate (a gland of the male reproductive system) that does not respond to treatment that reduces male \nhormones. Xofigo is only used when the disease has spread to the bone but is not known to have spread to \nother internal organs, and is causing symptoms (e.g. pain). \n \nXofigo contains the radioactive substance radium-223 which mimics the calcium found in bones. When \ninjected into the patient, radium-223 reaches the bone where the cancer has spread to and emits short-range \nradiation (alpha particles) which kills the surrounding tumour cells. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before Xofigo is used \n \nXofigo must not be given \n in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone (which are used together to treat prostate \n\ncancer). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Xofigo \n- Xofigo must not be given in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone due to a possible \n\nincrease in the risk of bone fracture or death. Additionally, there are uncertainties about the effects of \nXofigo in combination with other medicines used to treat metastatic prostate cancer. If you are already \ntaking one of those medicines, please tell your doctor.  \n\n- If you plan to take Xofigo following treatment with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone, you must \nwait 5 days before starting treatment with Xofigo. \n\n- If you plan to take other cancer therapy following treatment with Xofigo, you must wait at least 30 days \nbefore starting treatment. \n\n- Xofigo is not recommended if cancer in your bones is not causing symptoms, such as pain.  \n- Xofigo can lead to a decrease in the number of your blood cells and blood platelets. Before starting \n\ntreatment and before each subsequent dose your doctor will perform blood tests. Depending on the \nresults of these tests your doctor will decide if treatment can be started, can be continued, or needs to be \npostponed or discontinued.  \n\n- If you suffer from decreased blood cell production in the bone marrow, e.g. if you have received \nprior chemotherapy (other medicines used to kill cancer cells) and/or radiation therapy, you may be at \nhigher risk and your doctor will give you Xofigo with caution. \n\n- If your tumour has spread to the bone extensively, you may also be more likely to have decreases in your \nblood cells and platelets, so your doctor will give you Xofigo with caution. \n\n- The limited data available do not suggest any major differences in the blood cell production of patients \nreceiving chemotherapy after treatment with Xofigo compared with those who did not receive Xofigo. \n\n- There are no data on the use of Xofigo in patients with Crohn’s disease (a long-term inflammatory \ndisease of the intestines) and with ulcerative colitis (a long-term inflammation of the colon). As Xofigo \nis excreted in the faeces, it may make acute inflammation of your bowels worse. Therefore, if you suffer \nfrom these conditions your doctor will carefully consider if you can be treated with Xofigo. \n\n- If you suffer from untreated spinal cord compression or if it is thought likely that you are developing \nspinal cord compression (pressure on the spinal cord nerves which can be caused by a tumour or other \nlesion), your doctor will first treat this disease with standard treatment before starting or continuing \ntreatment with Xofigo. \n\n- If you have osteoporosis or a known increased risk for fractures (e.g. recent bone fracture, fragility), \nor take or have been taking steroids (e.g. prednisone/prednisolone), please tell your doctor. You might \nbe at a higher risk of bone fractures. Your doctor might prescribe you a drug to prevent bone fractures \nbefore starting or continuing treatment with Xofigo. \n\n- If you experience any new or unusual pain or swelling in bone region prior, during or after your \ntreatment with Xofigo, you should consult your doctor. \n\n- If you experience a bone fracture, your doctor will first stabilise the fractured bone before starting or \ncontinuing treatment with Xofigo. \n\n- If you take or have taken bisphosphonates or have received chemotherapy prior to treatment with \nXofigo, please tell your doctor. A risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (dead tissue in the jaw bone which is \nmainly seen in patients who have been treated with bisphosphonates) cannot be excluded (see section 4). \n\n- Xofigo contributes to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative \nradiation exposure may increase your risk for developing cancer (in particular of bone cancer and \nleukaemia) and hereditary abnormalities. No cases of cancer caused by Xofigo have been reported in \nclinical trials with a follow-up of up to three years. \n\n \nYour doctor will test your bone health before deciding whether you can be given Xofigo. During treatment \nand for 2 years after starting treatment with Xofigo, your doctor will continuously monitor your bone health. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xofigo \nNo interaction studies with other medicines have been done. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nXofigo must not be given in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone due to a possible \nincrease in the risk of bone fracture or death. Additionally, there are uncertainties about the effects of Xofigo \nin combination with other systemic medicines used to treat metastatic prostate cancer. If you are already \ntaking one of those medicines, please tell your doctor. \n \nIf you take or have taken bisphosphonates or other medicines to protect your bone health or steroids (e.g. \nprednisone/prednisolone) prior to treatment with Xofigo, please tell your doctor. You might be at a higher \nrisk for bone fractures. \n \nIf you are taking calcium, phosphate and/or Vitamin D, your doctor will carefully consider if you need to \ntemporarily stop taking these substances before you start treatment with Xofigo. \n \nThere are no data on the use of Xofigo at the same time as chemotherapy (other medicines used to kill \ncancer cells). Xofigo and chemotherapy used together may further decrease the number of your blood cells \nand blood platelets. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nXofigo is not for use in women and must not be given to women who are, or may be, pregnant or who are \nbreast-feeding. \n \nContraception in males and females \nIf you are engaged in sexual activity with a woman who could become pregnant you are advised to use \neffective birth control methods during and up to 6 months after treatment with Xofigo. \n \nFertility \nThere is a potential risk that radiation from Xofigo could affect your fertility. Please ask your doctor how this \nmay affect you, especially if you are planning to have children in the future. You may wish to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm before treatment starts. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is considered unlikely that Xofigo will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nXofigo contains sodium \nDepending on the volume administered, this medicine can contain up to 54 mg sodium (main component of \ncooking/table salt) per dose. This is equivalent to 2.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake \nof sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How Xofigo is used \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of medicines like Xofigo. It will only be used in \nspecial controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and \nqualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe use of this product and will keep \nyou informed of their actions. \n \nThe dose you receive depends on your body weight. The doctor supervising the procedure will calculate the \nquantity of Xofigo to be used in your case. \nThe recommended dose of Xofigo is 55 kBq (Becquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity) per kilogram \nbody weight. \nNo dose adjustment is necessary if you are 65 years of age or older or if you have reduced kidney or liver \nfunction. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nAdministration of Xofigo and conduct of the procedure \nXofigo will be injected slowly via a needle into one of your veins (intravenously). The healthcare \nprofessional will flush the intravenous access line or cannula before and after injection with a saline solution. \n \nDuration of the procedure \n- Xofigo is given once every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. \n- There are no data available on the safety and efficacy of treatment with more than 6 injections of \n\nXofigo. \n \nAfter administration of Xofigo \n- Care should be taken when handling materials, such as bed linen, that come into contact with body \n\nfluids (such as spill of urine, faeces, vomiting etc.). Xofigo is excreted mainly via the faeces. The doctor \nwill tell you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving this medicine. Contact your \ndoctor if you have any questions. \n\n \nIf you have been given more Xofigo than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely. \nHowever, in the case of an accidental overdose, your doctor will start appropriate supportive treatment and \nwill check you for changes in the number of blood cells, and for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, \nnausea [feeling sick], vomiting). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of Xofigo, please ask the doctor who supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most serious side effects in patients receiving Xofigo are \n- decrease in the number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), \n- decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells (neutropenia, which may lead to \n\nan increased risk of infection). \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you notice the following symptoms as they may be signs of \nthrombocytopenia or neutropenia (see above): \n- any unusual bruising, \n- more bleeding than usual after injury, \n- fever, \n- or if you seem to be catching a lot of infections. \n \nYour doctor will perform blood tests before starting treatment and before each injection to check your \nnumber of blood cells and platelets (see also section 2). \n \n \nThe most frequent side effects in patients receiving Xofigo (very common [may affect more than \n1 in 10 people]) are: \n- diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, thrombocytopenia (decrease in the number of blood \n\nplatelets) and bone fracture. \n \nRisk of dehydration: tell your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: dizziness, increased thirst, \ndecreased urination or dry skin as these can all be symptoms of dehydration. It is important to avoid \ndehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nOther possible side effects are listed below by how likely they are: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- decrease in the number of white blood cells (leukopenia) \n- decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells (neutropenia, which may lead to an \n\nincreased risk of infection) \n- decrease in the number of red and white blood cells and blood platelets (pancytopenia) \n- injection site reactions (e.g. redness of the skin [erythema], pain and swelling) \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n- decrease in the number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells (lymphopenia) \n- weakened bones (osteoporosis) \n \nXofigo contributes to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation \nexposure may increase your risk of developing cancer (in particular of bone cancer and leukaemia) and \nhereditary abnormalities. No cases of cancer caused by Xofigo have been reported in clinical trials with a \nfollow-up of up to three years. \n \nIf you have symptoms of pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a “heavy jaw feeling” or loosening of a \ntooth, please contact your doctor. Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (dead tissue in the jaw bone which is \nmainly seen in patients who have been treated with bisphosphonates) have occurred in patients treated with \nXofigo. All these cases were only seen in patients receiving bisphosphonates prior to or at the same time of \ntreatment with Xofigo and chemotherapy prior to treatment with Xofigo. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. \nYou can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting \nside effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How Xofigo is stored \n \nYou will not have to store this medicine. This medicine is stored under the responsibility of the specialist in \nappropriate premises. Storage of radiopharmaceuticals will be in accordance with national regulations on \nradioactive materials. \n \nThe following information is intended for the specialist only: \nXofigo must not be used after the expiry date which is stated on the vial and the lead pot. \nThis medicine does not require any special temperature storage conditions. \nXofigo must not be used if discolouration, the occurrence of particulate matter or a defective container is \nnoticed. \n \n \n6.
