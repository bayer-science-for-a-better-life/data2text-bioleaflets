NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nQtern 5 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains saxagliptin hydrochloride equivalent to 5 mg saxagliptin and dapagliflozin \npropanediol monohydrate equivalent to 10 mg dapagliflozin.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach tablet contains 40 mg of lactose (as anhydrous).\n\nQtern contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nLight brown to brown, biconvex, 0.8 cm round, film-coated tablet, with “5/10” printed on one side, \nand “1122” printed on the other side, in blue ink.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nQtern, fixed dose combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, is indicated in adults aged 18 years and \n\nolder with type 2 diabetes mellitus:\n- to improve glycaemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the \n\nmonocomponents of Qtern do not provide adequate glycaemic control, \n- when already being treated with the free combination of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin.\n\n(See sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on combinations studied.)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is one 5 mg saxagliptin/10 mg dapagliflozin tablet once daily (see sections 4.5 \nand 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nQtern can be used in patients with mild renal impairment.\n\nQtern should not be initiated in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min and \nshould be discontinued at GFR persistently below 45 mL/min. It should also not be used in patients \nwith end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThis medicinal product can be used in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment should be evaluated prior to initiation and during treatment.\nIt is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n3\n\nElderly\nThere is no restriction based solely on age. However, renal function and risk of volume depletion \nshould be taken into account in elderly patients (≥ 65 years). Based on very limited experience in\npatients 75 years and older, initiation of Qtern therapy is not recommended in this population (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of this medicinal product in children and adolescents aged 0 to < 18 years have \nnot yet been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nQtern is taken orally once daily. It may be taken at any time of day with or without food. Tablet is to \nbe swallowed whole.\n\nIf a dose is missed and it is ≥ 12 hours until the next dose, the dose should be taken. If a dose is missed \nand it is < 12 hours until the next dose, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose taken at \nthe usual time.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or history of a \nserious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and\nangioedema, to any dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or to any sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 \n(SGLT2) inhibitor (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis; persistent, severe abdominal \npain. If pancreatitis is suspected, this medicinal product should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is \nconfirmed, it should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of \npancreatitis.\n\nIn post-marketing experience of saxagliptin, there have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions \nof acute pancreatitis.\n\nMonitoring of renal function\nThe glycaemic efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in \npatients who have moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2). In subjects with moderate renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min), a \nhigher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of increase in creatinine, \nphosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypotension, compared with placebo. Qtern should not \nbe initiated in patients with a GFR < 60 mL/min and should be discontinued at GFR persistently below \n45 mL/min. Qtern has not been studied in severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage \nrenal disease (ESRD).\n\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as follows:\n• Prior to initiation of this medicinal product and at least yearly, thereafter (see sections 4.2, \n\n4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n• Prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and\n\nperiodically thereafter.\n• For renal function approaching moderate renal impairment, at least 2 to 4 times per year. If \n\nrenal function persistently falls below GFR < 45 mL/min, Qtern treatment should be \ndiscontinued.\n\n\n\n4\n\nUse in patients at risk for volume depletion, hypotension and/or electrolyte imbalances\nDue to dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action, Qtern increases diuresis associated with a modest \ndecrease in blood pressure (see section 5.1), which may be more pronounced in patients with very high \nblood glucose concentrations.\n\nThis medicinal product is not recommended for use in patients at risk of volume depletion (e.g.\nreceiving loop diuretics) (see section 4.5) or who are volume depleted, e.g. due to acute illness (such as \nacute gastrointestinal illness with nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea).\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could \npose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy \nwith a history of hypotension or elderly patients.\n\nFor patients receiving Qtern, in case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion, \ncareful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, \nlaboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended. Temporary interruption of \ntreatment with this medicinal product is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until \nthe depletion is corrected (see section 4.8).\n\nUse in patients with hepatic impairment\nThere is limited experience in clinical trials in patients with hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin and \nsaxagliptin exposure is increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nQtern can be used in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment should be evaluated prior to initiation and during treatment. This medicinal \nproduct is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been \nreported in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. In a number of cases, the \npresentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below \n14 mmol/litres (250 mg/dL). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of \ndapagliflozin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with Qtern should be discontinued \nimmediately.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with dapagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating Qtern, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should be \nconsidered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or \npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients. \n\n\n\n5\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Qtern in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and Qtern \nshould not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes mellitus studies\nwith dapagliflozin, DKA was reported with common frequency.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene)\nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene) have \nbeen reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (see section 4.8). This is a rare but \nserious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic \ntreatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier’s \ngangrene is suspected, Qtern should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics and \nsurgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nQtern must not be used in patients who have had any serious hypersensitivity reaction to a \nDPP-4 inhibitor or a SGLT2 inhibitor (see section 4.3).\n\nDuring post-marketing experience with saxagliptin, including spontaneous reports and clinical trials,\nthe following adverse reactions have been reported with the use of saxagliptin: serious\nhypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and angioedema. \nQtern should be discontinued if a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. The event should be \nassessed and alternative treatment for diabetes should be instituted (see section 4.8).\n\nUrinary tract infections\nIn the pooled safety data, urinary tract infections were frequently reported across the 3 treatment \ngroups: 5.7 % in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group 7.4 % in the saxagliptin plus \nmetformin group and 5.6 % in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group at 52 weeks (see section 4.8).\nAdditionally, urinary tract infections were frequently reported in saxagliptin and dapagliflozin clinical \nprogrammes. \n\nUrosepsis and pyelonephritis\nThere have been post-marketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and \npyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors. \nTreatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Patients with signs and \nsymptoms of urinary tract infections should be evaluated and promptly treated, if indicated (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nElderly\nElderly patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, and may be at a greater risk for \nvolume depletion. In addition, elderly patients are more likely to be treated with anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products that may cause volume depletion and/or changes in renal function [e.g.\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB)]. \nTherefore, renal function and risk of volume depletion should be taken into account prior to starting \ntreatment with Qtern. The same recommendations for monitoring of renal function apply to elderly \npatients as to all patients (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1).\n\nIn subjects ≥ 65 years of age, a higher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse \nreactions related to volume depletion and renal impairment or failure compared with placebo (see \nsection 4.8). The most commonly reported adverse reaction related to renal function was serum \ncreatinine increases, the majority of which were transient and reversible (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n6\n\nTherapeutic experience with Qtern in patients 65 years and older is limited, and very limited in patients \n75 years and older. Initiation of this medicinal product’s therapy in this population (> 75 years) is not\nrecommended (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).\n\nSkin disorders\nUlcerative and necrotic skin lesions have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-clinical \ntoxicology studies with saxagliptin (see section 5.3). Skin lesions were not observed at an increased \nincidence in saxagliptin clinical trials. Post-marketing reports of rash have been described in the DPP-4 \ninhibitor class. Rash is also noted as an adverse reaction for this medicinal product (see section 4.8).\nTherefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, such as\nblistering, ulceration or rash, is recommended.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nPostmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP4 \ninhibitor use, including saxagliptin. In reported cases, patients typically responded to topical or \nsystemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP4 inhibitor. If a patient \ndevelops blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin and bullous pemphigoid is suspected, this \nmedicinal product should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for \ndiagnosis and appropriate treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nCardiac failure\nExperience in NYHA class I-II is limited in dapagliflozin. There is no experience in clinical trials with \ndapagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. Experience in NYHA class III-IV is limited with saxagliptin.\n\nIn the SAVOR trial, a small increase in the rate for hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the \nsaxagliptin-treated patients compared to placebo, although a causal relationship has not been \nestablished (see section 5.1). Additional analysis did not indicate a differential effect among NYHA\nclasses.\n\nCaution is warranted if Qtern is used in patients who have known risk factors for hospitalisation for \nheart failure, such as a history of heart failure or moderate to severe renal impairment. Patients should \nbe advised of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms.\n\nArthralgia\nJoint pain, which may be severe, has been reported in post-marketing reports for DPP-4 inhibitors (see \nsection 4.8). Patients experienced relief of symptoms after discontinuation of the medicinal product\nand some experienced recurrence of symptoms with reintroduction of the same or another DPP-4 \ninhibitor. Onset of symptoms following initiation of therapy may be rapid or may occur after longer \nperiods of treatment. If a patient presents with severe joint pain, continuation of therapy should be \nindividually assessed.\n\nUse in patients treated with pioglitazone\nWhile a causal relationship between dapagliflozin and bladder cancer is unlikely (see sections 4.8 and \n5.3), as a precautionary measure, Qtern is not recommended for use in patients concomitantly treated \nwith pioglitazone. Available epidemiological data for pioglitazone suggest a small increased risk of \nbladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone.\n\nImmunocompromised patients\nImmunocompromised patients, such as patients who have undergone organ transplantation or patients \ndiagnosed with human immunodeficiency syndrome have not been studied in the saxagliptin clinical \nprogramme. The efficacy and safety profile of Qtern in these patients has not been established.\n\nElevated haematocrit\nHaematocrit increase was observed with dapagliflozin treatment, (see section 4.8); therefore, caution \nin patients with already elevated haematocrit is warranted.\n\n\n\n7\n\nLower limb amputations\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term, clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot care.\n\nUse with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia\nBoth saxagliptin and dapagliflozin can individually increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when \ncombined with an insulin secretagogue. If Qtern is used in combination with insulin secretagogue \n(sulphonylurea), a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may be required to minimize the risk of \nhypoglycaemia (see section 4.8).\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking Qtern will test positive for glucose in their urine.\n\nUse with potent CYP3A4 inducers\nUsing CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampicin\nmay reduce the glycaemic lowering effect of Qtern. Glycaemic control should be assessed when it is \nused concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4/5 inducer (see section 4.5).\n\nLactose\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total\nlactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nDiuretics\nDapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of \ndehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nUse with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia\nIf Qtern is used in combination with insulin secretagogue (sulphonylurea), a reduction in the dose of \nsulphonylurea may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nSaxagliptin: The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 \n(CYP3A4/5). \n\nDapagliflozin: The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by \nUDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9).\n\nInteractions with other oral anti-diabetic or cardiovascular medicinal products\nSaxagliptin: Saxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin, \nmetformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, diltiazem or simvastatin. These medicinal products\ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin or its major active metabolite.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin, \nmetformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, \nvalsartan, or simvastatin. These medications did not alter the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on saxagliptin or dapagliflozin\nSaxagliptin: Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 \ndiltiazem, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 63 % and 2.1-fold, respectively, and the\ncorresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 44 % and 34 %, respectively. These \npharmacokinetic effects are not clinically meaningful and do not require dose adjustment.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, \n\n\n\n8\n\nincreased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62 % and 2.5-fold, respectively, and the corresponding \nvalues for the active metabolite were decreased by 95 % and 88 %, respectively. These \npharmacokinetic effects are not clinically meaningful and do not require dose adjustment.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin reduced Cmax \nand AUC of saxagliptin by 53 % and 76 %, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the \nplasma DPP-4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nThe coadministration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin (such as \ncarbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital and phenytoin) has not been studied and may result in \ndecreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. \nGlycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent \nCYP3A4/5 inducer.\n\nIn studies conducted in healthy subjects, neither the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin nor its major\nmetabolite were meaningfully altered by metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin,\nomeprazole, antacids or famotidine.\n\nDapagliflozin: Following coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various \nactive transporters and drug-metabolising enzymes) a 22 % decrease in dapagliflozin systemic \nexposure (AUC) was observed, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose \nexcretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected.\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55 % \nincrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on \n24-hour urinary glucose excretion.\n\nEffect of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin on other medicinal products\nSaxagliptin: Saxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide\n(a CYP2C9 substrate), pioglitazone [a CYP2C8 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) substrate], digoxin (a \nP-gp substrate), simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), the active components of a combined oral \ncontraceptive (ethinylestradiol and norgestimate), diltiazem or ketoconazole.\n\nDapagliflozin: In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, \ndapagliflozin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone [a CYP2C8 (major) and \nCYP3A4 (minor) substrate], sitagliptin, glimepiride (a CYP2C9 substrate), hydrochlorothiazide, \nbumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P-gp substrate) or warfarin (S-warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the \nanticoagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of dapagliflozin \n20 mg and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19 % increase in AUC of simvastatin and \n31 % increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and simvastatin acid exposures \nare not considered clinically relevant.\n\nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative \nmethods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nwith saxagliptin have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). Studies with \ndapagliflozin in rats have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to \nthe second and third trimesters of human pregnancy (see section 5.3). Therefore, Qtern should not be \nused during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected, treatment with Qtern should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n9\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nAnimal studies have shown excretion of saxagliptin and/or metabolite in milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of dapagliflozin/metabolites in \nmilk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in breast-feeding offspring (see section 5.3). A \nrisk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Qtern should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin on fertility in humans has not been studied. In male and \nfemale rats, dapagliflozin showed no effects on fertility at any dose tested. Effects on fertility were\nobserved using saxagliptin in male and female rats at high doses producing overt signs of toxicity (see\nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nQtern has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When driving or using \nmachines, it should be taken into account that dizziness has been reported in studies with combined \nuse of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of\nhypoglycaemia if used in combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause \nhypoglycaemia (e.g. sulphonylureas).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin\nThe combination of saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg in 1169 adults with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin has been evaluated in three Phase 3, \nrandomised, double-blind, active/placebo-control, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trials for up to \n52 weeks (see section 5.1). The pooled safety analysis comprised 3 treatment groups: saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin (492 subjects), saxagliptin plus metformin (336 subjects), and \ndapagliflozin plus metformin (341 subjects). The safety profile of the combined use of saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin was comparable to the adverse reactions identified for the respective \nmono-components.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions of Qtern are presented in table 1 based on the summarized data from the \nsaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination clinical trials pooled safety data. The adverse reactions are listed \nby system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequency categories were defined according to very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to ˂ 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to ˂ 1/100), rare ( 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1.

Preferred terms reported in \n\ndapagliflozin clinical trials included in order of frequency: rash, rash generalised, rash pruritic, rash macular, \nrash maculo-papular, rash pustular, rash vesicular, and rash erythematous.\n\n7 See section 4.4\n\nSU = sulphonylurea\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nHypoglycaemia\nIn the pooled safety analysis, the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia (all reported events including \nthose with central laboratory FPG ≤ 3.9 mmol/L) was 2.0% in subjects treated with saxagliptin 5 mg \nplus dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin (combination therapy), 0.6% in the saxagliptin plus\nmetformin group, and 2.3% in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group. \n\nIn a 24-week study comparing the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin with \nor without SU, with insulin plus metformin with or without SU, the overall incidence rates for \nhypoglycaemia in patients without a background treatment of SU, were 12.7% for the combination \ncompared to 33.1% for insulin. The overall incidence rates of hypoglycaemia in two 52-week studies \ncomparing the combination therapy to glimepiride (SU) were: for the 1st study, 4.2% for the \ncombination therapy versus 27.9% for glimepiride plus metformin versus 2.9% for dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin; for the 2nd study, 18.5% for the combination therapy versus 43.1% for glimepiride plus \nmetformin.\n\nVolume depletion\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: Events related to volume depletion (hypotension, dehydration, \nand hypovolaemia) were reflective of the adverse events with dapagliflozin and were reported in two \nsubjects (0.4 %) in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group (serious adverse event \n[SAE] of syncope and an AE of urine output decreased), and 3 subjects (0.9 %) in the dapagliflozin \nplus metformin group (2 AEs of syncope and 1 of hypotension).\n\nEvents related to decreased renal function\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: In the pooled safety analysis, the incidence of adverse events\nrelated to decreased renal function was 2.0 % subjects in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin group, 1.8 % subjects in the saxagliptin plus metformin group, and 0.6 % subjects in the \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group. Subjects with adverse events of renal impairment had lower mean \neGFR values at baseline of 61.8 mL/min/1.73m2 compared to 93.6 mL/min/1.73m2 in the overall \npopulation. The majority of events were considered non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and \nresolved. The change in mean eGFR from baseline at Week 24 was -1.17 mL/min/1.73m2 in the \nsaxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group, -0.46 mL/min/1.73 m2 in saxagliptin plus \nmetformin, and 0.81 mL/min/1.73m2 in dapagliflozin plus metformin.\n\nDapagliflozin: Adverse reactions related to increased creatinine have been reported for dapagliflozin \nas a mono-component. The increases in creatinine were generally transient during continuous \ntreatment or reversible after discontinuation of treatment.\n\n\n\n12\n\nVulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: The reported adverse events of vulvovaginitis, balanitis and \nrelated genital infections from pooled safety analysis were reflective of the safety profile of \ndapagliflozin. Adverse events of genital infection were reported in 3.0 % in the saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group, 0.9 % of saxagliptin plus metformin group and 5.9 % of subjects \nin the dapagliflozin plus metformin group. The majority of the genital infection adverse events were \nreported in females (84 % of subjects with a genital infection), were mild or moderate in intensity, of \nsingle occurrence, and most patients continued on therapy.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene)\nCases of Fournier’s gangrene have been reported post-marketing in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, \nincluding dapagliflozin (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study with 17,160 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and a \nmedian exposure time of 48 months, a total of 6 cases of Fournier’s gangrene were reported, one in the \ndapagliflozin-treated group and 5 in the placebo group.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, with a median exposure time of 48 months, events \nof DKA were reported in 27 patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients in the placebo \ngroup. The events occurred evenly distributed over the study period. Of the 27 patients with DKA \nevents in the dapagliflozin group, 22 had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the event. \nPrecipitating factors for DKA were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nUrinary tract infections\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: In the pooled safety analysis, urinary tract infections (UTIs)\nwere balanced across the 3 treatment groups: 5.7 % in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin group, 7.4 % in the saxagliptin plus metformin group and 5.6 % in the dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin group. One patient in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group experienced \nan SAE of pyelonephritis and discontinued treatment. The majority of the urinary tract infection \nadverse events were reported in females (81 % of subjects with UTI), were mild or moderate in \nintensity, of single occurrence, and most patients continued on therapy.\n\nCardiovascular safety\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: Cardiovascular (CV) events that were adjudicated and \nconfirmed as CV events were reported in a total of 1.0 % of subjects in the saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group, 0.6 % in the saxagliptin plus metformin group, and 0.9 % in the \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group.\n\nMalignancies\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: Malignant and unspecified neoplasms were reported in \n3 subjects included in the pooled safety data. They included adverse events of gastric neoplasm, \npancreatic cancer with hepatic metastases, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group. Considering the short latency between first drug exposure and \ntumour diagnosis, a causal relationship to any specific tumour type is considered unlikely.\n\nDapagliflozin: In the 21-study active- and placebo-controlled pool, the overall proportion of subjects \nwith malignant or unspecified tumours was similar between those treated with dapagliflozin (1.50 %) \nand placebo/comparator (1.50 %), and there was no carcinogenicity or mutagenicity signal in animal \ndata (see section 5.3). When considering the cases of tumours occurring in the different organ systems, \nthe relative risk associated with dapagliflozin was above 1 for some tumours (bladder, prostate, breast) \nand below 1 for others (e.g. blood and lymphatic, ovary, renal tract), not resulting in an overall \nincreased tumour risk associated with dapagliflozin. The increased/decreased risk was not statistically \nsignificant in any of the organ systems. Considering the lack of tumour findings in non-clinical studies \nas well as the short latency between first drug exposure and tumour diagnosis, a causal relationship is \n\n\n\n13\n\nconsidered unlikely. The numerical imbalance of breast, bladder and prostate tumours must be \nconsidered with caution; it will be further investigated in post-authorisation studies.\n\nLaboratory findings\nDecrease in lymphocyte counts\nSaxagliptin: In a pool of 5 placebo-controlled studies, a small decrease in absolute lymphocyte count \nwas observed, approximately 100 cells/microl relative to placebo. Mean absolute lymphocyte counts \nremained stable with daily dosing up to 102 weeks in duration. This decrease in mean absolute\nlymphocyte count was not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions.\n\nLipids\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: Data from the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin \ntreatment arms of 3 Phase 3 trials, demonstrated trends of mean percent increases from baseline \n(rounded to the nearest tenth) in total cholesterol (Total C), (ranging from 0.4 % to 3.8 %), LDL-C \n(ranging from 2.1 % to 6.9 %) and HDL-C (ranging 2.3 % to 5.2 %) along with mean percent \ndecreases from baseline in triglycerides (ranging from -3.0 % to -10.8 %).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: Of the 1169 subjects treated in the pooled safety data from the \n3 clinical trials, 1007 subjects (86.1 %) were aged < 65 years, 162 subjects (13.9 %) were aged \n≥ 65 years, and 9 subjects (0.8 %) were aged ≥ 75 years. Generally, the most common adverse events \nreported in ≥ 65 years old were similar to < 65 years old. Therapeutic experience in patients 65 years \nand older is limited, and very limited in patients 75 years and older.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: There is no information available on overdose with Qtern. In \nthe event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the \npatient’s clinical status. Saxagliptin and its major metabolite are removed by haemodialysis (23% of \ndose over four hours). The removal of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD21\n\nMechanism of action for Qtern\nQtern combines saxagliptin and dapagliflozin with complementary mechanisms of action to improve \nglycaemic control. Saxagliptin, through the selective inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), \nenhances glucose-mediated insulin secretion (incretin effect). Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of \nsodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), inhibits renal glucose reabsorption independently of \ninsulin. Actions of both medicinal products are regulated by the plasma glucose level.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nMechanism of action for saxagliptin\nSaxagliptin is a highly potent (Ki: 1.3 nM), selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of DPP-4, an \nenzyme responsible for the breakdown of incretin hormones. This results in a glucose-dependent \nincrease in insulin secretion, thus reducing fasting and post-prandial blood glucose concentrations.\n\nMechanism of action for dapagliflozin\nDapagliflozin is a highly potent (Ki: 0.55 nM), selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose \nco-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Dapagliflozin blocks reabsorption of filtered glucose from the S1 segment \nof the renal tubule, effectively lowering blood glucose in a glucose dependent and insulin-independent \nmanner. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by reducing renal\nglucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. The increased urinary glucose excretion \nwith SGLT2 inhibition produces an osmotic diuresis, and can result in a reduction in systolic BP.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of saxagliptin inhibited DPP-4 enzyme activity \nthroughout a 24-hour period. The inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity by saxagliptin for at least \n24 hours after oral administration of saxagliptin is due to high potency, high affinity, and extended \nbinding to the active site. After an oral glucose load, this produced in a 2- to 3-fold increase in\ncirculating levels glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic\npolypeptide (GIP), decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased beta-cell responsiveness, \nresulting in higher insulin and C-peptide concentrations. The rise in insulin from pancreatic\nbeta-cells and the decrease in glucagon from pancreatic alpha-cells were associated with lower\nfasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a\nmeal.\n\nDapagliflozin’s glucuretic effect is observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24-hour dosing \ninterval, and is sustained for the duration of treatment. Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in \nthe urine were observed in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the \nadministration of dapagliflozin. Approximately 70 g of glucose was excreted in the urine per day \n(corresponding to 280 kcal/day) at a dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg/day in subjects with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus for 12 weeks. Evidence of sustained glucose excretion was seen in subjects with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day for up to 2 years. Urinary uric acid excretion was also \nincreased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a sustained reduction in serum uric acid \nconcentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid concentrations ranged from –48.3 to –18.3 \nmicromoles/L (–0.87 to –0.33 mg/dL).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe safety and efficacy of the 5 mg saxagliptin/10 mg dapagliflozin fixed-dose combination was \nevaluated in three phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active/placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1169 \nadult subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. One trial with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin added \nconcomitantly to metformin was conducted for 24 weeks. Two add-on therapy trials, which added \neither dapagliflozin to saxagliptin plus metformin or saxagliptin to dapagliflozin plus metformin, were \nalso conducted for 24 weeks followed by a 28 week extension treatment period. The safety profile of \nthe combined use of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin in these trials for up to 52 weeks was comparable to \nthe safety profiles for the mono-components.\n\nGlycaemic control\nConcomitant therapy with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin in patients inadequately controlled on \nmetformin\nA total of 534 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control on \nmetformin alone (HbA1c ≥ 8 % and ≤ 12 %), participated in this 24-week randomised, double-blind, \nactive comparator-controlled superiority trial to compare the combination of saxagliptin and \ndapagliflozin added concurrently to metformin, versus saxagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) or dapagliflozin \n(SGLT2 inhibitor) added to metformin. Patients were randomised to one of three double-blind \ntreatment groups to receive saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg added to metformin, saxagliptin \n5 mg and placebo added to metformin, or dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo added to metformin.\n\n\n\n15\n\nThe saxagliptin and dapagliflozin group achieved significantly greater reductions in HbA1c versus \neither the saxagliptin group or dapagliflozin group at 24 weeks (see table 2).\n\nTable 2.

The combination of \nsaxagliptin and dapagliflozin added to metformin consistently demonstrated greater reductions in \nHbA1c irrespective of baseline HbA1c compared with saxagliptin or dapagliflozin alone added to \nmetformin.

Three hundred twenty (320) subjects were randomised equally \ninto either the dapagliflozin added to saxagliptin plus metformin treatment group or placebo plus \nsaxagliptin plus metformin treatment group. Patients who completed the initial 24-week study period \nwere eligible to enter a controlled 28-week long-term study extension (52 weeks).\n\nThe group with dapagliflozin sequentially added to saxagliptin and metformin achieved statistically \nsignificant (p-value < 0.0001) greater reductions in HbA1c versus the group with placebo sequentially\nadded to saxagliptin plus metformin group at 24 weeks (see table 4). The effect in HbA1c observed at \nWeek 24 was sustained at Week 52. \n\nAdd-on therapy with saxagliptin in patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin plus metformin\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7 % and ≤ 10.5 %) on metformin and \ndapagliflozin alone, compared the sequential addition of 5 mg saxagliptin to 10 mg dapagliflozin and \nmetformin, to the addition of placebo to 10 mg dapagliflozin and metformin, 153 patients were \nrandomised into the saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment group, and 162 \npatients were randomised into the placebo added to dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment group. \nPatients who completed the initial 24-week study period were eligible to enter a controlled 28 week \nlong-term study extension (52 weeks). The safety profile of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin in the long-term treatment period was consistent with that previously observed in the \nclinical trial experience for the concomitant therapy study and that observed in the 24-week treatment \nperiod in this study.\n\nThe group with saxagliptin sequentially added to dapagliflozin and metformin achieved statistically \nsignificant (p-value < 0.0001) greater reductions in HbA1c versus the group with placebo sequentially\nadded to dapagliflozin plus metformin group at 24 weeks (see table 4).

The effect in HbA1c observed at Week 24 was \nsustained at Week 52. The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7 % at week 24 for add-on \ntherapy with saxagliptin to dapagliflozin plus metformin trial was higher in the saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group 35.3 % (95 % CI [28.2, 42.2]) compared to the placebo plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group 23.1 % (95 % CI [16.9, 29.3]). The effect in HbA1c observed at \nWeek 24 was sustained at Week 52. \n\nBody weight\nIn the concomitant study, the adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight at Week 24 \n(excluding data after rescue) was −2.05 kg (95 % CI [−2.52, −1.58]) in the saxagliptin 5 mg plus\ndapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin group and −2.39 kg (95 % CI [−2.87, −1.91]) in the dapagliflozin \n10 mg plus metformin group, while the saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin group had no change \n(0.00 kg) (95 % CI [−0.48, 0.49]). \n\nBlood pressure\nTreatment with Qtern resulted in change from baseline for systolic blood pressure ranging from –1.3 to \n–2.2 mm Hg and for diastolic blood pressure ranging from –0.5 to –1.2 mm Hg caused by Qtern’s mild \ndiuretic effect. The modest lowering effects on BP were consistent over time and a similar number of \nsubjects had systolic BP < 130 mmHg or diastolic BP < 80 mmHg at Week 24 across the treatment \ngroups.\n\n\n\n18\n\nCardiovascular safety\nDapagliflozin: A meta-analysis of cardiovascular events in the clinical program was\nperformed. In the clinical program, 34.4% of subjects had a history of cardiovascular disease \n(excluding hypertension) at baseline and 67.9% had hypertension. The hazard ratio comparing\ndapagliflozin to comparator was 0.79 (95 % CI: 0.58, 1.07), indicating that in this analysis\ndapagliflozin is not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular death, MI and stroke were observed with a hazard ratio of\n0.77 (95 % CI: 0.54, 1.10).\n\nSaxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus - thrombolysis \nin myocardial infarction (SAVOR) study\nSAVOR was a CV outcome trial in 16,492 patients with HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % and < 12 % (12,959 with \nestablished CV disease; 3533 with multiple risk factors only) who were randomised to saxagliptin \n(n=8280) or placebo (n=8212) added to regional standards of care for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The \nstudy population included those ≥ 65 years (n=8561) and ≥ 75 years (n=2330), with normal or mild \nrenal impairment (n=13,916) as well as moderate (n=2240) or severe (n=336) renal impairment. \n\nThe primary safety (non-inferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint was a composite endpoint \nconsisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major adverse CV events (MACE): \nCV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal ischemic stroke.\n\nAfter a mean follow up of 2 years, the trial met its primary safety endpoint demonstrating saxagliptin \ndoes not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to placebo when \nadded to current background therapy. \n\nNo benefit was observed for MACE or all-cause mortality.\n\nOne component of the secondary composite endpoint, hospitalisation for heart failure, occurred at a \ngreater rate in the saxagliptin group (3.5 %) compared with the placebo group (2.8 %), with nominal \nstatistical significance favouring placebo [HR=1.27; (95 % CI 1.07, 1.51); P=0.007]. Clinically \nrelevant factors predictive of increased relative risk with saxagliptin treatment could not be definitively \nidentified. Subjects at higher risk for hospitalisation for heart failure, irrespective of treatment \nassignment, could be identified by known risk factors for heart failure such as baseline history of heart \nfailure or impaired renal function. However, subjects on saxagliptin with a history of heart failure or \nimpaired renal function at baseline were not at an increased risk relative to placebo for the primary or \nsecondary composite endpoints or all-cause mortality.\n\nAnother secondary endpoint, all-cause mortality, occurred at a rate of 5.1 % in the saxagliptin group \nand 4.6 % in the placebo group. CV deaths were balanced across the treatment groups. There was a \nnumerical imbalance in non-CV death, with more events on saxagliptin (1.8 %) than placebo (1.4 %) \n[HR=1.27; (95 % CI 1.00, 1.62); P=0.051].\n\nRenal impairment\nModerate renal impairment CKD 3A (eGFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)\nDapagliflozin\n\nThe efficacy of dapagliflozin was assessed in a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR ≥ 45 \nto < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who had inadequate glycaemic control on usual care. Treatment with\ndapagliflozin resulted in reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with placebo (Table 5).\n\n\n\n19\n\nTable 5.

The pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin, and saxagliptin and its major metabolite were\nsimilar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nAdministration of Qtern with a high-fat meal decreases dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 35 % and prolongs \nTmax by approximately 1.5 hours, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These \nchanges are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There was no food effect observed for \nsaxagliptin. Qtern can be administered with or without food.\n\nDrug interactions: \nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: No drug interaction studies have been performed with Qtern\nand other medicinal products. Such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances.\n\nSaxagliptin: In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, \n2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4.\n\n\n\n20\n\nDapagliflozin: In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, \nCYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, \nCYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Therefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of \ncoadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes.\n\nAbsorption\nSaxagliptin: Saxagliptin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in the fasted state, with\nmaximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of saxagliptin and its major metabolite attained within 2 and\n4 hours (Tmax), respectively. The Cmax and AUC values of saxagliptin and its major metabolite\nincreased proportionally with the increment in the saxagliptin dose, and this dose-proportionality was\nobserved in doses up to 400 mg. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects,\nthe mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 78 ng h/mL and\n214 ng h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma Cmax values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL,\nrespectively. The intra-subject coefficients of variation for saxagliptin Cmax and AUC were less than\n12 %.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum \ndapagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in \nthe fasted state. Geometric mean steady-state dapagliflozin Cmax and AUCτ values following once daily \n10 mg doses of dapagliflozin were 158 ng/mL and 628 ng h/mL, respectively. The absolute oral \nbioavailability of dapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78 %.\n\nDistribution\nSaxagliptin: The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is\nnegligible. Thus, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g. renal or hepatic\nimpairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. The volume of distribution of \nsaxagliptin was 205 l.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin is approximately 91 % protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in \nvarious disease states (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution \nof dapagliflozin was 118 l.\n\nBiotransformation\nSaxagliptin: The biotransformation of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 \n(CYP3A4/5). The major active metabolite of saxagliptin, 5-OH-saxagliptin, is also a selective,\nreversible, competitive DPP-4 inhibitor, half as potent as saxagliptin.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield \ndapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is an inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide or \nother metabolites do not contribute to the glucose-lowering effects. The formation of \ndapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an enzyme present in the liver and kidney, \nand CYP-mediated metabolism was a minor clearance pathway in humans.\n\nElimination\nSaxagliptin: The mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite\nare 2.5 hours and 3.1 hours respectively, and the mean t1/2 value for plasma DPP-4 inhibition was\n26.9 hours. Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg \ndose of 14C-saxagliptin, 24 %, 36 %, and 75 % of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, \nits active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin \n(~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), \nsuggesting some active renal excretion.\n\nDapagliflozin: The mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a \nsingle oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of \ndapagliflozin administered intravenously was 207 mL/min. Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are \nprimarily eliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2 % as unchanged dapagliflozin.\n\n\n\n21\n\nLinearity\nSaxagliptin: The Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin and its major metabolite increased proportionally to\nthe saxagliptin dose. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its major metabolite was \nobserved with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence was \nobserved in the clearance of saxagliptin and its major metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing\nwith saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 400 mg.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose \nover the range of 0.1 to 500 mg and its pharmacokinetics did not change with time upon repeated daily \ndosing for up to 24 weeks.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nSaxagliptin: After a single dose of saxagliptin in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (or ESRD) classified on the basis of creatinine clearance the mean AUC values of \nsaxagliptin were 1.2-, and up to 2.1- and 4.5- fold higher, respectively, than AUC values in subjects \nwith normal renal function. The AUC values of 5-OH-saxagliptin were also increased. The degree of \nrenal impairment did not affect the Cmax of saxagliptin or its major metabolite.\n\nDapagliflozin: At steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), subjects with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol plasma \nclearance) had mean systemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32 %, 60 % and 87 % higher, respectively, \nthan those of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The steady-state \n24-hour urinary glucose excretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of \nglucose/day was excreted by subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, \nmoderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. The impact of hemodialysis on dapagliflozin \nexposure is not known.\n\nHepatic impairment\nSaxagliptin: In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), or severe \n(Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment the exposures to saxagliptin were 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.8-fold \nhigher, respectively, and the exposures to BMS-510849 (saxagliptin metabolite) were 22 %, 7 %\nand 33 % lower, respectively, than those observed in healthy subjects.\n\nDapagliflozin: In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), \nmean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12 % and 36 % higher, respectively, compared to \nhealthy matched control subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. \nIn subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin \nwere 40 % and 67 % higher than matched healthy controls, respectively.\n\nElderly\nSaxagliptin: Elderly patients (65–80 years) had about 60 % higher saxagliptin AUC than young\npatients (18–40 years). This is not considered clinically meaningful, therefore, no dose adjustment for\nsaxagliptin is recommended on the basis of age alone.\n\nDapagliflozin: There is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects \nup to 70 years old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can \nbe expected. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients \n> 70 years old.\n\nGender\nSaxagliptin: Females had approximately 25 % higher systemic exposure values for saxagliptin. There \nwere no clinically relevant differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and \nfemales.\n\n\n\n22\n\nDapagliflozin: The mean dapagliflozin AUCss in females was estimated to be about 22 % higher than \nin males.\n\nRace\nSaxagliptin: Race was not identified as a statistically significant covariate on the apparent clearance of \nsaxagliptin and its metabolite.\n\nDapagliflozin: There were no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposures between White, \nBlack or Asian races.\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased weight. Consequently, \nlow-weight patients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with high-weight somewhat \ndecreased exposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful.\n\nSaxagliptin: Body weight had a small and non-clinically meaningful impact on saxagliptin exposure.\nFemales had approximately 25% higher systemic-exposure values for saxagliptin, this difference is \nconsidered not clinically relevant.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical studies of either saxagliptin or dapagliflozin revealed no special hazard for humans based \non conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity. \n\nSaxagliptin produced reversible skin lesions (scabs, ulcerations and necrosis) in extremities (tail, digits,\nscrotum and/or nose) in cynomolgus monkeys. The no effect level (NOEL) for the lesions is 1 and \n2 times the human exposure of saxagliptin and the major metabolite respectively, at the recommended \nhuman dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. The clinical relevance of the skin lesions is not known and skin\nlesions have not been observed in humans.\n\nImmune related findings of minimal, nonprogressive, lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen, lymph nodes and \nbone marrow with no adverse sequelae have been reported in all species tested at exposures starting\nfrom 7 times the RHD.\n\nSaxagliptin produced gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs, including bloody/mucoid faeces and \nenteropathy at higher doses with a NOEL 4 and 2 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the \nmajor metabolite, respectively at RHD. The effect on offspring body weights were noted until \npostnatal day 92 and 120 in females and males, respectively.\n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity\nSaxagliptin has effects on fertility in male and female rats at high doses producing overt signs of\ntoxicity. Saxagliptin was not teratogenic at any doses evaluated in rats or rabbits. At high doses in rats, \nsaxagliptin caused reduced ossification (a developmental delay) of the foetal pelvis and decreased \nfoetal body weight (in the presence of maternal toxicity), with a NOEL 303 and 30 times the human \nexposure for saxagliptin and the major metabolite, respectively, at RHD. In rabbits, the effects of \nsaxagliptin were limited to minor skeletal variations observed only at maternally toxic doses (NOEL \n158 and 224 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the major metabolite, respectively at\nRHD). In a pre- and postnatal developmental study in rats, saxagliptin caused decreased pup weight at \nmaternally toxic doses, with NOEL 488 and 45 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the \nmajor metabolite, respectively at RHD. The effect on offspring body weights were noted until postnatal \nday 92 and 120 in females and males, respectively.\n\nDirect administration of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and indirect exposure during late \npregnancy (corresponding to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with respect to human renal \nmaturation) and lactation are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of renal pelvic \nand tubular dilatations in progeny.\n\n\n\n23\n\nIn a juvenile study, when dapagliflozin was dosed directly to young rats from postnatal day 21 until \npostnatal day 90, renal pelvic and tubular dilatations (with dose-related increases in kidney weight and \nmacroscopic kidney enlargement) were reported at all dose levels; pup exposures at the lowest dose \ntested were ≥ 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. The renal pelvic and tubular \ndilatations observed in juvenile animals did not fully reverse within the approximate 1-month recovery \nperiod.\n\nDapagliflozin dosed to maternal rats from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 21, and pups were \nindirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. Increased incidence or severity of renal pelvic \ndilatation was observed in adult offspring of treated dams, although only at the highest dose tested (at \nmaternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures of 1415 times and 137 times, respectively, the human values \nat the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Additional developmental toxicity was limited \nto dose-related reductions in pup body weights, and observed only at doses ≥ 15 mg/kg/day (pup \nexposures ≥ 29 times the human values at the MRHD). Maternal toxicity was evident only at the \nhighest dose tested, and limited to transient reductions in body weight and food consumption at dose. \nThe NOAEL for developmental toxicityis associated with a maternal systemic exposure 19 times the \nhuman values at the MRHD.\n\nIn studies of embryo-foetal development in rabbits, dapagliflozin caused neither maternal nor \ndevelopmental toxicities at any dose tested; the highest dose tested corresponded to a systemic \nexposure 1191 times the MRHD. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at \nexposures up to 1441 times the human values at the MRHD.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Qtern is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Qtern\n3. How to take Qtern\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Qtern\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Qtern is and what it is used for\n\nQtern contains the active substances saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. Each belongs to a group of \nmedicines called “oral anti-diabetics”.\n\n- This medicine is taken by mouth for diabetes.\n- This medicine is used if your diabetes cannot be controlled with other oral diabetes medicines, \n\nalong with diet and exercise.\n\nQtern is used for a type of diabetes called “type 2 diabetes mellitus” in adult patients (aged 18 years \nand older). “Type 2 diabetes mellitus” is the type of diabetes that usually starts when you are older. If \nyou have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin or your body is not able to use \nthe insulin it produces properly. This leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. The two active \nsubstances in Qtern work in different ways to help control the level of sugar in your blood and remove \nexcess sugar from your body via your urine.\n\nIt is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Qtern\n\nDo not take Qtern:\n- if you are allergic to saxagliptin, dapagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n- if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines (for example DPP-4 \n\ninhibitors like sitagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin, or SGLT2 inhibitors like canagliflozin, \nempagliflozin) that you take to control your blood sugar.\n\nDo not take Qtern if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, \nor nurse before taking Qtern.\n\n\n\n35\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Qtern, and during treatment:\n- if you have “type 1 diabetes” (the type that usually starts when you are young, and your body \n\ndoes not produce any insulin).\n- if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.\n- if you have reduced kidney function.\n- if you have a condition that reduces your body’s ability to fight infections, such as a disease like \n\nAIDS or from medicines that you might take after an organ transplant.\n- if you have moderate or severe liver problem.\n- if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, \n\nfast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, \na sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a \ndoctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of “diabetic \nketoacidosis” – a rare but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes \nbecause of increased levels of “ketone bodies” in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of \ndeveloping diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol \nconsumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to \nmajor surgery or serious illness.\n\n- if you have or have had a serious hypersensitivity reaction or is suspected.\n- if you have a history of serious heart disease.\n- if you suffer from heart failure or you have other risk factors for developing heart failure such as \n\nproblems with your kidneys. Your doctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart \nfailure. Symptoms can include, but are not limited to, increasing shortness of breath, rapid \nincrease in weight and swelling of the feet (pedal oedema). You should call your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.\n\n- if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of \nlow blood pressure (hypotension). For more information, see section “Other medicines and \nQtern” below.\n\n- if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too \nmuch body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed at the top of section 4. Tell your \ndoctor before you start taking Qtern if you have any of these signs.\n\n- if you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or \ndrink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Qtern \nuntil you recover to prevent dehydration.\n\n- if you often get infections of the urinary tract or have a serious infection of the urinary tract, \nincluding urosepsis or pyelonephritis, which can cause fever and/or chills, burning sensation \nwhen passing water (urinating), blood in urine, pain in your back or side. You should call your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.\n\n- if you are 75 years old or older.\n- if you are taking a medicine to lower your blood sugar, such as insulin or sulphonylureas.\n- if you are taking another medicine for diabetes that contains “pioglitazone”.\n- if you have an increase in the amount of red blood cells in your blood, seen in tests.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking Qtern.\n\nDiabetic skin lesions (skin damage such as sores or ulcers) are a common complication of diabetes. \nRash has been seen with both saxagliptin and dapagliflozin when given separately (see section 4). You \nare advised to follow the recommendations for skin care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.\nContact your doctor if you encounter blistering of the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called \nbullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop Qtern.\n\nLike for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice \nregarding foot care given by your health care professional.\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \n\n\n\n36\n\ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier’s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\nKidney function\nYour kidneys should be checked before you start taking and whilst you are on this medicine.\n\nUrine tests\nBecause of how Qtern works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nQtern is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because it has not been \nstudied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Qtern\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nEspecially tell your doctor:\n- if you are taking a medicine used to increase the amount of water you pass out of the body \n\n(diuretic). Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Qtern. Possible signs of losing too much fluid \nfrom your body are listed at the top of section 4.\n\n- if you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances:\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or \n\nchronic pain.\n- Dexamethasone – a steroid medicine. This may be used to treat inflammation in different\n\nbody parts and organs.\n- Rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.\n- Ketoconazole. This may be used to treat fungal infections.\n- Diltiazem. This is a medicine used to treat angina (chest pain) and lower blood pressure.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or if you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking Qtern.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Qtern is not recommended during \npregnancy and your doctor will ask you to stop taking this medicine if you become pregnant. Talk to \nyour doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant.\n\nYou should not use Qtern if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if this medicine passes into human \nbreast milk. Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nQtern is not expected to affect you being able to drive a car or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndizzy while taking Qtern, do not drive or use any tools or machines. Taking this medicine can cause \nblood sugar levels to fall too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, \nsweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nQtern contains lactose\nQtern contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance \nto some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\nSodium content\nQtern contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to take Qtern\n\n\n\n37\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\n- The recommended dose is one tablet a day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n- Swallow the tablet whole with half a glass of water.\n- You can take your tablet with or without food.\n- You can take the tablet at any time of the day. However, try to take it at the same time each day. \n\nThis will help you to remember to take it.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe other medicines to lower the amount of sugar in your blood. Remember to \ntake other medicine(s) as your doctor has told you. This will help get the best results for your health.\n\nDiet and exercise\nTo control your diabetes, you still need to keep to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this \nmedicine. So it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse. In particular, if you are following a diabetic weight control diet, continue to \nfollow it while you are taking Qtern.\n\nIf you take more Qtern than you should\nIf you take more Qtern tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take \nthe medicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take Qtern\nWhat to do if you forget to take a tablet.\n- If it is less than 12 hours since you should have taken your dose, take a dose of Qtern as soon as \n\nyou remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time.\n- If it is more than 12 hours since you should have taken your dose, skip the missed dose. Then \n\ntake your next dose at the usual time.\n- Do not take a double dose of Qtern to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Qtern\nDo not stop taking Qtern without talking to your doctor first. Your blood sugar may increase without \nthis medicine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.
