NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n\nTrudexa 40 mg solution for injection. \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n\nEach 0.8 ml single dose vial contains 40 mg of adalimumab.  \nAdalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\nSolution for injection. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate. \n\n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate. \n\n \nTrudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n \nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nTrudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease, in patients who have not \nresponded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \nFor induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with cortiocosteroids.  Trudexa can \nbe given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with \ncorticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n\nTrudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn’s \ndisease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\nAdults \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Trudexa. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an \nincrease in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \n\nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is \n40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn’s disease is \n80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to \ntherapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as \ntwo injections per day for two consecutive days), 80  mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness \nthat the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, \nTrudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re-administration after more than \n8 weeks since the previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose \nintensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required.   \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no experience in children. \n\nImpaired renal and/or hepatic function \n\nTrudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section \n4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use   \n\nInfections \n \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after \ntreatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, \nmonitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalized infections until infections are controlled.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored \nclosely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious \ninfection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use \nof Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may \npredispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have \nbeen reported with Trudexa.   \n \nSerious infections: \n \nIn clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, \nand reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are \ninfections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia.   \n \nTuberculosis: \n \nThere have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the \nmajority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a \npersonal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is \nrecommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers \nare reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are \nseverely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local \nrecommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the \nbenefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after \ntherapy with Trudexa.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections: \n \nThere have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa \ntherapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and \naspergillosis. \n \nIf a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general \ndeterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. \n \nHepatitis B Reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV \ninfection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy.  \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n\nNeurological events  \n\nTNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should \nexercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central \nnervous system demyelinating disorders.  \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa \nduring clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during \nclinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported \nvery rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic \nreaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate \ntherapy initiated.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\nThe needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \nreactions in patients sensitive to latex. \n\nImmunosuppression \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and \nneutrophils. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background \nlymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory \ndisease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the \ndevelopment of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution \nshould be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients.  \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking \nagents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should \nbe advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of \nblood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation \nof Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \nabnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent \nvaccinations, except for live vaccines. \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in \npatients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe \nheart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop \nnew or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\nAutoimmune processes \n\nTreatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies.  The impact of long-\nterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient \ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is \npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be \ngiven (see section 4.8). \n\nConcurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. \n\nSurgery \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long \nhalf-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A \npatient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving Trudexa.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\nTrudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as \nmonotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when \nTrudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy.  \nAdministration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, \nincreased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation  \n\nFor Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of \nadalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during \npregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception \nto prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n\nUse during lactation  \n\nIt is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n8 \n\nHowever, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at \nleast five months after the last Trudexa treatment. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nClinical Trials \n \nTrudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These \ntrials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as \npsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based \non the controlled Studies (I − IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) \ninvolving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator \nduring the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM  was 5.7% for patients taking \nTrudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. \n \nAdverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN \nand CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very \ncommon ≥ 1/10; common≥ 1/100 < 1/10; uncommon≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare < 1/1000 in Table \n1 below.

trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions \n(erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving \nplacebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the \nmedicinal product.  \n\nInfections  \n\nIn the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated \npatients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections \nconsisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most \npatients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which \noccurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and \nextra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, \npneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis \noccurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of \nlatent disease. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nDuring the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) \nin patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing \nspondylitis and Crohn’s disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among \n2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 \ncontrol patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for control-\ntreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, \n12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years \namong control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% \nconfidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per \n1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 \n(0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patient-\nyears among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label \nextension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over \n13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, \nthe reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and \nlymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\nAutoantibodies  \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nStudies I − V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres \nat week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.

In patients with early \nrheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more \ncommon in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy \narm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients \n(Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. \n \nIn all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were \ntransient and resolved on continued treatment. \n \nCrohn’s disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients \nreceiving adalimumab or placebo. \n\nAdditional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials \n\nThe additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or \nPhase IV clinical trials: \n \n\nTable 2 \nUndesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies \n\n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \nHepatobiliary Disorders reactivation of hepatitis B \nNervous system disorders demyelinating disorders (e.g. optic neuritis) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary \n\nfibrosis  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders cutaneous vasculitis \nImmune system disorders anaphylaxis \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10-10 M).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n13 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\nAfter treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn’s disease. \n\nClinical trials \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients \nwere treated for  up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of \nrheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies.   \n \nStudy I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nStudy II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nStudy III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-\nintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week.  \nThere were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks.  \nThe second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of \nTrudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 \nmonths. \n \nStudy IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa \nor placebo every other week for 24 weeks.   \n \nStudy V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of \nTrudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of \nprogression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. \n \nThe primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent \nof patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V \nwas the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.

Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy \nwas clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy \n(p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe \nrheumatoid arthritis.  The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). \n\nRadiographic response \n\nIn Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing \nscore.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than \npatients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label \nextension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained \nfor 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every \nother week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. \n \n\nTable 5:  Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in Study III \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXa \n\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n(95% Confidence \n\nIntervalb) \n\nP-value \n\nTotal Sharp score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8)  < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Trudexa.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn Study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified total Sharp score (see Table 6). \n \n\nTable 6:  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in Study V \n \n\n \nMTX \nn=257 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa \nn=274 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa/MT\nX \n\nn=268 \np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n16 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTotal Sharp \nscore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001 \nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and methotrexate \nmonotherapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression \n(change from baseline in modified total Sharp score ≤ 0.5) was significantly higher with \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate \nmonotherapy (37.4% and 33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 \nand 44.5%, p < 0.001 respectively). \n\nQuality of life and physical function  \n\nHealth-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa \nin all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the \nHAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52.  \nResults from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four \nstudies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) \nscores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other \nweek dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of \nchronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies \nI, III, IV). \n \nIn Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of \nopen-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and \nimprovement was maintained through that time. \n \nIn Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic \narthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, \ntreated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \ntherapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.  Study VII with 12-week duration, \ntreated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Trudexa in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like \npsoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied (see Table 7). \n \n\nTable 7:  ACR Response in Placebo-Controlled Psoriatic Arthritis Studies \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n \n Study VI Study VII \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n17 \n\nResponse Placebo N=162 \nTrudexa \nN=151 \n\nPlacebo  \nN=49 \n\nTrudexa \nN=51 \n\nACR 20      \n Week 12 14% 58%*** 16% 39%* \n Week 24 15% 57%*** N/A N/A \nACR 50      \n Week 12 4% 36%*** 2% 25%*** \n Week 24 6% 39%*** N/A N/A \nACR 70      \n Week 12 1% 20%*** 0% 14% * \n Week 24 1% 23%*** N/A N/A \n\n*** p < 0.001 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo \n* p < 0.05 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo   \nN/A  not applicable \n\n \nACR responses in Study VI were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. \nTrudexa treated patients demonstrated improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and \nShort Form Health Survey (SF 36), from base-line to week 24. \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \n\nTrudexa 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week \ndouble − blind, placebo − controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean \nbaseline score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] \nwas 6.3 in all groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  Seventy-nine \n(20.1%) patients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 \n(9.4%) patients with glucocorticoids.  The blinded period was followed by an open − label period \nduring which patients received Trudexa 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an \nadditional 28 weeks.  Subjects (n = 215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at Weeks 12, or 16 or \n20 received early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were \nsubsequently treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger study (VIII) with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with Trudexa compared to placebo.  \nSignificant response was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (Table 8).  \n\n \nTable 8 - Efficacy Responses in Placebo-Controlled AS Study – Study VIII \n\nReduction of Signs and Symptoms \n \n\nResponse Placebo \nN=107 \n\nTrudexa \nN=208 \n\nASASa 20   \n             Week 2 16% 42%*** \n\nWeek 12 21% 58%*** \nWeek 24 19% 51%*** \n\nASAS 50   \n             Week 2 3% 16%*** \n\nWeek 12 10% 38%*** \nWeek 24 11% 35%*** \n\nASAS 70   \n             Week 2 0% 7%** \n\nWeek 12 5% 23%*** \nWeek 24 8% 24%*** \n\n   \nBASDAIb 50    \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n18 \n\n             Week 2 4% 20%*** \nWeek 12  16% 45%*** \nWeek 24  15% 42%*** \n\n***,** Statistically significant at p < 0.001, < 0.01 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo at Weeks \n2, 12 and  24 \na ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis \nb Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \n\n \nTrudexa treated patients had significantly greater improvement at Week 12 which was maintained \nthrough Week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire \n(ASQoL). \n \nSimilar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double − blind, \nplacebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nCrohn’s Disease \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a \nsevere disease (CDAI score > 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) \ncorresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses \nof aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of \npatients continued to receive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and \nGAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment \ngroups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 \nand 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost \nresponse or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from \nthe studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received \nopen-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every \nother week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical \nresponse (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in \nclinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8.  \n \nCLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n19 \n\nTable 9: Induction of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CLASSIC I: Infliximab Naive Patients GAIN: Infliximab Experienced Patients \n\n Placebo \n\nN=74 \n\nTrudexa \n\n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 mg \nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=166 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Trudexa versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis.

Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section \n4.2).   \n\nQuality of Life \n\nIn CLASSIC I and GAIN, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n20 \n\nTrudexa 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CHARM \nas well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n\nImmunogenicity   \n\nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand adverse events. \n \nPatients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during \nthe 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 \n(5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as \nadd-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) \ntreated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% \n(24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to \nmethotrexate. \n \nIn patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated \nwith adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), \ncompared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) \ntreated with adalimumab. \n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-\nlife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The \nserum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following \n20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/ml were observed \nin Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.

Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic \nor renal impairment. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate \nmodels for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of \nneutralizing antibodies in rodents.  \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate. \n\n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate. \n\n \nTrudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n \nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nTrudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease, in patients who have not \nresponded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \nFor induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with corticosteroids.  Trudexa can be \ngiven as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with \ncorticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n24 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n\nTrudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn’s \ndisease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\nAdults \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Trudexa. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an \nincrease in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \n\nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is \n40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn’s disease is \n80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to \ntherapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as \ntwo injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness \nthat the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, \nTrudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 \nweeks since the previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose \nintensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n25 \n\nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required.   \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n There is no experience in children. \n\nImpaired renal and/or hepatic function \n\nTrudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section \n4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use   \n\nInfections \n \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after \ntreatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, \nmonitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalized infections until infections are controlled.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored \nclosely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious \ninfection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use \nof Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may \npredispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have \nbeen reported with Trudexa.   \n \nSerious infections: \n \nIn clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, \nand reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are \ninfections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia.   \n \nTuberculosis: \n \nThere have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the \nmajority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n26 \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a \npersonal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is \nrecommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers \nare reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are \nseverely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local \nrecommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the \nbenefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after \ntherapy with Trudexa.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections: \n \nThere have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa \ntherapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and \naspergillosis. \n \nIf a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general \ndeterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. \n \nHepatitis B Reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV \ninfection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy.  \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n\nNeurological events  \n\nTNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should \nexercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central \nnervous system demyelinating disorders.  \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa \nduring clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during \nclinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported \nvery rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic \nreaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate \ntherapy initiated.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n27 \n\nThe needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \nreactions in patients sensitive to latex. \n\nImmunosuppression \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and \nneutrophils. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background \nlymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory \ndisease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the \ndevelopment of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution \nshould be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients.  \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking \nagents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should \nbe advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of \nblood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation \nof Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \nabnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent \nvaccinations, except for live vaccines. \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in \npatients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe \nheart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop \nnew or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n28 \n\nAutoimmune processes \n\nTreatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies.  The impact of long-\nterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient \ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is \npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be \ngiven (see section 4.8). \n\nConcurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. \n\nSurgery \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long \nhalf-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A \npatient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving Trudexa.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\nTrudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as \nmonotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when \nTrudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy.  \nAdministration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, \nincreased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation  \n\nFor Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of \nadalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during \npregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception \nto prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n\nUse during lactation  \n\nIt is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n29 \n\nHowever, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at \nleast five months after the last Trudexa treatment. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nClinical Trials \n \nTrudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These \ntrials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as \npsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based \non the controlled Studies (I − IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) \ninvolving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator \nduring the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM  was 5.7% for patients taking \nTrudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. \n \nAdverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN \nand CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very \ncommon ≥ 1/10; common≥ 1/100 < 1/10; uncommon≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare < 1/1000 in Table \n1 below.

trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions \n(erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving \nplacebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the \nmedicinal product.  \n\nInfections  \n\nIn the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated \npatients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections \nconsisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most \npatients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which \noccurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and \nextra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, \npneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis \noccurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of \nlatent disease. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nDuring the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) \nin patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing \nspondylitis and Crohn’s disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among \n2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 \ncontrol patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for control-\ntreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, \n12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years \namong control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% \nconfidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per \n1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 \n(0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patient-\nyears among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label \nextension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over \n13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, \nthe reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and \nlymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\nAutoantibodies  \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nStudies I − V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres \nat week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.

In patients with early \nrheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more \ncommon in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy \narm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients \n(Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. \n \nIn all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were \ntransient and resolved on continued treatment. \n \nCrohn’s disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients \nreceiving adalimumab or placebo. \n\nAdditional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials \n\nThe additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or \nPhase IV clinical trials: \n \n\nTable 2 \nUndesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies \n\n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \nHepatobiliary Disorders reactivation of hepatitis B \nNervous system disorders demyelinating disorders (e.g. optic neuritis) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary \n\nfibrosis  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders cutaneous vasculitis \nImmune system disorders anaphylaxis \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10-10 M).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n34 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\nAfter treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn’s disease. \n\nClinical trials \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients \nwere treated for up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of \nrheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies.   \n \nStudy I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nStudy II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nStudy III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-\nintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week.  \nThere were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks.  \nThe second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of \nTrudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 \nmonths. \n \nStudy IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa \nor placebo every other week for 24 weeks.   \n \nStudy V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of \nTrudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of \nprogression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. \n \nThe primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent \nof patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V \nwas the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.

In Study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  In addition, ACR response rates were \nmaintained in the majority of patients followed in the open-label extension phase to week 104.  There \nwere 114 out of 207 patients who continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 60 months.  \nAmong those, 86, 72, and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively at month 60. \n \nIn Study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Trudexa plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n \nIn Studies I-IV, Trudexa-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn Study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Trudexa and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see Table 4). \n \n\nTable 4:  ACR Responses in Study V \n(percent of patients) \n\n \n\nResponse MTX n=257 \nTrudexa \n\nn=274 \n\nTrudexa/MT\nX \n\nn=268 \np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20       \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n36 \n\n Week 52 62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n Week 104 56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \nACR 50       \n Week 52 45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n Week 104 42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \nACR 70       \n Week 52 27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n Week 104 28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \n\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nAt week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy \nand 23.4% of patients receiving Trudexa monotherapy.  Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy \nwas clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy \n(p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe \nrheumatoid arthritis.  The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). \n\nRadiographic response \n\nIn Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing \nscore.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than \npatients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label \nextension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained   \nfor 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every \nother week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. \n \n\nTable 5:  Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in Study III \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXa \n\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n(95% Confidence \n\nIntervalb) \n\nP-value \n\nTotal Sharp score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8)  < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Trudexa.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn Study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified total Sharp score (see Table 6). \n \n\nTable 6:  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in Study V \n \n\n \nMTX \nn=257 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa \nn=274 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa/MT\nX \n\nn=268 \np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n37 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTotal Sharp \nscore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001 \nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and methotrexate \nmonotherapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression \n(change from baseline in modified total Sharp score ≤ 0.5) was significantly higher with \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate \nmonotherapy (37.4% and 33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 \nand 44.5%, p < 0.001 respectively). \n\nQuality of life and physical function  \n\nHealth-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa \nin all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the \nHAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52.  \nResults from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four \nstudies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) \nscores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other \nweek dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of \nchronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies \nI, III, IV). \n \nIn Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of \nopen-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and \nimprovement was maintained through that time. \n \nIn Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic \narthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, \ntreated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \ntherapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.  Study VII with 12-week duration, \ntreated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Trudexa in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like \npsoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied (see Table 7). \n \n\nTable 7:  ACR Response in Placebo-Controlled Psoriatic Arthritis Studies \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n \n Study VI Study VII \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n38 \n\nResponse Placebo N=162 \nTrudexa \nN=151 \n\nPlacebo  \nN=49 \n\nTrudexa \nN=51 \n\nACR 20      \n Week 12 14% 58%*** 16% 39%* \n Week 24 15% 57%*** N/A N/A \nACR 50      \n Week 12 4% 36%*** 2% 25%*** \n Week 24 6% 39%*** N/A N/A \nACR 70      \n Week 12 1% 20%*** 0% 14% * \n Week 24 1% 23%*** N/A N/A \n\n*** p < 0.001 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo \n* p < 0.05 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo   \nN/A  not applicable \n\n \nACR responses in Study VI were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. \nTrudexa treated patients demonstrated improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and \nShort Form Health Survey (SF 36), from base-line to week 24. \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \n\nTrudexa 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week \ndouble − blind, placebo − controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean \nbaseline score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] \nwas 6.3 in all groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  Seventy-nine \n(20.1%) patients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti − rheumatic drugs, and 37 \n(9.4%) patients with glucocorticoids.  The blinded period was followed by an open − label period \nduring which patients received Trudexa 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an \nadditional 28 weeks.  Subjects (n=215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at Weeks 12, or 16 or \n20 received early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were \nsubsequently treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger study (VIII) with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with Trudexa compared to placebo.  \nSignificant response was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (Table 8).  \n\n \nTable 8 - Efficacy Responses in Placebo-Controlled AS Study – Study VIII \n\nReduction of Signs and Symptoms \n \n\nResponse Placebo \nN=107 \n\nTrudexa \nN=208 \n\nASASa 20   \n             Week 2 16% 42%*** \n\nWeek 12 21% 58%*** \nWeek 24 19% 51%*** \n\nASAS 50   \n             Week 2 3% 16%*** \n\nWeek 12 10% 38%*** \nWeek 24 11% 35%*** \n\nASAS 70   \n             Week 2 0% 7%** \n\nWeek 12 5% 23%*** \nWeek 24 8% 24%*** \n\n   \nBASDAIb 50    \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n39 \n\n             Week 2 4% 20%*** \nWeek 12  16% 45%*** \nWeek 24  15% 42%*** \n\n***,** Statistically significant at p < 0.001, < 0.01 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo at Weeks \n2, 12 and  24 \na ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis \nb Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \n\n \nTrudexa treated patients had significantly greater improvement at Week 12 which was maintained \nthrough Week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire \n(ASQoL). \n \nSimilar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double − blind, \nplacebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nCrohn’s Disease \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a \nsevere disease (CDAI score > 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) \ncorresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses \nof aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of \npatients continued to receive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and \nGAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment \ngroups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 \nand 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost \nresponse or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from \nthe studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received \nopen-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every \nother week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical \nresponse (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in \nclinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8.  \n \nCLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n40 \n\nTable 9: Induction of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CLASSIC I: Infliximab Naive Patients GAIN: Infliximab Experienced Patients \n\n Placebo \n\nN=74 \n\nTrudexa \n\n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 m\ng N=76 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=166 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Trudexa versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis.

These results suggest that some \npatients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week \n12.  Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section \n4.2).   \n\nQuality of Life \n\nIn CLASSIC I and GAIN, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n41 \n\nTrudexa 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CHARM \nas well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n\nImmunogenicity   \n\nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand adverse events. \n \nPatients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during \nthe 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 \n(5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as \nadd-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) \ntreated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% \n(24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to \nmethotrexate. \n \nIn patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated \nwith adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), \ncompared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) \ntreated with adalimumab. \n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-\nlife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The \nserum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following \n20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/ml were observed \nin Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe with needleguard. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate. \n\n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate. \n\n \nTrudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n \nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nTrudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease, in patients who have not \nresponded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \nFor induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with corticosteroids.  Trudexa can be \ngiven as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with \ncorticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n45 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n\nTrudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn’s \ndisease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\nAdults \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Trudexa. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an \nincrease in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \n\nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is \n40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn’s disease is \n80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to \ntherapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as \ntwo injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness \nthat the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, \nTrudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re administration after more than 8 \nweeks since the previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose \nintensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n46 \n\nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required.   \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no experience in children. \n\nImpaired renal and/or hepatic function \n\nTrudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section \n4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use   \n\nInfections \n \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after \ntreatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, \nmonitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalized infections until infections are controlled.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored \nclosely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious \ninfection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use \nof Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may \npredispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have \nbeen reported with Trudexa.   \n \nSerious infections: \n \nIn clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, \nand reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are \ninfections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia.   \n \nTuberculosis: \n \nThere have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the \nmajority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n47 \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a \npersonal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is \nrecommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers \nare reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are \nseverely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local \nrecommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the \nbenefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after \ntherapy with Trudexa.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections: \n \nThere have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa \ntherapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and \naspergillosis. \n \nIf a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general \ndeterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. \n \nHepatitis B Reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV \ninfection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy.  \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n\nNeurological events  \n\nTNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should \nexercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central \nnervous system demyelinating disorders.  \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa \nduring clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during \nclinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported \nvery rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic \nreaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate \ntherapy initiated.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n48 \n\nThe needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \nreactions in patients sensitive to latex. \n\nImmunosuppression \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and \nneutrophils. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background \nlymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory \ndisease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the \ndevelopment of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution \nshould be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients.  \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking \nagents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should \nbe advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of \nblood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation \nof Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \nabnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent \nvaccinations, except for live vaccines. \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in \npatients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe \nheart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop \nnew or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n49 \n\nAutoimmune processes \n\nTreatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies.  The impact of long-\nterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient \ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is \npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be \ngiven (see section 4.8). \n\nConcurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. \n\nSurgery \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long \nhalf-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A \npatient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving Trudexa.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\nTrudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as \nmonotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when \nTrudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy.  \nAdministration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, \nincreased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation  \n\nFor Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of \nadalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during \npregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception \nto prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n\nUse during lactation  \n\nIt is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion.  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n50 \n\nHowever, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at \nleast five months after the last Trudexa treatment. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nClinical Trials \n \nTrudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These \ntrials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as \npsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based \non the controlled Studies (I − IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) \ninvolving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator \nduring the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM  was 5.7% for patients taking \nTrudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. \n \nAdverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN \nand CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very \ncommon ≥ 1/10; common≥ 1/100 < 1/10; uncommon≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare < 1/1000 in Table \n1 below.

trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions \n(erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving \nplacebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the \nmedicinal product.  \n\nInfections  \n\nIn the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated \npatients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections \nconsisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most \npatients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which \noccurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and \nextra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, \npneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis \noccurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of \nlatent disease. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nDuring the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) \nin patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing \nspondylitis and Crohn’s disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among \n2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 \ncontrol patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for control-\ntreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, \n12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years \namong control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% \nconfidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per \n1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 \n(0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patient-\nyears among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label \nextension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over \n13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, \nthe reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and \nlymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\nAutoantibodies  \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nStudies I − V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres \nat week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.

No patients developed lupus nephritis or central \nnervous system symptoms. \n\nLiver Enzyme Elevations \n\nRheumatoid arthritis clinical trials: in controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (Studies I − IV), \nelevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo.  In patients with early \nrheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more \ncommon in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy \narm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients \n(Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. \n \nIn all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were \ntransient and resolved on continued treatment. \n \nCrohn’s disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients \nreceiving adalimumab or placebo. \n\nAdditional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials \n\nThe additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or \nPhase IV clinical trials: \n \n\nTable 2 \nUndesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies \n\n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \nHepatobiliary Disorders reactivation of hepatitis B \nNervous system disorders demyelinating disorders (e.g. optic neuritis) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary \n\nfibrosis  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders cutaneous vasculitis \nImmune system disorders anaphylaxis \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10-10 M).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n55 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\nAfter treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn’s disease. \n\nClinical trials \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients \nwere treated for up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of \nrheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies.   \n \nStudy I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nStudy II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nStudy III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-\nintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week.  \nThere were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks.  \nThe second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of \nTrudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 \nmonths. \n \nStudy IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa \nor placebo every other week for 24 weeks.   \n \nStudy V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of \nTrudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of \nprogression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. \n \nThe primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent \nof patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V \nwas the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.

Study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n\nACR response \n\nThe percent of Trudexa-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across \ntrials I, II and III.  The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 3.  \n \n\nTable 3:  ACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n \nResponse Study Ia** Study IIa** Study IIIa** \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXc \nn=60 \n\nTrudexab/ MTXc\nn=63 \n\nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nTrudexab \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nn=200 \n\nTrudexab/ \nMTXc \nn=207 \n\nACR 20       \n 6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3% \n 12 months NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9% \nACR 50       \n 6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1% \n 12 months NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5% \nACR 70       \n 6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8% \n 12 months NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2% \na Study I at 24 weeks, Study II at 26 weeks , and Study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg Trudexa administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, Trudexa versus placebo \n\n \nIn Studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores \nand CRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo.  In Study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  In addition, ACR response rates were \nmaintained in the majority of patients followed in the open-label extension phase to week 104.  There \nwere 114 out of 207 patients who continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 60 months.  \nAmong those, 86, 72, and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively at month 60. \n \nIn Study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Trudexa plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n \nIn Studies I-IV, Trudexa-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn Study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Trudexa and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see Table 4). \n \n\nTable 4:  ACR Responses in Study V \n(percent of patients) \n\n \n\nResponse MTX n=257 \nTrudexa \n\nn=274 \n\nTrudexa/MT\nX \n\nn=268 \np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20       \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n57 \n\n Week 52 62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n Week 104 56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \nACR 50       \n Week 52 45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n Week 104 42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \nACR 70       \n Week 52 27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n Week 104 28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \n\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nAt week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy \nand 23.4% of patients receiving Trudexa monotherapy.  Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy \nwas clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy \n(p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe \nrheumatoid arthritis.  The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). \n\nRadiographic response \n\nIn Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing \nscore.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than \npatients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label \nextension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained  \nfor 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every \nother week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. \n. \n\nTable 5:  Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in Study III \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXa \n\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n(95% Confidence \n\nIntervalb) \n\nP-value \n\nTotal Sharp score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8)  < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Trudexa.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn Study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified total Sharp score (see Table 6). \n \n\nTable 6:  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in Study V \n \n\n \nMTX \nn=257 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa \nn=274 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa/MT\nX \n\nn=268 \np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n58 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTotal Sharp \nscore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001 \nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and methotrexate \nmonotherapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression \n(change from baseline in modified total Sharp score ≤ 0.5) was significantly higher with \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate \nmonotherapy (37.4% and 33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 \nand 44.5%, p < 0.001 respectively). \n\nQuality of life and physical function  \n\nHealth-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa \nin all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the \nHAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52.  \nResults from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four \nstudies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) \nscores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other \nweek dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of \nchronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies \nI, III, IV). \n \nIn Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of \nopen-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and \nimprovement was maintained through that time. \n \nIn Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic \narthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.

Concomitant stable doses \nof aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of \npatients continued to receive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and \nGAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment \ngroups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 \nand 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost \nresponse or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from \nthe studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received \nopen-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every \nother week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical \nresponse (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in \nclinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8.  \n \nCLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n61 \n\nTable 9: Induction of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CLASSIC I: Infliximab Naive Patients GAIN: Infliximab Experienced Patients \n\n Placebo \n\nN=74 \n\nTrudexa \n\n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 m\ng N=76 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=166 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Trudexa versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis.  Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other \nanti-TNF therapy.  Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 10.

Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section \n4.2).   \n\nQuality of Life \n\nIn CLASSIC I and GAIN, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n62 \n\nTrudexa 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CHARM \nas well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n\nImmunogenicity   \n\nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand adverse events. \n \nPatients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during \nthe 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 \n(5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as \nadd-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) \ntreated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% \n(24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to \nmethotrexate. \n \nIn patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated \nwith adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), \ncompared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) \ntreated with adalimumab. \n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-\nlife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The \nserum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following \n20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/ml were observed \nin Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.

Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic \nor renal impairment. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate \nmodels for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of \nneutralizing antibodies in rodents.  \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate. \n \n\n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate. \n\n \nTrudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n \nTrudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nTrudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease, in patients who have not \nresponded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n66 \n\nFor induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with corticosteroids.  Trudexa can be \ngiven as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with \ncorticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2). \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n\nTrudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn’s \ndisease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\nAdults \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Trudexa. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an \nincrease in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \n\nThe recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is \n40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \nresponding within this time period. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn’s disease is \n80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to \ntherapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as \ntwo injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness \nthat the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, \nTrudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 \nweeks since the previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n67 \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose \nintensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required.   \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n There is no experience in children. \n\nImpaired renal and/or hepatic function \n\nTrudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section \n4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use   \n\nInfections \n \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after \ntreatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, \nmonitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalized infections until infections are controlled.  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored \nclosely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious \ninfection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use \nof Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may \npredispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have \nbeen reported with Trudexa.   \n \nSerious infections: \n \nIn clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, \nand reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are \ninfections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia.   \n \nTuberculosis: \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n68 \n\nThere have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the \nmajority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a \npersonal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is \nrecommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers \nare reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are \nseverely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local \nrecommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the \nbenefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after \ntherapy with Trudexa.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections: \n \nThere have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa \ntherapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and \naspergillosis. \n \nIf a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general \ndeterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. \n \nHepatitis B Reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV \ninfection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy.  \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n\nNeurological events  \n\nTNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should \nexercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central \nnervous system demyelinating disorders.  \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa \nduring clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during \nclinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported \nvery rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n69 \n\nreaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate \ntherapy initiated.  \n \nThe needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \nreactions in patients sensitive to latex. \n\nImmunosuppression \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and \nneutrophils. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background \nlymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory \ndisease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the \ndevelopment of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution \nshould be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients.  \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking \nagents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should \nbe advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of \nblood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation \nof Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \nabnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent \nvaccinations, except for live vaccines. \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in \npatients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n70 \n\nheart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop \nnew or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\nAutoimmune processes \n\nTreatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies.  The impact of long-\nterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient \ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is \npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be \ngiven (see section 4.8). \n\nConcurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. \n\nSurgery \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long \nhalf-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A \npatient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving Trudexa.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\nTrudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as \nmonotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when \nTrudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy.  \nAdministration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, \nincreased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation  \n\nFor Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of \nadalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during \npregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception \nto prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n\nUse during lactation  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n71 \n\nIt is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion.  \n \nHowever, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at \nleast five months after the last Trudexa treatment. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nClinical Trials \n \nTrudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These \ntrials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as \npsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based \non the controlled Studies (I − IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) \ninvolving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator \nduring the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM  was 5.7% for patients taking \nTrudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. \n \nAdverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I − IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN \nand CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very \ncommon ≥ 1/10; common≥ 1/100 < 1/10; uncommon≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare < 1/1000 in Table \n1 below.

controlled trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions \n(erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving \nplacebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the \nmedicinal product.  \n\nInfections  \n\nIn the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated \npatients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections \nconsisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most \npatients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which \noccurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and \nextra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, \npneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis \noccurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of \nlatent disease. \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\nDuring the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) \nin patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing \nspondylitis and Crohn’s disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among \n2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 \ncontrol patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for control-\ntreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, \n12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years \namong control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% \nconfidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per \n1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 \n(0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patient-\nyears among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label \nextension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over \n13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, \nthe reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and \nlymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\nAutoantibodies  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n75 \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nStudies I − V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres \nat week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.  The patients \nimproved following discontinuation of therapy.  No patients developed lupus nephritis or central \nnervous system symptoms. \n\nLiver Enzyme Elevations \n\nRheumatoid arthritis clinical trials: in controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (Studies I − IV), \nelevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo.  In patients with early \nrheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more \ncommon in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy \narm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients \n(Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. \n \nIn all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were \ntransient and resolved on continued treatment. \n \nCrohn’s disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients \nreceiving adalimumab or placebo. \n\nAdditional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials \n\nThe additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or \nPhase IV clinical trials: \n \n\nTable 2 \nUndesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies \n\n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \nHepatobiliary Disorders reactivation of hepatitis B \nNervous system disorders demyelinating disorders (e.g. optic neuritis) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary \n\nfibrosis  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders cutaneous vasculitis \nImmune system disorders anaphylaxis \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.

Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn’s disease. \n\nClinical trials \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTrudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients \nwere treated for up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of \nrheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies.   \n \nStudy I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nStudy II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  \nNo other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nStudy III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 \nyears old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-\nintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week.  \nThere were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks.  \nThe second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of \nTrudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 \nmonths. \n \nStudy IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, \nanti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that \ntherapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa \nor placebo every other week for 24 weeks.   \n \nStudy V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).

Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than \npatients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label \nextension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained \nfor 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every \nother week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. \n \n\nTable 5:  Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in Study III \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXa \n\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nTRUDEXA/MTX \n(95% Confidence \n\nIntervalb) \n\nP-value \n\nTotal Sharp score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8)  < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Trudexa.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n79 \n\nIn Study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified total Sharp score (see Table 6). \n \n\nTable 6:  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in Study V \n \n\n \nMTX \nn=257 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa \nn=274 \n\n(95% confidence \ninterval) \n\nTrudexa/MT\nX \n\nn=268 \n(95% confidence \n\ninterval) \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nTotal Sharp \nscore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001 \nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and Trudexa/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Trudexa monotherapy and methotrexate \nmonotherapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression \n(change from baseline in modified total Sharp score ≤ 0.5) was significantly higher with \nTrudexa/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate \nmonotherapy (37.4% and 33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 \nand 44.5%, p < 0.001 respectively). \n\nQuality of life and physical function  \n\nHealth-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa \nin all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the \nHAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52.  \nResults from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four \nstudies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) \nscores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other \nweek dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of \nchronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies \nI, III, IV). \n \nIn Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of \nopen-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and \nimprovement was maintained through that time. \n \nIn Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nTrudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic \narthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, \ntreated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \ntherapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.

Seventy-nine \n(20.1%) patients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti − rheumatic drugs, and 37 \n(9.4%) patients with glucocorticoids.  The blinded period was followed by an open − label period \nduring which patients received Trudexa 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an \nadditional 28 weeks.  Subjects (n=215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at Weeks 12, or 16 or \n20 received early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were \nsubsequently treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger study (VIII) with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with Trudexa compared to placebo.  \nSignificant response was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (Table 8).  \n\n \nTable 8 - Efficacy Responses in Placebo-Controlled AS Study – Study VIII \n\nReduction of Signs and Symptoms \n \n\nResponse Placebo \nN=107 \n\nTrudexa \nN=208 \n\nASASa 20   \n             Week 2 16% 42%*** \n\nWeek 12 21% 58%*** \nWeek 24 19% 51%*** \n\nASAS 50   \n             Week 2 3% 16%*** \n\nWeek 12 10% 38%*** \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n81 \n\nWeek 24 11% 35%*** \nASAS 70   \n             Week 2 0% 7%** \n\nWeek 12 5% 23%*** \nWeek 24 8% 24%*** \n\n   \nBASDAIb 50    \n             Week 2 4% 20%*** \n\nWeek 12  16% 45%*** \nWeek 24  15% 42%*** \n\n***,** Statistically significant at p < 0.001, < 0.01 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo at Weeks \n2, 12 and  24 \na ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis \nb Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \n\n \nTrudexa treated patients had significantly greater improvement at Week 12 which was maintained \nthrough Week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire \n(ASQoL). \n \nSimilar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double − blind, \nplacebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nCrohn’s Disease \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a \nsevere disease (CDAI score > 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) \ncorresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses \nof aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of \npatients continued to receive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and \nGAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment \ngroups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 \nand 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost \nresponse or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from \nthe studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received \nopen-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every \nother week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical \nresponse (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in \nclinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8.  \n \nCLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n82 \n\nTable 9: Induction of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CLASSIC I: Infliximab Naive Patients GAIN: Infliximab Experienced Patients \n\n Placebo \n\nN=74 \n\nTrudexa \n\n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 m\ng N=76 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=166 \n\nTrudexa  \n\n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Trudexa versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis.

Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section \n4.2).   \n\nQuality of Life \n\nIn CLASSIC I and GAIN, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n83 \n\nTrudexa 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CHARM \nas well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n\nImmunogenicity   \n\nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand adverse events. \n \nPatients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during \nthe 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 \n(5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as \nadd-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) \ntreated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% \n(24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to \nmethotrexate. \n \nIn patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated \nwith adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), \ncompared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) \ntreated with adalimumab. \n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-\nlife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The \nserum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following \n20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nTrudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg/ml \nduring the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/ml were observed \nin Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.

Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic \nor renal impairment. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate \nmodels for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of \nneutralizing antibodies in rodents.  \n\n6.

WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\nTrudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.  \nIt is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, \nadalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein \n(tumour necrosis factor or TNFα), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such \nas rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate.  \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.   \n \nTrudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the \ndisease and to improve physical function.  \n \nUsually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n122 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis \nyou will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you \nwill be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn’s disease you will \nfirst be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA \n\nDo not use Trudexa:  \n\n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa.  \n \n• If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Take special care with \n\nTrudexa”).  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n• If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \n\nor have a serious heart condition (see “Take special care with Trudexa”). \n\nTake special care with Trudexa:  \n\n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \nrash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \n\nreactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be \nadvised to avoid touching the inner shield. \n\n \n• If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor.  \n \n• You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including \n\nserious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be \nlife-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems.  \n\n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a \nthorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should \nbe recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \ntuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \n• Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n123 \n\nHBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other \nmedicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \n• If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking Trudexa. \n \n• If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. \n \n• Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor \n\nbefore you receive any vaccines. \n \n• If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa, your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.   \n\n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other \n\nTNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a \nlong time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare \ncases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. \n\n \n• Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \nblocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nTrudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have \nquestions, please ask your doctor. \n \nUsing Trudexa with food and drink \n \nSince Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nThe effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant \nwomen is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate \ncontraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nIt is not known whether adalimumab passes into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n124 \n\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother, you should stop breast-feeding during Trudexa treatment and for at \nleast 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTrudexa should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Trudexa \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n\n3. HOW TO USE TRUDEXA \n\nAlways take Trudexa exactly as your doctor has told you.  You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nTrudexa is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use).  The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab given every other week as \na single dose.  The usual dose regimen for Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 and followed by 40 mg \nevery other week starting at week 2.  In cases where a more rapid response is required your doctor \nmay prescribe a dose of 160 mg at week 0 (as 4 injections in one day or 2 injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), 80 mg (2 injections) at week 2, and thereafter as 40 mg (1 injection) every other \nweek.  Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose to 40 mg every week.  You \nshould continue to inject Trudexa for as long as your doctor has told you.   \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Trudexa.  If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Trudexa therapy, your \ndoctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week.  \n\nInstructions for preparing and giving an injection of Trudexa: \n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject Trudexa.  Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step.  You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on the technique \nof self-injection.  Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare \nand give the injection.  After proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by \nanother person, for example a family member or friend. \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. \n\n1)  Setting up  \n\n• Wash your hands thoroughly  \n• Set up the following items on a clean surface \n\n \no One vial of Trudexa for injection \no One syringe with fixed needle \no Two alcohol pads \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n125 \n\n   \n\n \n• Look at the expiry date on the vial.  Do not use the product after the month and year shown. \n\n2)  Choosing and preparing an injection site  \n\n• Choose a site on your thigh or stomach \n \n \n\n \n \n• Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site.  \n\no Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  This may mean \nthere is an infection. \n\no Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion. \no Do not touch the area again before injecting. \n\n3)  Injecting Trudexa  \n\nPreparing the Trudexa dose for injection \n• Do NOT shake the vial.  \n• Remove the plastic cap from the Trudexa vial.  Do NOT remove the grey stopper or aluminium \n\nring around the top of the vial. \n• Use a new alcohol pad to clean the grey stopper on the vial.  After cleaning, do not touch the \n\nstopper with your hands. \n• Remove cap from needle syringe, being careful not to touch needle or let it touch any surface. \n• Make sure that the plunger is fully inserted into the syringe.  With the vial upright on a flat \n\nsurface, such as a table, insert the needle straight through the centre ring of the grey stopper.  If \nthe needle is correctly lined up, you should feel a slight resistance and then a “pop” as the \nneedle goes through the centre of the stopper.  Look for the needle tip inside the stopper \nwindow.  If the needle is not correctly lined up with the centre of the stopper, you will feel \nconstant resistance as it goes through the stopper and no “pop.”  The needle may then enter at an \nangle and bend, break or prevent proper removal of the vial contents.  If this happens, do not \nuse the syringe or vial. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n126 \n\n• With the needle still in the vial, turn the vial upside down at eye level.  Check that the needle is \nbelow the surface of the solution.  Slowly pull the plunger back to draw solution into the \nsyringe.   \n\n• With the needle still inserted in the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles.  Gently tap the \nsyringe to make any bubbles rise to the top of the syringe near the needle.  Slowly press the \nplunger to push the bubbles out of the syringe and into the vial.  When you do this, if you \naccidentally push some solution back into the vial, pull slowly back in the plunger to draw the \nentire contents of the vial back into the syringe. \n\n• Pull the needle completely out of the vial.  Again, do NOT touch the needle or let it touch any \nsurface. \n\n \nInjecting Trudexa \n• With one hand, gently grasp the cleaned areas of skin and hold firmly  \n• With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin, with the grooved side up. \n \n \n\n• With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin \n• Release the skin with the first hand \n• Push plunger to inject solution – it can take from 2 to 5 seconds to empty the syringe \n• When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to keep it at the same \n\nangle as when it was inserted \n• Using your thumb or a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds.  A \n\nlittle bleeding may occur.  Do not rub the injection site.  Use a plaster if you want to.  \n\n4)  Throwing away supplies \n\n• The Trudexa syringe should NEVER be reused.  NEVER recap a needle \n• After injecting Trudexa, immediately throw away the used syringe in a special container as \n\ninstructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• Keep this container out of the reach and sight of children \n\nIf you use more Trudexa than you should: \n\nIf you accidentally inject Trudexa more frequently than told to by your doctor, you should call your \ndoctor and tell him/her that you have taken more.  Always take the outer carton or the vial of medicine \nwith you, even if it is empty.  \n\nIf you forget to take Trudexa: \n\nIf you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Trudexa as soon as you \nremember.  Then take your next dose as you would have on your originally scheduled day, had you \nnot forgotten a dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n127 \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\nLike all medicines, Trudexa can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Most side \neffects are mild to moderate.  However, some may be serious and require treatment.

You may need to read it again. \n− Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before you are given Trudexa and during treatment \nwith Trudexa.  Keep this Patient Alert Card together with the package leaflet.  \n\n− If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n− This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n− If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1.

WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\nTrudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.  \nIt is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, \nadalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein \n(tumour necrosis factor or TNFα), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such \nas rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate.  \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.   \n \nTrudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the \ndisease and to improve physical function. \n \nUsually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n133 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis \nyou will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you \nwill be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn’s disease you will \nfirst be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA \n\nDo not use Trudexa:  \n\n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa. \n \n• If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Take special care with \n\nTrudexa”).  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n• If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \n\nor have a serious heart condition (see “Take special care with Trudexa”). \n\nTake special care with Trudexa:  \n\n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \nrash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \n• The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \n\nreactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be \nadvised to avoid touching the inner shield. \n\n \n• If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor.  \n \n• You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including \n\nserious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be \nlife-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a \nthorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should \nbe recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \ntuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.  \n\n \n• Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \n• Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n134 \n\nHBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other \nmedicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \n• If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking Trudexa. \n \n• If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. \n \n• Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor \n\nbefore you receive any vaccines. \n \n• If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa, your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other \n\nTNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a \nlong time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare \ncases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. \n\n \n• Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \nblocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nTrudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have \nquestions, please ask your doctor. \n \nUsing Trudexa with food and drink \n \nSince Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nThe effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant \nwomen is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate \ncontraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nIt is not known whether adalimumab passes into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n135 \n\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother, you should stop breast-feeding during Trudexa treatment and for at \nleast 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTrudexa should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Trudexa \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n\n3. HOW TO USE TRUDEXA \n\nAlways take Trudexa exactly as your doctor has told you.  You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nTrudexa is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use).  The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab given every other week as \na single dose.  The usual dose regimen for Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 and followed by 40 mg \nevery other week starting at week 2.  In cases where a more rapid response is required your doctor \nmay prescribe a dose of 160 mg at week 0 (as 4 injections in one day or 2 injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), 80 mg (2 injections) at week 2, and thereafter as 40 mg (1 injection) every other \nweek.  Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose to 40 mg every week.  You \nshould continue to inject Trudexa for as long as your doctor has told you.   \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Trudexa.  If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone.  \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Trudexa therapy, your \ndoctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week.  \n\nInstructions for preparing and giving an injection of Trudexa: \n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject Trudexa.  Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step.  You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on the technique \nof self-injection.  Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare \nand give the injection.  After proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by \nanother person, for example a family member or friend.   \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. \n\n1)  Setting up \n\n• Wash your hands thoroughly  \n• Set up the following items on a clean surface \n \n\no One pre-filled syringe of Trudexa for injection      \no One alcohol pad \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n136 \n\n \n\n \n \n• Look at the expiry date on the syringe.  Do not use the product after the month and year shown. \n\n2) Choosing and preparing an injection site  \n\n• Choose a site on your thigh or stomach \n \n\n \n \n• Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site.  \n\no Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  This may mean \nthere is an infection. \n\no Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion. \no Do not touch the area again before injecting. \n\n3)  Injecting Trudexa  \n\n• Do NOT shake the syringe. \n• Remove cap from needle syringe, being careful not to touch the needle or let it touch any \n\nsurface. \n• With one hand, gently grasp the cleaned areas of skin and hold firmly \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n137 \n\n \n• With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin, with the grooved side up. \n• With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin \n• Release the skin with the first hand \n• Push plunger to inject solution – it can take from 2 to 5 seconds to empty the syringe \n• When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to keep it at the same \n\nangle as when it was inserted \n• Using your thumb or a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds.  A \n\nlittle bleeding may occur.  Do not rub the injection site.  Use a plaster if you want to. \n\n4)  Throwing away supplies \n\n• The Trudexa syringe should NEVER be reused.  NEVER recap a needle. \n• After injecting Trudexa, immediately throw away the used syringe in a special container as \n\ninstructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• Keep this container out of the reach and sight of children \n\nIf you use more Trudexa than you should: \n\nIf you accidentally inject Trudexa more frequently than told to by your doctor, you should call your \ndoctor and tell him/her that you have taken more.  Always take the outer carton of medicine with you, \neven if it is empty.  \n\nIf you forget to take Trudexa: \n\nIf you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Trudexa as soon as you \nremember.  Then take your next dose as you would have on your originally scheduled day, had you \nnot forgotten a dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\nLike all medicines, Trudexa can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Most side \neffects are mild to moderate.  However, some may be serious and require treatment.  Side effects may \noccur at least up to 5 months after the last treatment.   \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following:  \n• Severe rash, hives or other signs of allergic reaction;  \n• Swollen face, hands, feet; \n• Trouble breathing, swallowing; \n• Shortness of breath with exertion or upon lying down or swelling of the feet; \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n138 \n\n• Signs and symptoms suggestive of blood disorders such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, \npaleness. \n\n \nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following:  \n• Signs of infection such as fever, malaise, wounds, dental problems, burning on urination; \n• Feeling weak or tired; \n• Coughing; \n• Tinglings; \n• Numbness; \n• Double vision; \n• Arm or leg weakness. \n \nThe symptoms described above can be signs of the below listed side effects, which have been \nobserved with Trudexa: \n \nVery common (≥ 1/10 patients):   \n• injection site reactions (including pain, swelling, redness or itching). \n \nCommon (≥ 1/100 and < 1/10 patients):   \n• lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis, pneumonia); \n• upper respiratory tract infections (including cold, runny nose, sinus infection); \n• urinary tract infection, cold blisters, shingles; \n• dizziness, including vertigo, headache; \n• eye inflammation; \n• cough, sore throat; \n• nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, mouth ulcers; \n• elevated liver enzymes; \n• rash, itching, hair loss; \n• fatigue; \n• fever. \n \nUncommon (≥ 1/1000 and< 1/100 patients):  \n• serious infections (such as sepsis [blood poisoning]), joint infection, fungal infections; \n• skin wart; \n• anaemia, low white blood cell counts; \n• allergic reactions;  \n• increased lipid values, appetite disorders; \n• anxiety, depression, feeling sleepy and difficulty sleeping; \n• nerve disorders (such as multiple sclerosis and eye nerve inflammation), taste disturbances; \n• vision disturbances; \n• ear discomfort; \n• sensation of heart beating rapidly, high blood pressure; \n• asthma, shortness of breath; \n• abdominal symptoms (such as vomiting, indigestion, constipation), rectal bleeding; \n• skin disorders (such as psoriasis, eczema or infections), itchy rash, slow wound healing; \n• muscle weakness; \n• urinary disturbances (such as blood in urine, increased urinary frequency); \n• increased menstrual bleeding; \n• flu like symptoms, chest pain, swelling of the feet. \n \nRare (< 1/1000) \n• glaucoma; \n• skin cancer; \n• thyroid disorders; \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n139 \n\n• protein in urine. \n \nOther side effects that have been observed in patients taking Trudexa:  \ntuberculosis and other opportunistic infections (infections that occur when resistance to disease is \nlowered); \nlung disease. \n \nIf any side effects get serious, if you have any unusual effects, or if you notice any side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.  \n\n5.

You may need to read it again. \n− Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before you are given Trudexa and during treatment \nwith Trudexa.  Keep this Patient Alert Card with the package leaflet. \n\n− If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n− This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n− If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1.

WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\nTrudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.  \nIt is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, \nadalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein \n(tumour necrosis factor or TNFα), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such \nas rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate.  \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.   \n \nTrudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the \ndisease and to improve physical function. \n \nUsually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n143 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis \nyou will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you \nwill be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn’s disease you will \nfirst be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA \n\nDo not use Trudexa:  \n\n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa.  \n \n• If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Take special care with \n\nTrudexa”).  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n• If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \n\nor have a serious heart condition (see “Take special care with Trudexa”). \n\nTake special care with Trudexa:  \n\n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \nrash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \n\nreactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be \nadvised to avoid touching the inner shield. \n\n \n• If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor.  \n \n• You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including \n\nserious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare case, be \nlife-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems.  \n\n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a \nthorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should \nbe recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \ntuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \n• Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n144 \n\nHBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other \nmedicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \n• If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking Trudexa. \n \n• If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa \n \n• Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor \n\nbefore you receive any vaccines. \n \n• If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa, your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. \n\n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other \n\nTNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a \nlong time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare \ncases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. \n\n \n• Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \nblocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nTrudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have \nquestions, please ask your doctor. \n \nUsing Trudexa with food and drink \n \nSince Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nThe effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant \nwomen is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate \ncontraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nIt is not known whether adalimumab passes into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n145 \n\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother, advise you should stop breast-feeding during Trudexa treatment, \nand for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTrudexa should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Trudexa \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n\n3. HOW TO USE TRUDEXA \n\nAlways take Trudexa exactly as your doctor has told you.  You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nTrudexa is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use).  The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab given every other week as \na single dose.  The usual dose regimen for Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 and followed by 40 mg \nevery other week starting at week 2.  In cases where a more rapid response is required your doctor \nmay prescribe a dose of 160 mg at week 0 (as 4 injections in one day or 2 injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), 80 mg (2 injections) at week 2, and thereafter as 40 mg (1 injection) every other \nweek.  Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose to 40 mg every week.  You \nshould continue to inject Trudexa for as long as your doctor has told you.   \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Trudexa.  If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone.  \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Trudexa therapy, your \ndoctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week. \n \nInstructions for preparing and giving an injection of Trudexa: \nThe following instructions explain how to inject Trudexa.  Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step.  You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on the technique \nof self-injection.  Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare \nand give the injection.  After proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by \nanother person, for example a family member or friend. \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. \n\n1)  Setting up \n\n• Wash your hands thoroughly  \n• Set up the following items on a clean surface \n \n\no One pre-filled syringe of Trudexa for injection \no One alcohol pad \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n146 \n\n \n \n\n• Look at the expiry date on the syringe.  Do not use the product after the month and year shown. \n\n2)  Choosing and preparing an injection site  \n\n• Choose a site on your thigh or stomach \n\n \n \n \n• Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site.  \n\no Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  This may mean \nthere is an infection. \n\no Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion. \no Do not touch the area again before injecting. \n\n3)  Injecting Trudexa  \n\n• Do NOT shake the syringe. \n• Remove cap from needle syringe, being careful not to touch the needle or let it touch any \n\nsurface. \n• With one hand, gently grasp the cleaned areas of skin and hold firmly \n\n \n \n• With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin, with the grooved side up. \n• With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin \n• Release the skin with the first hand \n• Push plunger to inject solution – it can take from 2 to 5 seconds to empty the syringe \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n147 \n\n• When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to keep it at the same \nangle as when it was inserted \n\n• Hold the syringe in one hand and with the other hand slide the outer protective shield over the \nexposed needle until it locks in place \n\n• Using your thumb or a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds.  A \nlittle bleeding may occur.  Do not rub the injection site.  Use a plaster if you want to. \n\n4) Throwing away supplies \n\n• The Trudexa syringe should NEVER be reused.  NEVER recap a needle \n• After injecting Trudexa, immediately throw away the used syringe in a special container as \n\ninstructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• Keep this container out of the reach and sight of children \n\nIf you use more Trudexa than you should: \n\nIf you accidentally inject Trudexa more frequently than told to by your doctor, you should call your \ndoctor and tell him/her that you have taken more.  Always take the outer carton of medicine with you, \neven if it is empty.  \n\nIf you forget to take Trudexa: \n\nIf you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Trudexa as soon as you \nremember.  Then take your next dose as you would have on your originally scheduled day, had you \nnot forgotten a dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\nLike all medicines, Trudexa can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Most side \neffects are mild to moderate.  However, some may be serious and require treatment.

You may need to read it again. \n− Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before you are given Trudexa and during treatment \nwith Trudexa.  Keep this Patient Alert Card together with the package leaflet. \n\n− If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n− This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n− If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:    \n1. What Trudexa is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Trudexa \n3. How to use Trudexa \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Trudexa \n6. Further information \n\n1. WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\nTrudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.  \nIt is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, \nadalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein \n(tumour necrosis factor or TNFα), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such \nas rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate.  \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.   \n \nTrudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nTrudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the \ndisease and to improve physical function.  \n\nUsually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone.  \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n153 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis \nyou will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you \nwill be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn’s disease you will \nfirst be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA \n\nDo not use Trudexa:  \n\n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa.  \n \n• If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Take special care with \n\nTrudexa”).  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n• If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \n\nor have a serious heart condition (see “Take special care with Trudexa”). \n\nTake special care with Trudexa:  \n\n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \nrash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic \n\nreactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be \nadvised to avoid touching the inner shield. \n\n \n• If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor.  \n \n• You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including \n\nserious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be \nlife-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems.  \n\n \n• As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a \nthorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should \nbe recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \ntuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \n• Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n154 \n\nHBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other \nmedicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \n• If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking Trudexa. \n \n• If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. \n \n• Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor \n\nbefore you receive any vaccines. \n \n• If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa , your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. \n\n \n• In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n• There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other \n\nTNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a \nlong time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare \ncases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. \n\n \n• Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \nblocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nTrudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have \nquestions, please ask your doctor. \n \nUsing Trudexa with food and drink \n \nSince Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nThe effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant \nwomen is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate \ncontraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nIt is not known whether adalimumab passes into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n155 \n\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother, you should stop breast-feeding during Trudexa treatment and for at \nleast 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTrudexa should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Trudexa \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n\n3. HOW TO USE THE TRUDEXA PRE-FILLED PEN \n\nAlways use Trudexa exactly as your doctor has told you.  You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nTrudexa is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use).  The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab given every other week as \na single dose.  The usual dose regimen for Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 and followed by 40 mg \nevery other week starting at week 2. I n cases where a more rapid response is required your doctor \nmay prescribe a dose of 160 mg at week 0 (as 4 injections in one day or 2 injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), 80 mg (2 injections) at week 2, and thereafter as 40 mg (1 injection) every other \nweek.  Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose to 40 mg every week.  You \nshould continue to inject Trudexa for as long as your doctor has told you.   \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Trudexa.  If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Trudexa therapy, your \ndoctor may decide to give 40 mg Trudexa every week.  \n\nInjecting Trudexa yourself  \n\nThe following instructions explain how to give yourself an injection of Trudexa using the pre-filled \npen.  Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.  You will be instructed by \nyour doctor or his/her assistant on the technique of self-injection.  Do not attempt to self-inject until \nyou are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection.  After proper training, the \ninjection can be self-administered or given by another person, for example a family member or friend. \n\nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Trudexa? \n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly.  \n2.  Take one dose tray containing a pre-filled pen of Trudexa from the refrigerator.  \n3.  Do not shake or drop the pre-filled pen. \n4.  Set up the following items on a clean surface. \n \n\n• One pre-filled pen of Trudexa  \n• One alcohol pad \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n156 \n\n        \n \n \n\n5.  Check the expiry date on the pre-filled pen label (EXP:).  Do not use the product if the date has \npassed the month and year shown. \n\n \n6.  Hold the pre-filled pen with the grey cap (labelled ‘1’) pointing up.  Check the appearance of \n\nthe Trudexa solution through the windows on the sides of the pre-filled pen.  It must be clear \nand colourless.  If it is cloudy or discoloured or has flakes or particles in it, you must not use it.  \nDo not use a pre-filled pen that is frozen or if it has been left in direct sunlight.  \n\n \n\n           \n   \n\n   \n\nWhere should I give my injection?   \n\n1.  Choose a site on the top of your thigh or stomach (except the area around the navel). \n \n\n       \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n157 \n\n2.  Change the place that you inject each time so that you do not become sore in one area.  Each \nnew injection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site.  \n\n \n3.  Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  This may mean there is an \n\ninfection.   \n \n\nHow do I give my injection? \n \n1.  Wipe your skin by using the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion.  Do not touch the \n\narea again before injecting.     \n \n2. Hold the pre-filled pen with one hand with the grey cap (1) pointed down.  With your other \n\nhand, pull the grey cap (1) straight off and discard cap.  Check that the small grey needle cover \nof the syringe has been removed with the cap.  The white needle sleeve will now be exposed.  \nDo not try to touch the needle housed in the barrel.  DO NOT RECAP as you may damage the \nneedle inside.  \n\n \n3.  Pull the plum safety cap (labelled ‘2’) straight off to expose the plum coloured activation button \n\nat the top.  The pre-filled pen is now ready to use.  Do not press the plum activation button until \nproperly positioned as this will result in discharge of medication.  DO NOT RECAP as this \ncould cause the unit to discharge. \n\n \nGiving the injection \n\n \n1.  With your free hand, gently grasp a sizable area of the cleaned skin at the injection site and hold \n\nfirmly (see below).   \n2.   Place the white end of the pre-filled pen at a right angle (90 degrees) to the skin, so that you can \n\nsee the window.  \n3.  Holding the barrel of the pre-filled pen, press down slightly onto the injection site (holding in \n\nplace without moving).  \n4.  With your index finger or your thumb, press the plum coloured button on top once you are ready \n\nto begin the injection (see below).  You will then hear a ‘click’ as the needle is released, and you \nwill feel a small prick as the needle advances.  \n\n5.  Keep pressing and continue to hold the pre-filled pen with steady pressure in place for about 10 \nseconds to ensure a complete injection.  Do not remove the pre-filled pen while the injection is \nbeing given.  \n\n \n\n           \n \n            \n \n6.  You will see a yellow indicator move into the windows during the injection.  The injection is \n\ncomplete when the yellow indicator stops moving.   \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n158 \n\n7.  Lift the pre-filled pen straight up from the injection site.  The white needle sleeve will move \ndown over the needle and lock into place over the needle tip.  Do not try to touch the needle.  \nThe white needle sleeve is there to protect you from touching the needle.    \n\n \n\n         \n \n8.  You may notice a spot of blood at the injection site.  You can press a cotton ball or a piece of \n\ngauze over the injection site for 10 seconds.  Do not rub the injection site.  Use a plaster if you \nwant to. \n\nThrowing away supplies \n\n• Do not put either of the caps back on the pre-filled pen. \n• Put used pre-filled pen immediately into the special container as instructed by your doctor, \n\nnurse or pharmacist. \n• Keep this container out of the reach and sight of children. \n• Never put the pre-filled pens that you have used into your normal household rubbish bin. \n• Only use each pre-filled pen for one injection.   \n\nIf you use more Trudexa than you should: \n\nIf you accidentally inject Trudexa more frequently than told to by your doctor, you should call your \ndoctor and tell him/her that you have taken more.  Always take the outer carton or the pre-filled pen of \nmedicine with you, even if it is empty.  \n\nIf you forget to take Trudexa: \n\nIf you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Trudexa as soon as you \nremember.  Then take your next dose as you would have on your originally scheduled day, had you \nnot forgotten a dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\nLike all medicines, Trudexa can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Most side \neffects are mild to moderate.  However, some may be serious and require treatment.  Side effects may \noccur at least up to 5 months after the last treatment.   \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following:  \n• Severe rash, hives or other signs of allergic reaction;  \n• Swollen face, hands, feet; \n• Trouble breathing, swallowing; \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n159 \n\n• Shortness of breath with exertion or upon lying down or swelling of the feet; \n• Signs and symptoms suggestive of blood disorders such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, \n\npaleness. \n \nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following:  \n• Signs of infection such as fever, malaise, wounds, dental problems, burning on urination; \n• Feeling weak or tired; \n• Coughing; \n• Tingling; \n• Numbness; \n• Double vision; \n• Arm or leg weakness. \n \nThe symptoms described above can be signs of the below listed side effects, which have been \nobserved with Trudexa: \n \nVery common (≥ 1/10 patients):   \n• injection site reactions (including pain, swelling, redness or itching). \n \nCommon (≥ 1/100 and < 1/10 patients):   \n• lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis, pneumonia);  \n• upper respiratory tract infections (including cold, runny nose, sinus infection); \n• urinary tract infection, cold blisters, shingles; \n• dizziness, including vertigo, headache; \n• eye inflammation; \n• cough, sore throat; \n• nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, mouth ulcers; \n• elevated liver enzymes; \n• rash, itching, hair loss; \n• fatigue; \n• fever. \n \nUncommon (≥ 1/1000 and< 1/100 patients):   \n• serious infections (such as sepsis [blood poisoning]), joint infection, fungal infections; \n• skin wart; \n• anaemia, low white blood cell counts; \n• allergic reactions; \n• increased lipid values, appetite disorders; \n• anxiety, depression, feeling sleepy and difficulty sleeping; \n• nerve disorders (such as multiple sclerosis and eye nerve inflammation), taste disturbances; \n• vision disturbances; \n• ear discomfort; \n• sensation of heart beating rapidly, high blood pressure; \n• asthma, shortness of breath; \n• abdominal symptoms (such as vomiting, indigestion, constipation), rectal bleeding; \n• skin disorders (such as psoriasis, eczema or infections)itchy rash, slow wound healing; \n• muscle weakness; \n• urinary disturbances (such as blood in urine, increased urinary frequency); \n• increased menstrual bleeding; \n• flu like symptoms, chest pain, swelling of the feet. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n160 \n\nRare (< 1/1000) \n• glaucoma; \n• skin cancer; \n• thyroid disorders; \n• protein in urine. \n \n• Other side effects that have been observed in patients taking Trudexa:  \n• tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections (infections that occur when resistance to disease \n\nis lowered); \n• lung disease. \n \nIf any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist.   \n \n \n5.
