Patients treated with zoledronic \nacid should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card.\n\nPosology\n\nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone\n\nAdults and elderly\n\nThe recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. \n\nPatients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D \ndaily. \n\nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n\n\n\n3\n\nTreatment of TIH\n\nAdults and elderly\nThe recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium 12.0 mg/dl or 3.0 \nmmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. \n\nRenal impairment\n\nTIH:\n\nZoledronic acid treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered \nonly after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum \ncreatinine > 400 \u00b5mol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH \npatients with serum creatinine < 400 \u00b5mol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). \n\nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone:\n\nWhen initiating treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone \nlesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. \nCLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which \nis defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with zoledronic acid, patients with \nserum creatinine > 265 \u00b5mol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. \n\nIn patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation \nof therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr 30\u201360 ml/min, the following zoledronic acid\ndose is recommended (see also section 4.4): \n\nBaseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) Zoledronic Acid Recommended Dose*\n\n> 60 4.0 mg zoledronic acid\n\n50\u201360 3.5 mg* zoledronic acid\n\n40\u201349 3.3 mg* zoledronic acid\n\n30\u201339 3.0 mg* zoledronic acid\n\n*Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg\u2022hr/l) (CLcr=75 ml/min). The reduced \ndoses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in patients \nwith creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. \n\nFollowing initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of zoledronic \nacid and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal \ndeterioration was defined as follows: \n\n- For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 \u00b5mol/l), an increase of 0.5 \nmg/dl or 44 \u00b5mol/l; \n\n- For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 \u00b5mol/l), an increase of 1.0 \nmg/dl or 88 \u00b5mol/l. \n\nIn the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned \nto within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at \nthe same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous use. \n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira, further diluted in 100 ml (see section 6.6), should be given as a single \nintravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced zoledronic acid doses are recommended \n(see section \u201cPosology\u201d above and section 4.4). \n\nInstructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n\nWithdraw an appropriate volume of the concentrate needed, as follows: \n\n- 4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose \n- 4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose \n- 3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose \n\nThe withdrawn amount of concentrate must be further diluted in 100 ml of sterile sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution. The dose must be given as a single \nintravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes. \n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion \nsolutions such as lactated Ringer's solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous \nsolution in a separate infusion line. \n\nPatients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic Acid \nHospira.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\u2022Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.\n\n\u2022Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nPatients must be assessed prior to administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately \nhydrated. \n\nOverhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. \n\nStandard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate \nand magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating zoledronic acid therapy. If \nhypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy \nmay be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function \nimpairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered. \n\n\n\n5\n\nOther products containing zoledronic acid as active substance are available for osteoporosis \nindications and treatment of Paget\u00b4s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid\nHospira should not be treated with such products or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the \ncombined effects of these agents are unknown.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-\nfree\u201d.\n\nRenal insufficiency\n\nPatients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated \nwith consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with zoledronic acid \noutweighs the possible risk. \n\nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2\u20133 months. \n\nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the \npotential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, \nmultiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products. While the risk is reduced with a dose of zoledronic acid administered over 15 \nminutes, deterioration in renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal \nfailure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg \nzoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration \nof zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related events, although less \nfrequently. \n\nPatients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon \ninitiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower \ndoses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration \nduring treatment, zoledronic acid should be withheld. Zoledronic acid should only be resumed when \nserum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at the \nsame dose as that given prior to treatment interruption.\n\nIn view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in \npatients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine 400 \u00b5mol/l or \n\n4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and 265 \u00b5mol/l or 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone \nmetastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe \nrenal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nHepatic insufficiency\n\nAs only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific \nrecommendations can be given for this patient population. \n\nOsteonecrosis\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials and in the post-marketing \nsetting in patients receiving zoledronic acid.\n\nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed\nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination \nwith appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior \nto treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors.\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual\u2019s risk of developing \nONJ:\n- Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of \n\nadministration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of \nbisphosphonate.\n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking.\n- Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to \n\nneck and head, corticosteroids.\n- History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures \n\n(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures\n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid.\n\nWhile on treatment, invasive dental procedures should be performed only after careful consideration\nand be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid administration. For patients who develop \nosteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the \ncondition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether \ndiscontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. The \nmanagement plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between the \ntreating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible.\n\nOsteonecrosis of other anatomical sites\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections.\n\nAdditionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and \nfemur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira.\n\nMusculoskeletal pain\n\nIn post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain \nhave been reported in patients taking zoledronic acid. However, such reports have been infrequent. \nThe time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most \npatients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when \nrechallenged with zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate. \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur\n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n\n\n7\n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture.\n\nHypocalcaemia\n\nHypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and \nneurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported \nsecondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation \nhave been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8).\nCaution is advised when Zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause \nhypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section \n4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating \nzoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used \nanticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions \noccurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit \nhuman P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been \nperformed. \n\nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop \ndiuretics since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for \nlonger periods than required (see section 4.4). \n\nCaution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during \ntreatment. \n\nIn multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledronic acid is \nused in combination with thalidomide.\n\nCaution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Hospira is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal \nproducts as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly \nwith these medicinal products.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction \nstudies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Zoledronic acid should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing \npotential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid is \ncontraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). \n\nFertility\n\nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the \ncompound's inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \n\n\n\n8\n\nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of zoledronic acid along with driving and \noperating of machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nWithin three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been \nreported, with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis \nwith subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of \nselected adverse reactions). \n\nThe following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications: \n\nRenal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial \nfibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are \nshown in Table 1. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed in Table 1, have been accumulated from clinical studies and \npost-marketing reports following predominantly chronic treatment with 4 mg zoledronic acid: \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \nconvention: Very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100), \nrare ( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \nTable 1\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nCommon: Anaemia \n\nUncommon: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia \n\nRare: Pancytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders\n\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction \n\nRare: Angioneurotic oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nUncommon: Anxiety, sleep disturbance \n\nRare: Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon: Headache \n\nUncommon: Dizziness, paraesthesia, dysgusia, hypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, tremor, \n\n\n\n9\n\nsomnolence \n\nVery rare: Convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany (secondary to hypocalcaemia)\n\nEye disorders\n\nCommon: Conjunctivitis \n\nUncommon: Blurred vision, scleritis and orbital inflammation \n\nRare: Uveitis\n\nVery rare: Episcleritis \n\nCardiac disorders\n\nUncommon: Hypertension, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, hypotension leading to \nsyncope or circulatory collapse \n\nRare: Bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia (secondary to hypocalcaemia)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nUncommon: Dyspnoea, cough, bronchoconstriction \n\nRare Interstitial lung disease\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nCommon: Nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite\n\nUncommon: Diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, stomatitis, dry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nUncommon: Pruritus, rash (including erythematous and macular rash), increased \nsweating \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\n\nCommon: Bone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, generalised pain \n\nUncommon: Muscle spasms, osteonecrosis of the jaw\n\nVery rare: Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal (bisphosphonate class adverse \nreaction) and other anatomical sites including femur and hip\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nCommon: Renal impairment \n\nUncommon: Acute renal failure, haematuria, proteinuria \n\nRare Acquired Fanconi syndrome\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nCommon: Fever, flu-like syndrome (including fatigue, rigors, malaise and flushing) \n\nUncommon: Asthenia, peripheral oedema, injection site reactions (including pain, \nirritation, swelling, induration), chest pain, weight increase, anaphylactic \nreaction/shock, urticaria \n\nRare: Arthritis and joint swelling as a symptom of acute phase reaction\n\nInvestigations\n\nVery \ncommon: \n\nHypophosphataemia \n\n\n\n10\n\nCommon: Blood creatinine and blood urea increased, hypocalcaemia \n\nUncommon: Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia \n\nRare: Hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRenal function impairment\nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety \ndata from trials for the use of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events \nsuspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma \n(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that \nmay increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal \nimpairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of \nnephrotoxic medicinal products or using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal \ndeterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial \ndose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). Many of \nthese patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection \nincluding osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions \nor other dental surgeries. \n\nAtrial fibrillation\nIn one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nzoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), \nthe overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious \nadverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic \nacid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in \nother trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks in \noncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single \nclinical trial is unknown. \n\nAcute phase reaction\nThis adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, \nheadache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint \nswelling. The onset time is 3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion, and the reaction is also referred to \nusing the terms \u201cflu-like\u201d or \u201cpost-dose\u201d symptoms. \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur\nDuring post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): \n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction).\n\nHypocalcaemia-related ADRs\nHypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based \non the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an \nassociation between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary \ndevelopment of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between \nhypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, \nhypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n11\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nClinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up \nto 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than \nthose recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment \n(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) \nabnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should \nbe administered as clinically indicated.\n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC \ncode: M05BA08 \n\nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of \nosteoclastic bone resorption. \n\nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, \nbut the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In \nlong-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the \nformation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. \n\nIn addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-\ntumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone \ndisease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: \n\n- In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow microenvironment, \nmaking it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and anti-pain activity. \n\n- In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour \ncells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer medicinal products, anti-adhesion/invasion \nactivity. \n\nClinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies \ninvolving bone\n\nThe first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to \nplacebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic \nacid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related \nevent (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of \nevents per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in \ndeveloping SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving \nzoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference \nreached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered \npathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 2. \n\n\n\n12\n\nIn a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg \nsignificantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by \n> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk \nreduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo.

Patients \nreceived either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were evenly \ndistributed between zoledronic acid -treated and placebo groups. \n\nThe SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The \nproportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic \nacid -treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first \nSRE was not reached in the zoledronic acid -treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly \nprolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a \nmultiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. \n\nIn the zoledronic acid -treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the \nBrief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, \nwhen compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below \nbaseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score. \n\n\n\n15\n\nFigure 1: Mean changes from baseline in BPI scores. Statistically significant differences are \nmarked (*p<0.05) for between treatment comparisons (4 mg zoledronic acid vs. placebo)\n\nClinical trial results in the treatment of TIH\n\nClinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic \nacid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose \nfinding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective \ndoses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2\u20132.5 mg. \n\nTo assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal \nmulticentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster \nnormalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and \n8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed: \n\nTable 5: Proportion of complete responders by day in the combined TIH studies \n\nDay 4 Day 7 Day 10\n\nZoledronic acid 4 mg \n(N=86)\n\n45.3% (p=0.104) 82.6% (p=0.005)* 88.4% (p=0.002)*\n\nZoledronic acid 8 mg \n(N=90)\n\n55.6% (p=0.021)* 83.3% (p=0.010)* 86.7% (p=0.015)*\n\nPamidronate 90 mg \n(N=99)\n\n33.3% 63.6% 69.7%\n\n*p-values compared to pamidronate.\n\nTime on study (weeks)\n\nB\nP\n\nI \nm\n\nea\nn\n\n c\nh\n\nan\ng\n\ne \nfr\n\nom\n b\n\na\nse\n\nli\nn\n\ne\n\nPlacebo\n\nZoledronic Acid\n\n\n\n16\n\nMedian time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected \nserum calcium 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 17 \ndays for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg \nzoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid \ndoses. \n\nIn clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, \n8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these \npatients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data \navailable allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. \n\nIn clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety \nprofile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was \nsimilar in types and severity. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to \n17 years\n\nThe effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) \nwith severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in \none international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment \ngroup, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening \nperiod during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In \nthe clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a \nmaximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg \nzoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was \nconducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly \nzoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year \nof treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but \nthe trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In \nparticular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse \nevents of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% \n(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe \nosteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was \ncomparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76).\nInterpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in \npatients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. \n\nThe type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in \nadults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked \nunder headings of frequency, are presented in Table 6. The following conventional classification is \nused: very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n\n\n\n17\n\nTable 6: Adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta1\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon: Headache\n\nCardiac disorders\n\nCommon: Tachycardia\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nCommon: Nasopharyngitis\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nVery \ncommon:\n\nVomiting, nausea\n\nCommon: Abdominal pain\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\n\nCommon: Pain in extremities, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nVery \ncommon:\n\nPyrexia, fatigue\n\nCommon: Acute phase reaction, pain\n\nInvestigations\n\nVery \ncommon:\n\nHypocalcaemia\n\nCommon: Hypophosphataemia\n\n1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that \nthese cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8) \n\nIn paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with \nmore pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in \ncomparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSingle and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nwith bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose \nindependent. \n\nAfter initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly \nincreased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% \nof peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. \n\n\n\n18\n\nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t\u00bd\u03b1 0.24 and t\u00bd\u03b2 1.87 hours, followed by \na long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t\u00bd\u03b3 146 hours. There was no \naccumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is \nnot metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 \u00b1 16% of the \nadministered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. \nFrom the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via \nthe kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 \u00b1 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, \nage, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease \nin zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the \nplasma concentration versus time curve. \n\nThe interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with \nother bisphosphonates. \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in \npatients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, \nshows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the \nfaeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. \n\nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 \u00b1 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 \u00b1 29 ml/min (range 22 \nto 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with \ncreatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the \ncorresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a \npatient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). \n\nIn an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, \nwith a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to \n5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at \n2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric patients\n\nLimited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic \nacid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg \ndose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic \nacid systemic exposure.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAcute toxicity\n\nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. \n\nSubchronic and chronic toxicity\n\nZoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to \ndogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously \nin rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2\u20133 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well \ntolerated. \n\n\n\n19\n\nThe most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the \nmetaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the \ncompound's pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n\nThe safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal \nstudies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and \nmultiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06\u20130.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses \nequivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat \nadministration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid \nproduced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and \nlungs, and at intravenous injection sites. \n\nReproduction toxicity\n\nZoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses 0.2 mg/kg. Although no \nteratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was \nobserved at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. \n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential\n\nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.\n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nMannitol \nSodium citrate \nWater for injections\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nTo avoid potential incompatibilities, Zoledronic Acid Hospira is to be diluted with sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution. \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion \nsolutions such as lactated Ringer's solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous \nsolution in a separate infusion line.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n3 years\n\nAfter dilution: From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used \nimmediately.

Patients treated with zoledronic \nacid should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card.\n\nPosology\n\nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone\n\nAdults and elderly\n\nThe recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. \n\nPatients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D \ndaily. \n\nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n\n\n\n22\n\nTreatment of TIH\n\nAdults and elderly\n\nThe recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium \u2265 12.0 mg/dl or \n3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. \n\nRenal impairment\n\nTIH:\n\nZoledronic acid treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered \nonly after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum \ncreatinine > 400 \u00b5mol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH \npatients with serum creatinine < 400 \u00b5mol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). \n\nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone:\n\nWhen initiating treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone \nlesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. \nCLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which \nis defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with zoledronic acid, patients with \nserum creatinine > 265 \u00b5mol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. \n\nFor patients with normal renal function (defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min), zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml \nsolution for infusion may be administered directly without any further preparation. In patients with \nbone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, \nwhich is defined for this population as CLcr 30\u201360 ml/min, reduced Zoledronic Acid Hospira doses \nare recommended (see also section 4.4). \n\nBaseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) Zoledronic Acid Hospira recommended dose*\n> 60 4.0 mg zoledronic acid\n\n50\u201360 3.5 mg* zoledronic acid\n40\u201349 3.3 mg* zoledronic acid\n30\u201339 3.0 mg* zoledronic acid\n\n* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg\u2022hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The \nreduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in \npatients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min.\n\nFollowing initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of Zoledronic \nAcid Hospira and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, \nrenal deterioration was defined as follows: \n\n- For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 \u00b5mol/l), an increase of 0.5 \nmg/dl or 44 \u00b5mol/l; \n\n- For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 \u00b5mol/l), an increase of 1.0 \nmg/dl or 88 \u00b5mol/l. \n\nIn the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned \nto within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic Acid Hospira treatment should be \nresumed at the same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n\n\n\n23\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous use.\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes.\nIn patients with normal renal function, defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min, zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml \nsolution for infusion must not be further diluted. \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced Zoledronic Acid Hospira doses are \nrecommended (see section \u201cPosology\u201d above and section 4.4).\n\nTo prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr \u2264 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. \nRemove the volume of Zoledronic Acid Hospira solution indicated from the bag prior to \nadministration. \n\nTable 1: Preparation of reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion \n\nBaseline creatinine clearance \n(ml/min) \n\nRemove the following amount \nof Zoledronic Acid Hospira \n4 mg/100 ml solution for \ninfusion (ml) \n\nAdjusted dose (mg zoledronic \nacid) \n\n50-60 12.0 3.5\n40-49 18.0 3.3\n30-39 25.0 3.0\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira must not be mixed with other infusion solutions and should be administered \nas a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. \n\nPatients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic Acid \nHospira.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1 \n\n\u2022 Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nPatients must be assessed prior to administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately \nhydrated. \n\nOverhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. \n\nStandard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate \nand magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating zoledronic acid therapy. If \nhypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy \n\n\n\n24\n\nmay be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function \nimpairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered. \n\nOther products containing zoledronic acid as active substance are available for osteoporosis \nindications and treatment of Paget\u00b4s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid \nHospira should not be treated with such products or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the \ncombined effects of these agents are unknown.\n\nThis medicinal product contains 16 mmol (or 360 mg) sodium per dose. To be taken into consideration \nby patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\nRenal insufficiency\n\nPatients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated \nwith consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with zoledronic acid \noutweighs the possible risk. \n\nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2\u20133 months. \n\nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the \npotential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, \nmultiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products. While the risk is reduced with a dose of zoledronic acid administered over 15 \nminutes, deterioration in renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal \nfailure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg \nzoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration \nof zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related events, although less \nfrequently. \n\nPatients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon \ninitiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower \ndoses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration \nduring treatment, zoledronic acid should be withheld. Zoledronic acid should only be resumed when \nserum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at the \nsame dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n\nIn view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in \npatients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine 400 \u00b5mol/l or 4.5 \nmg/dl for patients with TIH and 265 \u00b5mol/l or 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone \nmetastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe \nrenal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nHepatic insufficiency\n\nAs only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific \nrecommendations can be given for this patient population. \n\nOsteonecrosis \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials and in the post-marketing \nsetting in patients receiving zoledronic acid. The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment \nshould be delayed in patients with unhealed open soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical \nemergency situations. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual \n\n\n\n25\n\nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with \nconcomitant risk factors.\n\nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual\u2019s risk of developing \nONJ:\n- Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of \n\nadministration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of \nbisphosphonate.\n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking.\n- Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to \n\nneck and head, corticosteroids.\n- History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures \n\n(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures\n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid.\n\nWhile on treatment, invasive dental procedures should be performed only after careful consideration \nand be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid administration. For patients who develop \nosteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the \ncondition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether \ndiscontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. The \nmanagement plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between the \ntreating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible.\n\nOsteonecrosis of other anatomical sites\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections.\n\nAdditionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and \nfemur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira.\n\nMusculoskeletal pain\n\nIn post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain \nhave been reported in patients taking zoledronic acid. However, such reports have been infrequent. \nThe time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most \npatients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when \nrechallenged with zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate. \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur\n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \n\n\n\n26\n\nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture.\n\nHypocalcaemia\n\nHypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and \nneurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported \nsecondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation \nhave been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8).\nCaution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause \nhypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section \n4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating \nzoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used \nanticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions \noccurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit \nhuman P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been \nperformed. \n\nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop \ndiuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for \nlonger periods than required (see section 4.4). \n\nCaution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during \ntreatment. \n\nIn multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledronic acid is \nused in combination with thalidomide.\n\nCaution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Hospira is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal \nproducts, as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly \nwith these medicinal products.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction \nstudies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Zoledronic acid should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing \npotential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid is \ncontraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n27\n\nFertility\n\nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the \ncompound's inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of zoledronic acid along with driving and \noperating of machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nWithin three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been \nreported, with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis \nwith subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of \nselected adverse reactions). \n\nThe following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications: \n\nRenal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial \nfibrillation, anaphylaxis, Interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are \nshown in Table 2. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed in Table 2, have been accumulated from clinical studies and \npost-marketing reports following predominantly chronic treatment with 4 mg zoledronic acid: \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \nconvention: Very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100), \nrare ( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n\nTable 2\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nCommon: Anaemia \n\nUncommon: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia \n\nRare: Pancytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders\n\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction \n\nRare: Angioneurotic oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nUncommon: Anxiety, sleep disturbance \n\n\n\n28\n\nRare: Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon: Headache \n\nUncommon: Dizziness, paraesthesia, dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, tremor, \nsomnolence \n\nVery rare: Convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany (secondary to hypocalcaemia)\n\nEye disorders\n\nCommon: Conjunctivitis \n\nUncommon: Blurred vision, scleritis and orbital inflammation \n\nRare Uveitis\n\nVery rare: Episcleritis \n\nCardiac disorders\n\nUncommon: Hypertension, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, hypotension leading to \nsyncope or circulatory collapse \n\nRare: Bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia (secondary to hypocalcaemia)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nUncommon: Dyspnoea, cough, bronchoconstriction \n\nRare Interstitial lung disease\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nCommon: Nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite\n\nUncommon: Diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, stomatitis, dry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nUncommon: Pruritus, rash (including erythematous and macular rash), increased \nsweating \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\n\nCommon: Bone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, generalised pain \n\nUncommon: Muscle spasms, osteonecrosis of the jaw\n\nVery rare: Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal (bisphosphonate class adverse \nreaction) and other anatomical sites including femur and hip\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nCommon: Renal impairment \n\nUncommon: Acute renal failure, haematuria, proteinuria \n\nRare Acquired Fanconi syndrome\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nCommon: Fever, flu-like syndrome (including fatigue, rigors, malaise and flushing) \n\nUncommon: Asthenia, peripheral oedema, injection site reactions (including pain, \nirritation, swelling, induration), chest pain, weight increase, anaphylactic \nreaction/shock, urticaria \n\n\n\n29\n\nRare: Arthritis and joint swelling as a symptom of acute phase reaction\n\nInvestigations\n\nVery \ncommon: \n\nHypophosphataemia \n\nCommon: Blood creatinine and blood urea increased, hypocalcaemia \n\nUncommon: Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia \n\nRare: Hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRenal function impairment\nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety \ndata from trials for the use of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events \nsuspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma \n(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that \nmay increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal \nimpairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of \nnephrotoxic medicinal products or using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal \ndeterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial \ndose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). Many of \nthese patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection \nincluding osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions \nor other dental surgeries. \n\nAtrial fibrillation\nIn one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nzoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), \nthe overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious \nadverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic \nacid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in \nother trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks in \noncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single \nclinical trial is unknown. \n\nAcute phase reaction\nThis adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, \nheadache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint \nswelling. The onset time is 3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion, and the reaction is also referred to \nusing the terms \u201cflu-like\u201d or \u201cpost-dose\u201d symptoms. \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur\nDuring post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): \n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction).\n\n\n\n30\n\nHypocalcaemia-related ADRs\nHypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based \non the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an \nassociation between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary \ndevelopment of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between \nhypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, \nhypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nClinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up \nto 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than \nthose recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment \n(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) \nabnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should \nbe administered as clinically indicated.\n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC \ncode: M05BA08 \n\nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of \nosteoclastic bone resorption. \n\nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, \nbut the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In \nlong-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the \nformation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. \n\nIn addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-\ntumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone \ndisease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: \n\n- In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow microenvironment, \nmaking it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and anti-pain activity. \n\n- In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour \ncells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer medicinal products, anti-adhesion/invasion \nactivity. \n\nClinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies \ninvolving bone\n\nThe first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to \nplacebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic \nacid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related \nevent (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of \n\n\n\n31\n\nevents per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in \ndeveloping SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving \nzoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference \nreached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered \npathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 3. \n\nIn a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg \nsignificantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by \n> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk \nreduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo.

Patients \nreceived either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were evenly \ndistributed between zoledronic acid -treated and placebo groups. \n\nThe SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The \nproportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic \nacid -treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first \nSRE was not reached in the zoledronic acid -treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly \nprolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a \nmultiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. \n\nIn the zoledronic acid treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the \nBrief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, \nwhen compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below \nbaseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score. \n\nFigure 1: Mean changes from baseline in BPI scores. Statistically significant differences are \nmarked (*p<0.05) for between treatment comparisons (4 mg zoledronic acid vs. placebo)\n\nClinical trial results in the treatment of TIH\n\nClinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic \nacid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion.

There was faster \nnormalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and \n8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed: \n\nTable 6: Proportion of complete responders by day in the combined TIH studies \n\nDay 4 Day 7 Day 10\n\nZoledronic acid 4 mg \n(N=86)\n\n45.3% (p=0.104) 82.6% (p=0.005)* 88.4% (p=0.002)*\n\nZoledronic acid 8 mg \n(N=90)\n\n55.6% (p=0.021)* 83.3% (p=0.010)* 86.7% (p=0.015)*\n\nPamidronate 90 mg \n(N=99)\n\n33.3% 63.6% 69.7%\n\n*p-values compared to pamidronate.\n\nMedian time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected \nserum calcium 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 17 \ndays for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg \nzoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid \ndoses. \n\nIn clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, \n8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these \npatients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data \navailable allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. \n\nIn clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety \nprofile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was \nsimilar in types and severity. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to \n17 years\n\nThe effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) \nwith severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in \none international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment \ngroup, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening \nperiod during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In \nthe clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a \nmaximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg \nzoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was \nconducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly \nzoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year \nof treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but \nthe trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In \n\n\n\n35\n\nparticular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse \nevents of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% \n(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe \nosteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was \ncomparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). \nInterpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in \npatients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. \n\nThe type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in \nadults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked \nunder headings of frequency, are presented in Table 7. The following conventional classification is \nused: very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n\nTable 7: Adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta1\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon: Headache\n\nCardiac disorders\n\nCommon: Tachycardia\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nCommon: Nasopharyngitis\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nVery \ncommon:\n\nVomiting, nausea\n\nCommon: Abdominal pain\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\n\nCommon: Pain in extremities, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nVery \ncommon:\n\nPyrexia, fatigue\n\nCommon: Acute phase reaction, pain\n\nInvestigations\n\nVery \ncommon:\n\nHypocalcaemia\n\nCommon: Hypophosphataemia\n\n1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that \nthese cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8) \n\nIn paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with \nmore pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in \ncomparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \n\n\n\n36\n\nthe treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSingle and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nwith bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose \nindependent. \n\nAfter initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly \nincreased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% \nof peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. \n\nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t\u00bd\u03b1 0.24 and t\u00bd\u03b2 1.87 hours, followed by \na long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t\u00bd\u03b3 146 hours. There was no \naccumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is \nnot metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 \u00b1 16% of the \nadministered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. \nFrom the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via \nthe kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 \u00b1 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, \nage, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease \nin zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the \nplasma concentration versus time curve. \n\nThe interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with \nother bisphosphonates. \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in \npatients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, \nshows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the \nfaeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. \n\nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 \u00b1 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 \u00b1 29 ml/min (range 22 \nto 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with \ncreatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the \ncorresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a \npatient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). \n\nIn an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, \nwith a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to \n5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at \n2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric patients\n\nLimited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic \nacid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg \ndose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic \nacid systemic exposure.\n\n\n\n37\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAcute toxicity\n\nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. \n\nSubchronic and chronic toxicity\n\nZoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to \ndogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously \nin rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2\u20133 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well \ntolerated. \n\nThe most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the \nmetaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the \ncompound's pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n\nThe safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal \nstudies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and \nmultiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06\u20130.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses \nequivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat \nadministration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid \nproduced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and \nlungs, and at intravenous injection sites. \n\nReproduction toxicity\n\nZoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses 0.2 mg/kg. Although no \nteratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was \nobserved at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. \n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential\n\nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.\n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nMannitol \nSodium citrate \nSodium chloride\nWater for injections\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nThis medicinal product must not be allowed to come into contact with any calcium-containing \nsolutions and it must not be mixed or given intravenously with any other medicinal product in the \nsame infusion line.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\nUnopened bag: 2 years. \n\n\n\n38\n\nAfter first opening: From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately.

This is \nespecially important for the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy.\n\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Zoledronic Acid \nHospira administration.\n\nFor the treatment of Paget's disease, zoledronic acid should be prescribed only by physicians with \nexperience in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone. The recommended dose is a single \nintravenous infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid. In patients with Paget\u2019s disease, it is strongly advised \nthat adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is \nensured for at least 10 days following Zoledronic Acid Hospira administration (see section 4.4).\n\nRe-treatment of Paget's disease: After initial treatment with zoledronic acid in Paget's disease, an \nextended remission period is observed in responding patients. Re-treatment consists of an additional \nintravenous infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid after an interval of one year or longer from initial \ntreatment in patients who have relapsed. Limited data on re-treatment of Paget\u2019s disease are available \n(see section 5.1). \n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nZoledronic acid is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n\n\n\n41\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 35 ml/min. \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\nElderly\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in \nelderly patients and younger subjects. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous use. \n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira (5 mg in 100 ml ready-to-infuse solution) is administered via an infusion line \nand given at a constant infusion rate. The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes. For \ninformation on the infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira, see section 6.6.\n\nPatients treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira should be given the package leaflet and the patient \nreminder card\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n\n- Patients with hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n- Severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see section 4.4).\n\n- Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRenal function\n\nThe use of Zoledronic Acid Hospira in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < \n35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an increased risk of renal failure in this population.\n\nRenal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8), \nespecially in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or other risks including advanced age, \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy (see section 4.5), or \ndehydration occurring after zoledronic acid administration. Renal impairment has been observed in \npatients after a single administration, renal failure requiring dialysis or with a fatal outcome has rarely \noccurred in patients with underlying renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described above. \n\nThe following precautions should be taken into account to minimise the risk of renal adverse \nreactions: \n\n\u2022 Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using the Cockcroft-Gault \nformula before each Zoledronic Acid Hospira dose.\n\n\n\n42\n\n\u2022 Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with underlying impaired renal \nfunction. \n\n\u2022 Monitoring of serum creatinine should be considered in at-risk patients. \n\n\u2022 Zoledronic acid should be used with caution when concomitantly used with other medicinal products \nthat could impact renal function (see section 4.5). \n\n\u2022 Patients, especially elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy, should be appropriately \nhydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid. \n\n\u2022 A single dose of zoledronic acid should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be at \nleast 15 minutes (see section 4.2). \n\nHypocalcaemia\n\nPre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before \ninitiating therapy with zoledronic acid (see section 4.3). Other disturbances of mineral metabolism \nmust also be effectively treated (e.g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium \nmalabsorption). Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients. \n\nElevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget's disease of the bone. Due to the rapid onset of \neffect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may \ndevelop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of zoledronic acid (see section \n4.8). \n\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with zoledronic acid \nadministration. In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate \nsupplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at \nleast 10 days following zoledronic acid administration (see section 4.2). Patients should be informed \nabout symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk. \nMeasurement of serum calcium before infusion of zoledronic acid is recommended for patients with \nPaget\u00b4s disease. \n\nSevere and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported \nin patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.8). \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \n\nONJ has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid for \nosteoporosis (see section 4.8).\n\nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual \nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira in patients \nwith concomitant risk factors.\n\nThe following should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ:\n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \ndose of bone resorption therapy.\n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking.\n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck.\n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures, e.g. tooth extractions.\n\n\n\n43\n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed with caution and avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid \ntreatment.\n\nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \n\nfactors are mitigated where possible.\n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal\n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections.\n\nAtypical fractures of the femur\n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of \nZoledronic Acid Hospira can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly \nfollowing Zoledronic Acid Hospira administration.\n\nOther products containing zoledronic acid as active substance are available for oncology indications. \nPatients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira should not be treated with such products or any \nother bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the combined effects of these agents are unknown.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 ml dose of Zoledronic Acid \nHospira, i.e. essentially \u201csodium free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. Zoledronic acid is not \nsystemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro (see section \n5.2). Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) and \n\n\n\n44\n\ninteractions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound medicinal products are therefore \nunlikely. \n\nZoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion. Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is \nadministered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e.g. \naminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration) (see section 4.4). \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, the systemic exposure to concomitant medicinal products that are \nprimarily excreted via the kidney may increase.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). There are no adequate \ndata on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have \nshown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations (see section 5.3). The potential risk \nfor humans is unknown. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is unknown \nwhether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nZoledronic acid is not recommended in women of childbearing potential. \n\nFertility\n\nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered related to the compound's \ninhibition of skeletal calcium mobilisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness, may affect the ability to drive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe overall percentage of patients who experienced adverse reactions were 44.7%, 16.7% and 10.2% \nafter the first, second and third infusion, respectively. Incidence of individual adverse reactions \nfollowing the first infusion was: fever (17.1%), myalgia (7.8%), flu-like symptoms (6.7%), arthralgia \n(4.8%) and headache (5.1%). The incidence of these reactions decreased markedly with subsequent \nannual doses of zoledronic acid. The majority of these reactions occur within the first three days \nfollowing zoledronic acid administration. The majority of these reactions were mild to moderate and \nresolved within three days of the event onset. The percentage of patients who experienced adverse \nreactions was lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, second and third infusion, \nrespectively), where prophylaxis against adverse reactions was used. \n\n\n\n45\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory.

Frequency cannot be estimated from available data. \n\u2020 Identified in post-marketing experience. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAtrial fibrillation\nIn the HORIZON - Pivotal Fracture Trial [PFT] (see section 5.1), the overall incidence of atrial \nfibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic \nacid and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in \n\n\n\n47\n\npatients receiving zoledronic acid (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(0.6%) (22 out of 3,852). The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is \nunknown. In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled \natrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between zoledronic acid (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%). For \natrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for zoledronic acid and 0.8% \nfor placebo. \n\nRenal impairment\nZoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment manifested as deterioration in renal \nfunction (i.e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure. Renal impairment has \nbeen observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing \nrenal dysfunction or additional risk factors (e.g. advanced age, oncology patients with chemotherapy, \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy, severe dehydration), the \nmajority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3-4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after a \nsingle administration. \n\nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) \nand the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the zoledronic acid and \nplacebo treatment groups over three years. There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed \nwithin 10 days in 1.8% of zoledronic acid-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. \n\nHypocalcaemia\nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium \nlevels (less than 1.87 mmol/l) following zoledronic acid administration. No symptomatic cases of \nhypocalcaemia were observed. \n\nIn the Paget's disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of \npatients, in all of whom it resolved. \n\nBased on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference \nrange (less than 2.10 mmol/l) occurred in 2.3% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in a large clinical \ntrial compared to 21% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in the Paget's disease trials. The frequency of \nhypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions. \n\nAll patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal \nosteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget's disease \ntrials (see also section 4.2). In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip\nfracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading \ndose of vitamin D prior to zoledronic acid administration (see section 4.2). \n\nLocal reactions\nIn a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/or pain, were \nreported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid. \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported; predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). In a large \nclinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with \nzoledronic acid and one patient treated with placebo. Cases of ONJ have been reported in the post-\nmarketing setting for zoledronic acid.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n\n\n48\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nClinical experience with acute overdose is limited. Patients who have received doses higher than those \nrecommended should be carefully monitored. In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant \nhypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/or an intravenous \ninfusion of calcium gluconate.\n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC \ncode: M05BA08 \n\nMechanism of action\n\nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on \nbone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone. \n\nThe main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate \nsynthase. The long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity for \nthe active site of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase and its strong binding affinity to bone \nmineral. \n\nClinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone\n\nZoledronic acid was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to \nmoderate Paget's disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6\u20133.0 times the \nupper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by \nradiographic evidence.\n\nThe efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 \nmonths was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials. After 6 months, zoledronic acid showed \n96% (169/176) and 89% (156/176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) normalisation \nrates compared to 74% (127/171) and 58% (99/171) for risedronate (all p<0.001). \n\nIn the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to \nbaseline were observed over 6 months for zoledronic acid and risedronate. \n\nPatients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter \nan extended follow-up period. Of the 153 zoledronic acid-treated patients and 115 risedronate-treated \npatients who entered an extended observation study, after a median duration of follow-up of 3.8 years \nfrom time of dosing, the proportion of patients ending the Extended Observation Period due to the \nneed for re-treatment (clinical judgment) was higher for risedronate (48 patients, or 41.7%) compared \nwith zoledronic acid (11 patients, or 7.2%). The mean time of ending the Extended Observation Period \ndue to the need for Paget\u2019s re-treatment from the initial dose was longer for zoledronic acid (7.7 years) \nthan for risedronate (5.1 years). \n\nSix patients who achieved therapeutic response 6 months after treatment with zoledronic acid and later \nexperienced disease relapse during the extended follow-up period were re-treated with zoledronic acid\n\n\n\n49\n\nafter a mean time of 6.5 years from initial treatment to re-treatment. Five of the 6 patients had SAP \nwithin the normal range at month 6 (Late Observation Carried Forward, LOCF).\n\nBone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget's disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg \nzoledronic acid. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired \nbone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects. These results were consistent with \nbiochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nPaget's disease of the bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSingle and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nyielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent. \n\nDistribution\nAfter initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased \nrapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of \npeak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels. \n\nElimination\nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t\u00bd\u03b1 0.24 and t\u00bd\u03b2 1.87 hours, followed by \na long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t\u00bd\u03b3 146 hours. There was no \naccumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. The early \ndisposition phases (\u03b1 and \u03b2, with t\u00bd values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and \nexcretion via the kidneys. \n\nZoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, \n39 \u00b1 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound \nto bone tissue. This uptake into bone is common for all bisphosphonates and is presumably a \nconsequence of the structural analogy to pyrophosphate. As with other bisphosphonates, the retention \ntime of zoledronic acid in bones is very long. From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into \nthe systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 \u00b1 2.5 l/h, \nindependent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight. The inter- and intra-subject \nvariation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36% and 34%, respectively. \nIncreasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid \nconcentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration \nversus time curve. \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with zoledronic acid. Since \nzoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity \nas a direct-acting and/or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic \nacid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme systems. Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins \n(approximately 43-55% bound) and binding is concentration independent. Therefore, interactions \nresulting from displacement of highly protein-bound medicinal products are unlikely. \n\n\n\n50\n\nSpecial populations (see section 4.2)\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 \u00b1 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 \u00b1 29 ml/min (range 22 \nto 143 ml/min) in the 64 patients studied. Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to \n40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack \nof accumulation of medicinal product with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that \ndose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50\u201380 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment \ndown to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/min are not necessary. The use of zoledronic acid in patients \nwith severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an increased \nrisk of renal failure in this population.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAcute toxicity\n\nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic \nexposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects. \n\nSubchronic and chronic toxicity\n\nIn the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when \ngiven 0.6 mg/kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that \ncorresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute \ninfusions of 0.25 mg/kg administered at 2-3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 \ntimes the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs. In the intravenous bolus studies, \nthe doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration: 0.2 and 0.02 mg/kg daily \nwas well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs, respectively but only 0.01 mg/kg and 0.005 mg/kg in \nrats and dogs, respectively, when given for 52 weeks. \n\nLonger-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum \nintended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal \ntract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration. The clinical relevance of these findings is \nunknown. The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary \nspongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that \nreflected the compound's pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n\nReproduction toxicity\n\nTeratology studies were performed in two species, both via subcutaneous administration. \nTeratogenicity was observed in rats at doses 0.2 mg/kg and was manifested by external, visceral and \nskeletal malformations. Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg body weight) tested in \nrats. No teratological or embryo/foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was \nmarked at 0.1 mg/kg due to decreased serum calcium levels. \n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential\n\nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.\n\n\n\n51\n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nMannitol \nSodium citrate \nWater for injections\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nThis medicinal product must not be allowed to come into contact with any calcium-containing \nsolutions.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Zoledronic Acid Hospira is and what it is used for\n\nThe active substance in Zoledronic Acid Hospira is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of \nsubstances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing \ndown the rate of bone change. It is used:\n\u2022 To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread of \ncancer from primary site to the bone).\n\u2022 To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the \npresence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the release of \ncalcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n\nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira and \nwill check your response to treatment at regular intervals.\n\nYou should not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira:\n\u2212 if you are breast-feeding.\n\u2212 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of\nsubstances to which zoledronic acid belongs), or any of the other ingredients of Zoledronic Acid \nHospira (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before being given Zoledronic Acid Hospira:\n\u2212 if you have or have had a kidney problem.\n\u2212 if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or \nloosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start treatment \nwith Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n\u2013 if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you \nare being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira and inform your doctor about your dental treatment.\n\nWhile being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including \nregular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups.\n\n\n\n68\n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a \ncondition called osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\nPatients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are \nundergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are \nsmokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \ndisorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\nReduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry \nskin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart \nbeat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to \nsevere hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these \napply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be \ncorrected before initiating the first dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. You will be given adequate \ncalcium and vitamin D supplements.\n\nPatients aged 65 years and over\nZoledronic Acid Hospira can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to \nsuggest that any extra precautions are needed.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nZoledronic Acid Hospira is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 \nyears.\n\nOther medicines and Zoledronic Acid Hospira\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. It is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking:\n\u2013 Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used to \ntreat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to treat \nhigh blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the combination of these\nwith bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become too low.\n\u2013 Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any other \nmedicines which may harm your kidneys.\n\u2013 Any other medicines that contain zoledronic acid which is used to treat osteoporosis and other non-\ncancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of these \nmedicines taken together with Zoledronic Acid Hospira are unknown.\n- Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with Zoledronic \nAcid Hospira has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nYou should not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or \nthink that you may be pregnant.\n\nYou must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are breast-feeding.\n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThere have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zoledronic Acid \nHospira. You should therefore be careful when driving, using machines or performing other tasks that \nneed full attention.\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n\n\n69\n\n3. How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is used\n\n\u2212 Zoledronic Acid Hospira must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering \nbisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein (also referred to as \u2018IV\u2019 administration).\n\u2212 Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent \ndehydration.\n\u2013 Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nHow much Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\u2013 The usual single dose given is 4 mg.\n\u2013 If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity of \nyour kidney problem.\n\nHow often Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\u2013 If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you will be \ngiven one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira every three to four weeks.\n\u2013 If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only be \ngiven one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira.\n\nHow Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\u2013 Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 \nminutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line.\n\nPatients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D \nsupplements to be taken each day.\n\nIf you are given more Zoledronic Acid Hospira than you should be\nIf you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your \ndoctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of \ncalcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney \nimpairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by \ninfusion.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, Zoledronic Acid Hospira can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nThe most common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time.\n\nTell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\u2212 Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific blood \ntests).\n\u2212 Low level of calcium in the blood.\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n\u2212 Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw discharge, \nnumbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or loosening of a tooth. These could be signs of bone \ndamage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience such \nsymptoms while being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira or after stopping treatment.\n\u2212 Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for \npostmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this irregular heart\nrhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have \nreceived zoledronic acid.\n\u2212 Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat.\n\n\n\n70\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\n\uf02d As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia).\n\uf02d A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your \n\ndoctor with certain urine tests).\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n\u2212 As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to \nhypocalcaemia).\n\u2212 Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These could \nbe signs of bone damage in the ear.\n\u2212 Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially the \nhip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or \nworsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira or after \nstopping treatment.\n\nTell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\u2212 Low level of phosphate in the blood.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\u2212 Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and \nbone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the\nsymptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days).\n\u2212 Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite.\n\u2212 Conjunctivitis.\n\u2212 Low level of red blood cells (anaemia).\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n\u2212 Hypersensitivity reactions.\n\u2212 Low blood pressure.\n\u2212 Chest pain.\n\u2212 Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching.\n\u2212 High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste disturbances, \n\ntrembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dry \nmouth.\n\n\u2212 Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets.\n\u2212 Low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. Your doctor will monitor this and take any \n\nnecessary measures.\n\u2212 Weight increase\n\u2212 Increased sweating\n\u2212 Sleepiness\n\u2212 Blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light.\n\u2212 Sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse.\n\u2212 Difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing.\n\u2212 Urticaria.\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\n\u2212 Slow heart beat.\n\u2212 Confusion.\n\u2212 Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for osteoporosis \n\nmay occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, \nhip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone.\n\n\uf02d Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs)\n\n\n\n71\n\n\uf02d Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling.\n\uf02dPainful redness and/or swelling of the eye.\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n\u2212 Fainting due to low blood pressure.\n\u2212 Severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain, occasionally incapacitating.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

If a lower dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira is required, first withdraw the appropriate volume \nas indicated below and then dilute it further with 100 ml of infusion solution. To avoid potential \nincompatibilities, the infusion solution used for dilution must be either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution.\n\nDo not mix Zoledronic Acid Hospira concentrate with calcium-containing or other divalent \ncation containing solutions such as lactated Ringer\u2019s solution.\n\nInstructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira:\nWithdraw the appropriate volume of the liquid concentrate, as follows:\n- 4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose\n- 4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose\n- 3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose\n\n\u2212 For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from\nparticles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the\npreparation of the infusion.\n\n\u2212 From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used\nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the\nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C. The\nrefrigerated solution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration.\n\n\u2212 The solution containing zoledronic acid is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a \nseparate infusion line. The hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following \nadministration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately hydrated.\n\n\u2212 Studies with several types of infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and\npolypropylene showed no incompatibility with zoledronic acid.\n\n\u2212 Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zoledronic Acid Hospira with other intravenously \nadministered substances, Zoledronic Acid Hospira must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts/substances and should always be given through a separate infusion line.\n\n\n\n74\n\nHow to store Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n\n\u2212 Keep Zoledronic Acid Hospira out of the reach and sight of children.\n\u2212 Do not use Zoledronic Acid Hospira after the expiry date stated on the pack.\n\u2212 The unopened vial does not require any specific storage conditions.\n\u2212 The diluted Zoledronic Acid Hospira infusion solution should be used immediately in order to avoid \nmicrobial contamination.\n\n\n\n75\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion\nZoledronic acid\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n\u2212 Keep this leaflet.

Tell your doctor if you are or \nthink that you may be pregnant.\n\nYou must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are breast-feeding.\n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThere have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zoledronic Acid \nHospira. You should therefore be careful when driving, using machines or performing other tasks that \nneed full attention.\n\n\n\n77\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira contains sodium\nThis medicine contains 16 mmol (or 360 mg) sodium per dose. To be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n3. How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is used\n\n\u2212 Zoledronic Acid Hospira must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering \nbisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein.\n\u2212 Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent \ndehydration.\n\u2013 Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nHow much Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\u2013 The usual single dose given is 4 mg.\n\u2013 If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity of \nyour kidney problem.\n\nHow often Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\u2013 If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you will be \ngiven one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira every three to four weeks.\n\u2013 If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only be \ngiven one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira.\n\nHow Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\u2013 Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 \nminutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line.\n\nPatients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D \nsupplements to be taken each day.\n\nIf you are given more Zoledronic Acid Hospira than you should be\nIf you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your \ndoctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of \ncalcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney \nimpairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by \ninfusion.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, Zoledronic Acid Hospira can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nThe most common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time.\n\nTell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\u2212 Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific blood \ntests).\n\u2212 Low level of calcium in the blood.\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\u2212 Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or\nnon-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or \nloosening of a tooth. These could be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor \n\n\n\n78\n\nand dentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic Acid\nHospira or after stopping treatment.\n\u2212 Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for \npostmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this irregular heart \nrhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have \nreceived zoledronic acid.\n\u2212 Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat.\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\nAs a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to \nhypocalcaemia).\n\uf02d A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your \n\ndoctor with certain urine tests).\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n\u2212 As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular, seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to \nhypocalcaemia).\n\u2212 Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These could \nbe signs of bone damage in the ear.\n\u2212 Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially the \nhip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or \nworsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira or after \nstopping treatment.\n\nTell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\u2212 Low level of phosphate in the blood.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\u2212 Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, \nfatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and bone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific \ntreatment is required and the\nsymptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days).\n\u2212 Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite.\n\u2212 Conjunctivitis.\n\u2212 Low level of red blood cells (anaemia).\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n\u2212 Hypersensitivity reactions.\n\u2212 Low blood pressure.\n\u2212 Chest pain.\n\u2212 Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching.\n\u2212 High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste disturbances, \n\ntrembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dry \nmouth.\n\n\u2212 Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets.\n\u2212 Low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood.

Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from\nparticles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the \npreparation of the infusion.\n\n- From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C. The refrigerated solution should then be \nequilibrated to room temperature prior to administration.\n\n\u2212 The solution containing zoledronic acid must not be further diluted or mixed with other infusion \nsolutions. It is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a separate infusion line. The \nhydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following administration of zoledronic acid \nto ensure that they are adequately hydrated.\n\n- Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion can be used immediately without further \npreparation  for patients with normal renal function. In patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment, reduced doses should be prepared as instructed below.\n\nTo prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr \u2264 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. \nRemove the volume of Zoledronic Acid Hospira solution indicated from the bag prior to \nadministration. \n\n\n\n82\n\nTable 1: Preparation of reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion \n\nBaseline creatinine clearance \n(ml/min) \n\nRemove the following amount \nof Zoledronic Acid Hospira \n4 mg/100 ml solution for \ninfusion (ml) \n\nAdjusted dose (mg zoledronic \nacid) *\n\n50-60 12.0 3.5\n40-49 18.0 3.3\n30-39 25.0 3.0\n\n* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg\u2022hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The \nreduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in \npatients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min.\n\n\u2212 Studies with several types of infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and\npolypropylene showed no incompatibility with zoledronic acid.\n\n\u2212 Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zoledronic Acid Hospira with other intravenously \nadministered substances, Zoledronic Acid Hospira must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts/substances and should always be given through a separate infusion line.\n\nHow to store Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n\n\u2212 Keep Zoledronic Acid Hospira out of the reach and sight of children.\n\u2212 Do not use Zoledronic Acid Hospira after the expiry date stated on the pack.\n\u2212 The bag does not require any specific storage conditions.\n\n\n\n83\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira 5 mg/100 ml solution for infusion \nZoledronic acid\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Zoledronic Acid Hospira is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n3. How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Zoledronic Acid Hospira is and what it is used for\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira contains the active substance zoledronic acid. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat Paget\u2019s disease of the bone in adults. \n\nIt is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. This process is called \nremodelling. In Paget\u2019s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered \nfashion, which makes it weaker than normal. If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed \nand painful, and may break. Zoledronic Acid Hospira works by returning the bone remodelling \nprocess to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone. \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira\n\nFollow all instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse carefully before you are given \nZoledronic Acid Hospira. \n\nYou must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira:\n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low). \n- if you have severe kidney problems.\n- if you are pregnant. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira: \n- if you are being treated with any medicine containing zoledronic acid, which is also the active \nsubstance of Zoledronic Acid Hospira (zoledronic acid is used in adult patients with certain types of \ncancer to prevent bone complications or to reduce the amount of calcium).\n- if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one. \n- if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements. \n- if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed. \n- if you have had sections of your intestine removed. \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported in the \n\n\n\n84\n\npost-marketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid for osteoporosis. ONJ can also occur after \nstopping treatment.\n\nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. \nIn order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you \nshould take.\n\nBefore receiving Zoledronic Acid Hospira, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if\n- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction;\n- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time;\n- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems);\n- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders);\n- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone)\n- you have cancer.\n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Zoledronic \nAcid Hospira.\n\nWhile being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including \nregular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make \nsure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery (e.g. \ntooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are \nbeing treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you \nexperience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing \nof sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\nMonitoring test\nYour doctor should do a blood test to check your kidney function (levels of creatinine) before each \ndose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such as \nwater), within a few hours before receiving Zoledronic Acid Hospira, as directed by your healthcare \nprovider.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nZoledronic Acid Hospira is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age. The use of Zoledronic \nAcid Hospira in children and adolescents has not been studied. \n\nOther medicines and Zoledronic Acid Hospira\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nIt is especially important for your doctor to know all the medicines you are taking, especially if you \nare taking any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys (e.g. aminoglycosides) or diuretics \n(\u201cwaterpills\u201d) that may cause dehydration. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may \nbe pregnant or are planning to have a baby. \n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy while taking Zoledronic Acid Hospira, do not drive or use machines until you feel \nbetter. \n\n\n\n85\n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given\n\nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse. Check with your doctor or nurse \nif you are not sure. \n\nThe usual dose is 5 mg, given to you as one single infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The \ninfusion will take at least 15 minutes. Zoledronic Acid Hospira may work for longer than one year, \nand your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again. \n\nYour doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (e.g. tablets) for at least the \nfirst ten days after being given Zoledronic Acid Hospira. It is important that you follow this advice \ncarefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the \ninfusion. Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia. \n\nZoledronic Acid Hospira with food and drink\nMake sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with \nZoledronic Acid Hospira, as directed by your doctor. This will help to prevent dehydration. You may \neat normally on the day you are treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. This is especially important in \npatients who take diuretics (\u201cwater pills\u201d) and in elderly patients.\n\nIf you missed a dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira\nContact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. \n\nBefore stopping Zoledronic Acid Hospira therapy \nIf you are considering stopping Zoledronic Acid Hospira treatment, please go to your next \nappointment and discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you \nshould be treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSide effects related to the first infusion are very common (occurring in more than 30% of patients) but \nare less common following subsequent infusions. The majority of the side effects, such as fever and \nchills, pain in the muscles or joints, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose \nof Zoledronic Acid Hospira. The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three \ndays. Your doctor can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce \nthese side effects. The chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of \nZoledronic Acid Hospira. \n\nSome side effects could be serious\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\nIrregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for the \ntreatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this \nirregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after \nyou have received Zoledronic Acid Hospira.\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n\nSwelling, redness, pain and itching to the eyes or eye sensitivity to light.\n\n\n\n86\n\nVery Rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people)\nTalk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These could \nbe signs of bone damage in the ear. \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)\nPain in the mouth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness \nor a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth, these could be signs of bone damage in the \njaw (osteonecrosis).

carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with zoledronic acid hospira and will check your response to treatment at regular intervals. you should not be given zoledronic acid hospira: \u2212 if you are breast-feeding. \u2212 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which zoledronic acid belongs), or any of the other ingredients of zoledronic acid hospira (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before being given zoledronic acid hospira: \u2212 if you have or have had a kidney problem. \u2212 if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or loosening of a tooth. your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start treatment with zoledronic acid hospira if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with zoledronic acid hospira and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. while being treated with zoledronic acid hospira, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to severe hypocalcaemia. in some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. if any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. if you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be corrected before initiating the first dose of zoledronic acid hospira. you will be given adequate calcium and vitamin d supplements. patients aged 65 years and over zoledronic acid hospira can be given to people aged 65 years and over. there is no evidence to suggest that any extra precautions are needed. children and adolescents zoledronic acid hospira is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 years. other medicines and zoledronic acid hospira please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. it is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become too low. thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any other medicines which may harm your kidneys. any other medicines that contain zoledronic acid which is used to treat osteoporosis and other non- cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of these medicines taken together with zoledronic acid hospira are unknown. - anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with zoledronic acid hospira has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (onj). pregnancy and breast-feeding you should not be given zoledronic acid hospira if you are pregnant. tell your doctor if you are or think that you may be pregnant. you must not be given zoledronic acid hospira if you are breast-feeding. ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. driving and using machines there have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of zoledronic acid hospira. you should therefore be careful when driving, using machines or performing other tasks that need full attention. zoledronic acid hospira contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \"sodium-free\".", "Entity_Recognition":

drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent dehydration. carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. how much zoledronic acid hospira is given the usual single dose given is 4 mg. if you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity of your kidney problem. how often zoledronic acid hospira is given if you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you will be given one infusion of zoledronic acid hospira every three to four weeks. if you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only be given one infusion of zoledronic acid hospira. how zoledronic acid hospira is given zoledronic acid hospira is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin d supplements to be taken each day. if you are given more zoledronic acid hospira than you should be if you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your doctor. this is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney impairment. if your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by infusion.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zoledronic

effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, zoledronic acid hospira can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. the most common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. tell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \u2212 severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific blood tests). \u2212 low level of calcium in the blood. uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \u2212 pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or loosening of a tooth. these could be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while being treated with zoledronic acid hospira or after stopping treatment. \u2212 irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for postmenopausal osteoporosis. it is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received zoledronic acid. \u2212 severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): as a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to hypocalcaemia). a kidney function disorder called fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain urine tests). very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \u2212 as a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to hypocalcaemia). \u2212 talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. these could be signs of bone damage in the ear. \u2212 osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially the hip or thigh. tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with zoledronic acid hospira or after stopping treatment. tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\u2212 low level of phosphate in the blood. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \u2212 headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and bone, joint and/or muscle ache. in most cases no specific treatment is required and the symptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). \u2212 gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. \u2212 conjunctivitis. \u2212 low level of red blood cells (anaemia). uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \u2212 hypersensitivity reactions. \u2212 low blood pressure. \u2212 chest pain. \u2212 skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. \u2212 high blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste disturbances, trembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dry mouth. \u2212 low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets. \u2212 low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. your doctor will monitor this and take any necessary measures. \u2212 weight increase \u2212 increased sweating \u2212 sleepiness \u2212 blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light. \u2212 sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse. \u2212 difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing. \u2212 urticaria. rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \u2212 slow heart beat. \u2212 confusion. \u2212 unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for osteoporosis may occur rarely. contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone. interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs) 71 flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \u2212 fainting due to low blood pressure. \u2212 severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain, occasionally incapacitating. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting
