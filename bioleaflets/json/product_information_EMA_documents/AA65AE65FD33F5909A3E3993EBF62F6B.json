QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nSignifor 0.3 mg solution for injection \nOne ampoule of 1 ml contains 0.3 mg pasireotide (as pasireotide diaspartate). \n \nSignifor 0.6 mg solution for injection \nOne ampoule of 1 ml contains 0.6 mg pasireotide (as pasireotide diaspartate). \n \nSignifor 0.9 mg solution for injection \nOne ampoule of 1 ml contains 0.9 mg pasireotide (as pasireotide diaspartate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom \nsurgery has failed. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 0.6 mg pasireotide by subcutaneous injection twice a day. \n \nTwo months after the start of Signifor therapy, patients should be evaluated for clinical benefit. \nPatients who experience a significant reduction in urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels should continue to \nreceive Signifor for as long as benefit is derived. A dose increase to 0.9 mg may be considered based \non the response to the treatment, as long as the 0.6 mg dose is well tolerated by the patient. Patients \nwho have not responded to Signifor after two months of treatment should be considered for \ndiscontinuation. \n \nManagement of suspected adverse reactions at any time during the treatment may require temporary \ndose reduction of Signifor. Dose reduction by decrements of 0.3 mg twice a day is suggested. \n \nIf a dose of Signifor is missed, the next injection should be administered at the scheduled time. Doses \nshould not be doubled to make up for a missed dose. \n \nSwitch from intramuscular to subcutaneous formulation \n\n \nThere are no clinical data available on switching from the intramuscular to the subcutaneous \n\n\n\n3 \n\npasireotide formulation. If such a switch should be required, it is recommended to maintain an interval \nof at least 28 days between the last intramuscular injection and the first subcutaneous injection, and to \ninitiate the subcutaneous injections at a dose of 0.6 mg pasireotide twice a day. The patient should be \nmonitored for response and tolerability and further dose adjustments may be needed. \n \nSpecial populations \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Signifor in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly patients (≥65 years) \nData on the use of Signifor in patients older than 65 years are limited, but there is no evidence to \nsuggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mildly impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh A). The \nrecommended initial dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) is 0.3 mg \ntwice a day (see section 5.2). The maximum recommended dose for these patients is 0.6 mg twice a \nday. Signifor should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSignifor is to be administered subcutaneously by self injection. Patients should receive instructions \nfrom the physician or a healthcare professional on how to inject Signifor subcutaneously. \n \nUse of the same injection site for two consecutive injections is not recommended. Sites showing signs \nof inflammation or irritation should be avoided. Preferred injection sites for subcutaneous injections \nare the top of the thighs and the abdomen (excluding the navel or waistline). \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nGlucose metabolism \n \nAlterations in blood glucose levels have been frequently reported in healthy volunteers and patients \ntreated with pasireotide. Hyperglycaemia and, less frequently, hypoglycaemia, were observed in \nsubjects participating in clinical studies with pasireotide (see section 4.8). \n \nThe degree of hyperglycaemia appeared to be higher in patients with pre-diabetic conditions or \nestablished diabetes mellitus. During the pivotal study, HbA1c levels increased significantly and \nstabilised but did not return to baseline values (see section 4.8). More cases of discontinuation and a \nhigher reporting rate of severe adverse events due to hyperglycaemia were reported in patients treated \nwith the dose of 0.9 mg twice daily. \n \nThe development of hyperglycaemia appears to be related to decreases in secretion of insulin \n\n\n\n4 \n\n(particularly in the post-dose period) and of incretin hormones (i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] \nand glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]). \n \nGlycaemic status (fasting plasma glucose/haemoglobin A1c [FPG/HbA1c]) should be assessed prior to \nstarting treatment with pasireotide. FPG/HbA1c monitoring during treatment should follow established \nguidelines. Self monitoring of blood glucose and/or FPG assessments should be done weekly for the \nfirst two to three months and periodically thereafter, as clinically appropriate, as well as over the first \ntwo to four weeks after any dose increase. In addition, monitoring of FPG 4 weeks and HbA1c \n3 months after the end of the treatment should be performed. \n \nIf hyperglycaemia develops in a patient being treated with Signifor, the initiation or adjustment of \nantidiabetic treatment is recommended, following the established treatment guidelines for the \nmanagement of hyperglycaemia. If uncontrolled hyperglycaemia persists despite appropriate medical \nmanagement, the dose of Signifor should be reduced or Signifor treatment discontinued (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nThere have been post-marketing cases of ketoacidosis with Signifor in patients with and without a \nhistory of diabetes. Patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic \nacidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of diabetes history. \n \nIn patients with poor glycaemic control (as defined by HbA1c values >8% while receiving anti-diabetic \ntherapy), diabetes management and monitoring should be intensified prior to initiation and during \npasireotide therapy. \n \nLiver tests \n \nMild transient elevations in aminotransferases are commonly observed in patients treated with \npasireotide. Rare cases of concurrent elevations in ALT (alanine aminotransferase) greater than \n3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN have also been observed (see section 4.8). Monitoring of \nliver function is recommended prior to treatment with pasireotide and after one, two, four, eight and \ntwelve weeks during treatment. Thereafter liver function should be monitored as clinically indicated. \n \nPatients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a second liver function \nevaluation to confirm the finding. If the finding is confirmed, the patient should be followed with \nfrequent liver function monitoring until values return to pre-treatment levels. Therapy with pasireotide \nshould be discontinued if the patient develops jaundice or other signs suggestive of clinically \nsignificant liver dysfunction, in the event of a sustained increase in AST (aspartate aminotransferase) \nor ALT of 5 x ULN or greater, or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 x ULN occur concurrently \nwith bilirubin elevations greater than 2 x ULN. Following discontinuation of treatment with \npasireotide, patients should be monitored until resolution. Treatment should not be restarted. \n \nCardiovascular related events \n \nBradycardia has been reported with the use of pasireotide (see section 4.8). Careful monitoring is \nrecommended in patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of \nclinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial infarction, high-grade heart block, congestive \nheart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular \nfibrillation. Dose adjustment of medicinal products such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or \nmedicinal products to control electrolyte balance, may be necessary (see also section 4.5). \n \nPasireotide has been shown to prolong the QT interval on the ECG in two dedicated healthy volunteer \nstudies. The clinical significance of this prolongation is unknown. \n \nIn clinical studies in Cushing’s disease patients, QTcF of >500 msec was observed in two out of \n201 patients. These episodes were sporadic and of single occurrence with no clinical consequence \nobserved. Episodes of torsade de pointes were not observed either in those studies or in clinical studies \nin other patient populations. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPasireotide should be used with caution and the benefit risk carefully weighed in patients who are at \nsignificant risk of developing prolongation of QT, such as those: \n- with congenital long QT syndrome. \n- with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, \n\ncongestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. \n- taking antiarrhythmic medicinal products or other substances that are known to lead to QT \n\nprolongation (see section 4.5). \n- with hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia. \n \nMonitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable and ECG should be performed prior to the \nstart of Signifor therapy, one week after the beginning of the treatment and as clinically indicated \nthereafter. Hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to administration of \nSignifor and should be monitored periodically during therapy. \n \nHypocortisolism \n \nTreatment with Signifor leads to rapid suppression of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) secretion \nin Cushing’s disease patients. Rapid, complete or near-complete suppression of ACTH may lead to a \ndecrease in circulating levels of cortisol and potentially to transient hypocortisolism/hypoadrenalism. \n \nIt is therefore necessary to monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with \nhypocortisolism (e.g. weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyperkalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia). In the event of documented hypocortisolism, temporary exogenous \nsteroid (glucocorticoid) replacement therapy and/or dose reduction or interruption of Signifor therapy \nmay be necessary. \n \nGallbladder and related events \n \nCholelithiasis (gallstones) is a recognised adverse reaction associated with long-term use of \nsomatostatin analogues and has frequently been reported in clinical studies with pasireotide (see \nsection 4.8). There have been post-marketing cases of cholangitis in patients taking Signifor, which in \nthe majority of cases was reported as a complication of gallstones. Ultrasonic examination of the \ngallbladder before and at 6 to 12 month intervals during Signifor therapy is therefore recommended. \nThe presence of gallstones in Signifor-treated patients is largely asymptomatic; symptomatic stones \nshould be managed according to clinical practice. \n \nPituitary hormones \n \nAs the pharmacological activity of pasireotide mimics that of somatostatin, inhibition of pituitary \nhormones other than ACTH cannot be ruled out. Monitoring of pituitary function (e.g. TSH/free T4, \nGH/IGF-1) before and periodically during Signifor therapy should therefore be considered, as \nclinically appropriate. \n \nEffect on female fertility \n \nThe therapeutic benefits of a reduction or normalisation of serum cortisol levels in female patients \nwith Cushing’s disease could potentially restore fertility. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment with Signifor (see section 4.6). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the increase in unbound drug exposure, Signifor should be used with caution in patients with \nsevere renal impairment or end stage renal disease (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAnticipated pharmacokinetic interactions resulting in effects on pasireotide \n \n\nThe influence of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous pasireotide \nwas tested in a drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers. No change in the pharmacokinetics \n(rate or extent of exposure) of pasireotide was observed. \n \nAnticipated pharmacokinetic interactions resulting in effects on other medicinal products \n \nPasireotide may decrease the relative bioavailability of ciclosporin. Concomitant administration of \npasireotide and ciclosporin may require adjustment of the ciclosporin dose to maintain therapeutic \nlevels. \n \nAnticipated pharmacodynamic interactions \n \nMedicinal products that prolong the QT interval \nPasireotide should be used with caution in patients who are concomitantly receiving medicinal \nproducts that prolong the QT interval, such as class Ia antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, \ndisopyramide), class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide), \ncertain antibacterials (intravenous erythromycin, pentamidine injection, clarithromycin, moxifloxacin), \ncertain antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol, \ntiapride, amisulpride, sertindole, methadone), certain antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, \nmizolastine), antimalarials (e.g. chloroquine, halofantrine, lumefantrine), certain antifungals \n(ketoconazole, except in shampoo) (see also section 4.4). \n \nBradycardic medicinal products \nClinical monitoring of heart rate, notably at the beginning of treatment, is recommended in patients \nreceiving pasireotide concomitantly with bradycardic medicinal products, such as beta blockers (e.g. \nmetoprolol, carteolol, propranolol, sotalol), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. rivastigmine, \nphysostigmine), certain calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil), certain \nantiarrhythmics (see also section 4.4). \n \nInsulin and antidiabetic medicinal products \nDose adjustments (decrease or increase) of insulin and antidiabetic medicinal products (e.g. \nmetformin, liraglutide, vildagliptin, nateglinide) may be required when administered concomitantly \nwith pasireotide (see also section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of pasireotide in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pasireotide is not recommended for use during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential who are not using contraception (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pasireotide is excreted in human milk. Available data in rats have shown \nexcretion of pasireotide in milk (see section 5.3). Breast-feeding should be discontinued during \ntreatment with Signifor. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \n \nStudies in rats have shown effects on female reproductive parameters (see section 5.3). The clinical \nrelevance of these effects in humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nSignifor may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nadvised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue, dizziness or \nheadache during treatment with Signifor. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nA total of 201 Cushing’s disease patients received Signifor in phase II and III studies. The safety \nprofile of Signifor was consistent with the somatostatin analogue class, except for the occurrence of \nhypocortisolism and degree of hyperglycaemia. \n \nThe data described below reflect exposure of 162 Cushing’s disease patients to Signifor in the \nphase III study. At study entry patients were randomised to receive twice-daily doses of either 0.6 mg \nor 0.9 mg Signifor. The mean age of patients was approximately 40 years and the majority of patients \n(77.8%) were female. Most (83.3%) patients had persistent or recurrent Cushing’s disease and few \n(≤5%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median exposure to \nthe treatment up to the cut-off date of the primary efficacy and safety analysis was 10.37 months \n(0.03-37.8), with 66.0% of patients having at least six months’ exposure. \n \nGrade 1 and 2 adverse reactions were reported in 57.4% of patients. Grade 3 adverse reactions were \nobserved in 35.8% of patients and Grade 4 adverse reactions in 2.5% of patients. Grade 3 and 4 \nadverse reactions were mostly related to hyperglycaemia. The most common adverse reactions \n(incidence ≥10%) were diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, cholelithiasis, injection site reactions, \nhyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, fatigue and glycosylated haemoglobin increased. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported up to the cut-off date of the analysis are presented in Table 1. Adverse \nreactions are listed according to MedDRA primary system organ class. Within each system organ \nclass, adverse reactions are ranked by frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions \nare presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies were defined as follows: Very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions in the phase III study and from post-marketing experience in \n\nCushing’s disease patients \n\n \nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia  \n\nEndocrine \n\ndisorders \n Adrenal \n\ninsufficiency \n  \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nHyperglycaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus \n\nDecreased \nappetite, type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus, \nglucose tolerance \nimpaired \n\n Diabetic \nketoacidosis \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n Headache, \n\ndizziness \n  \n\nCardiac \n\ndisorders \n Sinus \n\nbradycardia, QT \nprolongation \n\n  \n\nVascular \n\ndisorders \n\n Hypotension   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \nDiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \nnausea \n\nVomiting, \nabdominal pain \nupper \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders \nCholelithiasis Cholecystitis *, \n\ncholestasis \n  \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n Alopecia, pruritus   \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\n Myalgia, \narthralgia \n\n  \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nreaction, fatigue \n\n   \n\nInvestigations Glycosylated \nhaemoglobin \nincreased \n\nGamma \nglutamyltransfera\nse increased, \nalanine \naminotransferase \nincreased, \naspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased, lipase \nincreased, blood \nglucose \nincreased, blood \namylase \nincreased, \nprothrombin time \nprolonged \n\n  \n\n* Cholecystitis includes cholecystitis acute \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGlucose metabolism disorders \nElevated glucose was the most frequently reported Grade 3 laboratory abnormality (23.2% of patients) \nin the phase III study in Cushing’s disease patients. Mean HbA1c increases were less pronounced in \npatients with normal glycaemia (n=62 overall) at study entry (i.e. 5.29% and 5.22% at baseline and \n6.50% and 6.75% at month 6 for the 0.6 and 0.9 mg twice daily dose groups, respectively) relative to \npre-diabetic patients (i.e. n=38 overall; 5.77% and 5.71% at baseline and 7.45% and 7.13% at \nmonth 6) or diabetic patients (i.e. n=54 overall; 6.50% and 6.42% at baseline and 7.95% and 8.30% at \nmonth 6). Mean fasting plasma glucose levels commonly increased within the first month of treatment, \nwith decreases and stabilisation observed in subsequent months. Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c \nvalues generally decreased over the 28 days following pasireotide discontinuation but remained above \nbaseline values. Long-term follow-up data are not available. Patients with baseline HbA1c ≥7% or who \nwere taking antidiabetic medicinal products prior to randomisation tended to have higher mean \nchanges in fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c relative to other patients. Adverse reactions of \nhyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus led to study discontinuation in 5 (3.1%) and 4 (2.5%) patients, \nrespectively. One case of ketosis and one case of ketoacidosis have been reported during \ncompassionate use of Signifor. \n \nMonitoring of blood glucose levels in patients treated with Signifor is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders were frequently reported with Signifor. These reactions were usually of low \ngrade, required no intervention and improved with continued treatment. \n \nInjection site reactions \nInjection site reactions were reported in 13.6% of patients enrolled in the phase III study in Cushing’s \ndisease. Injection site reactions were also reported in clinical studies in other populations. The \nreactions were most frequently reported as local pain, erythema, haematoma, haemorrhage and \npruritus. These reactions resolved spontaneously and required no intervention. \n \nLiver enzymes \nTransient elevations in liver enzymes have been reported with the use of somatostatin analogues and \nwere also observed in patients receiving pasireotide in clinical studies. The elevations were mostly \nasymptomatic, of low grade and reversible with continued treatment. Rare cases of concurrent \nelevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN have been observed. All \ncases of concurrent elevations were identified within ten days of initiation of treatment with Signifor. \nThe patients recovered without clinical sequelae and liver function test results returned to baseline \nvalues after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nMonitoring of liver enzymes is recommended before and during treatment with Signifor (see \nsection 4.4), as clinically appropriate. \n \nPancreatic enzymes \nAsymptomatic elevations in lipase and amylase were observed in patients receiving pasireotide in \nclinical studies. The elevations were mostly low grade and reversible while continuing treatment. \nPancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of somatostatin analogues due to the \nassociation between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 2.1 mg twice a day have been used in healthy volunteers, with the adverse reaction \ndiarrhoea being observed at a high frequency. \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment be initiated, as \ndictated by the patient’s clinical status, until resolution of the symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatostatin and \nanalogues, ATC code: H01CB05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPasireotide is a novel cyclohexapeptide, injectable somatostatin analogue. Like the natural peptide \nhormones somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 (also known as somatotropin release inhibiting factor \n[SRIF]) and other somatostatin analogues, pasireotide exerts its pharmacological activity via binding \nto somatostatin receptors. Five human somatostatin receptor subtypes are known: hsst1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. \nThese receptor subtypes are expressed in different tissues under normal physiological conditions. \nSomatostatin analogues bind to hsst receptors with different potencies (see Table 2). Pasireotide binds \nwith high affinity to four of the five hssts. \n \nTable 2 Binding affinities of somatostatin (SRIF-14), pasireotide, octreotide and lanreotide \n\nto the five human somatostatin receptor subtypes (hsst1-5) \n\n \nCompound hsst1 hsst2 hsst3 hsst4 hsst5 \n\nSomatostatin \n(SRIF-14) \n\n0.930.12 0.150.02 0.560.17 1.50.4 0.290.04 \n\nPasireotide 9.30.1 1.00.1 1.50.3 >1,000 0.160.01 \nOctreotide 28080 0.380.08 7.11.4 >1,000 6.31.0 \nLanreotide 18020 0.540.08 149 23040 175 \n\nResults are the meanSEM of IC50 values expressed as nmol/l. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatostatin receptors are expressed in many tissues, especially in neuroendocrine tumours in which \nhormones are excessively secreted, including ACTH in Cushing’s disease. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that corticotroph tumour cells from Cushing’s disease patients display a \nhigh expression of hsst5, whereas the other receptor subtypes either are not expressed or are expressed \nat lower levels. Pasireotide binds and activates four of the five hssts, especially hsst5, in corticotrophs \nof ACTH-producing adenomas, resulting in inhibition of ACTH secretion. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nA phase III, multicentre, randomised study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of \ndifferent dose levels of Signifor over a twelve-month treatment period in Cushing’s disease patients \nwith persistent or recurrent disease or de novo patients for whom surgery was not indicated or who \nrefused surgery. \n \nThe study enrolled 162 patients with a baseline UFC >1.5 x ULN who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio \nto receive a subcutaneous dose of either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg Signifor twice daily. After three months of \n\n\n\n11 \n\ntreatment, patients with a mean 24-hour UFC ≤2 x ULN and below or equal to their baseline value \ncontinued blinded treatment at the randomised dose until month 6. Patients who did not meet these \ncriteria were unblinded and the dose was increased by 0.3 mg twice daily. After the initial 6 months in \nthe study, patients entered an additional 6-month open-label treatment period. If response was not \nachieved at month 6 or if the response was not maintained during the open-label treatment period, \ndosage could be increased by 0.3 mg twice daily. The dose could be reduced by decrements of 0.3 mg \ntwice daily at any time during the study for reasons of intolerability. \n \nThe primary efficacy end-point was the proportion of patients in each arm who achieved normalisation \nof mean 24-hour UFC levels (UFC ≤ULN) after 6 months of treatment and who did not have a dose \nincrease (relative to randomised dose) during this period. Secondary end-points included, among \nothers, changes from baseline in: 24-hour UFC, plasma ACTH, serum cortisol levels, and clinical \nsigns and symptoms of Cushing’s disease. All analyses were conducted based on the randomised dose \ngroups. \n \nBaseline demographics were well balanced between the two randomised dose groups and consistent \nwith the epidemiology of the disease. The mean age of patients was approximately 40 years and the \nmajority of patients (77.8%) were female. Most patients (83.3%) had persistent or recurrent Cushing’s \ndisease and few (≤5%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. \n \nBaseline characteristics were balanced between the two randomised dose groups, except for marked \ndifferences in the mean value of baseline 24-hour UFC (1156 nmol/24 h for the 0.6 mg twice daily \ngroup and 782 nmol/24 h for the 0.9 mg twice daily group; normal range 30-145 nmol/24 h). \n \nResults \nAt month 6, normalisation of mean UFC levels was observed in 14.6% (95% CI 7.0-22.3) and 26.3% \n(95% CI 16.6-35.9) of patients randomised to pasireotide 0.6 mg and 0.9 mg twice daily, respectively. \nThe study met the primary efficacy objective for the 0.9 mg twice-daily group as the lower limit of the \n95% CI is greater than the pre-specified 15% boundary. The response in the 0.9 mg dose arm seemed \nto be higher for patients with lower mean UFC at baseline. The responder rate at month 12 was \ncomparable to month 6, with 13.4% and 25.0% in the 0.6 mg and 0.9 mg twice-daily groups, \nrespectively. \n \nA supportive efficacy analysis was conducted in which patients were further classified into 3 response \ncategories regardless of up-titration at month 3: Fully controlled (UFC ≤1.0 x ULN), partially \ncontrolled (UFC >1.0 x ULN but with a reduction in UFC ≥50% compared to baseline) or \nuncontrolled (reduction in UFC <50%). The total proportion of patients with either full or partial mean \nUFC control at month 6 was 34% and 41% of the randomised patients to the 0.6 mg and 0.9 mg dose, \nrespectively. Patients uncontrolled at both month 1 and month 2 are likely (90%) to remain \nuncontrolled at months 6 and 12. \n \nIn both dose groups, Signifor resulted in a decrease in mean UFC after 1 month of treatment which \nwas maintained over time. \n \nDecreases were also demonstrated by the overall percentage of change in mean and median UFC \nlevels at month 6 and 12 as compared to baseline values (see Table 3). Reductions in plasma ACTH \nlevels were also observed at each time point for each dose group. \n \nTable 3 Percentage change in mean and median UFC levels per randomised dose group at \n\n\n\n12 \n\nmonth 6 and month 12 compared to baseline values \n\n \n Pasireotide 0.6 mg twice \n\ndaily \n% change (n) \n\nPasireotide 0.9 mg twice \ndaily \n\n% change (n) \nMean change in UFC \n(% from baseline) \n\nMonth 6 -27.5* (52) -48.4 (51) \nMonth 12 -41.3 (37) -54.5 (35) \n\nMedian change in UFC \n(% from baseline) \n\nMonth 6 -47.9 (52) -47.9 (51) \nMonth 12 -67.6 (37) -62.4 (35) \n\n* Includes one patient with significant outlying results who had a percent change from baseline of \n+542.2%. \n\n \nDecreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol \nwere observed in both dose groups at month 6. Overall reductions in these parameters were observed \nin patients with full and partial mean UFC control but tended to be greater in patients with normalised \nUFC. Similar trends were observed at month 12. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSignifor in all subsets of the paediatric population in pituitary-dependant Cushing’s disease, \noverproduction of pituitary ACTH and pituitary dependant hyperadrenocorticism (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nIn healthy volunteers, pasireotide is rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentration is reached within \n0.25-0.5 h. Cmax and AUC are approximately dose-proportional following administration of single and \nmultiple doses. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the bioavailability of pasireotide in humans. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn healthy volunteers, pasireotide is widely distributed with large apparent volume of distribution \n(Vz/F >100 litres). Distribution between blood cells and plasma is concentration independent and \nshows that pasireotide is primarily located in the plasma (91%). Plasma protein binding is moderate \n(88%) and independent of concentration. \n \nBased on in vitro data pasireotide appears to be a substrate of efflux transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein). \nBased on in vitro data pasireotide is not a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer \nresistance protein) nor of the influx transporters OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), OATP (organic \nanion-transporting polypeptide) 1B1, 1B3 or 2B1. At therapeutic dose levels pasireotide is also not an \ninhibitor of UGT1A1, OATP, 1B1 or 1B3, P-gp, BCRP, MRP2 and BSEP. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPasireotide is metabolically highly stable and in vitro data show that pasireotide is not a substrate, \ninhibitor or inducer of any major enzymes of CYP450. In healthy volunteers, pasireotide is \npredominantly found in unchanged form in plasma, urine and faeces. \n \nElimination \n \nPasireotide is eliminated mainly via hepatic clearance (biliary excretion), with a small contribution of \nthe renal route. In a human ADME study 55.9±6.63% of the radioactive dose was recovered over the \n\n\n\n13 \n\nfirst 10 days after administration, including 48.3±8.16% of the radioactivity in faeces and 7.63±2.03% \nin urine. \n \nPasireotide demonstrates low clearance (CL/F ~7.6 litres/h for healthy volunteers and ~3.8 litres/h for \nCushing’s disease patients). Based on the accumulation ratios of AUC, the calculated effective \nhalf-life (t1/2,eff) in healthy volunteers was approximately 12 hours. \n \nLinearity and time dependency \n \nIn Cushing’s disease patients, pasireotide demonstrates linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics \nin the dose range of 0.3 mg to 1.2 mg twice a day. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that \nbased on Cmax and AUC, 90% of steady state in Cushing’s disease patients is reached after \napproximately 1.5 and 15 days, respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been performed in paediatric patients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nRenal clearance has a minor contribution to the elimination of pasireotide in humans. In a clinical \nstudy with single subcutaneous dose administration of 900 µg pasireotide in subjects with impaired \nrenal function, renal impairment of mild, moderate or severe degree, or end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) did not have a significant impact on total pasireotide plasma exposure. The unbound plasma \npasireotide exposure (AUCinf,u) was increased in subjects with renal impairment (mild: 33%; moderate: \n25%, severe: 99%, ESRD: 143%) compared to control subjects. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn a clinical study in subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh A, B and C), statistically \nsignificant differences were found in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh B and C). In subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, AUCinf was \nincreased 60% and 79%, Cmax was increased 67% and 69%, and CL/F was decreased 37% and 44%, \nrespectively. \n \nElderly patients (≥65 years) \nAge has been found to be a covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of Cushing’s disease \npatients. Decreased total body clearance and increased pharmacokinetic exposures have been seen \nwith increasing age. In the studied age range 18-73 years, the area under the curve at steady state for \none dosing interval of 12 hours (AUCss) is predicted to range from 86% to 111% of that of the typical \npatient of 41 years. This variation is moderate and considered of minor significance considering the \nwide age range in which the effect was observed. \n \nData on Cushing’s disease patients older than 65 years are limited but do not suggest any clinically \nsignificant differences in safety and efficacy in relation to younger patients. \n \nDemographics \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses of Signifor suggest that race and gender do not influence \npharmacokinetic parameters. \n \nBody weight has been found to be a covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of Cushing’s \ndisease patients. For a range of 60-100 kg the reduction in AUCss with increasing weight is predicted \nto be approximately 27%, which is considered moderate and of minor clinical significance. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\n\n\n14 \n\nand development. Most findings seen in repeated toxicity studies were reversible and attributable to \nthe pharmacology of pasireotide. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures \nconsidered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to \nclinical use. \n \nPasireotide was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies conducted in rats and transgenic mice did not identify any carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nPasireotide did not affect fertility in male rats but, as expected from the pharmacology of pasireotide, \nfemales presented abnormal cycles or acyclicity, and decreased numbers of corpora lutea and \nimplantation sites. Embryo toxicity was seen in rats and rabbits at doses that caused maternal toxicity \nbut no teratogenic potential was detected. In the pre- and postnatal study in rats, pasireotide had no \neffects on labour and delivery, but caused slight retardation in the development of pinna detachment \nand reduced body weight of the offspring. \n \nAvailable toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of pasireotide in milk. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with acromegaly for whom surgery is not an option or has not been \ncurative and who are inadequately controlled on treatment with another somatostatin analogue. \n \nTreatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom \nsurgery has failed. \n \nThe 60 mg strength is only to be used in the treatment of acromegaly. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \nPosology \n \nAcromegaly \n\nThe recommended initial dose for the treatment of acromegaly is 40 mg of pasireotide every 4 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe dose may be increased to a maximum of 60 mg for patients whose growth hormone (GH) and/or \ninsulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels are not fully controlled after 3 months of treatment with \nSignifor at 40 mg. \n \nManagement of suspected adverse reactions or over-response to treatment (IGF-1 < lower limit of \nnormal) may require temporary dose reduction of Signifor. The dose may be decreased either \ntemporarily or permanently. \n \nCushing’s disease \n\nThe recommended initial dose for the treatment of Cushing’s disease is 10 mg of pasireotide by deep \nintramuscular injection every 4 weeks. \n \nThe patient should be evaluated for clinical benefit after the first month of treatment and periodically \nthereafter. The dose may be titrated every 2 to 4 months based on response and tolerability. The \nmaximum dose of Signifor in Cushing’s disease is 40 mg every 4 weeks. If no clinical benefit is \nobserved, the patient should be considered for discontinuation. \n \nManagement of suspected adverse reactions or over-response to treatment (cortisol levels < lower \nlimit of normal) may require dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation of Signifor. \n \nSwitch from subcutaneous to intramuscular formulation in Cushing’s disease \n\nThere are no clinical data available on switching from the subcutaneous to the intramuscular \npasireotide formulation. If such a switch should be required, the recommended initial dose for the \ntreatment of Cushing’s disease is 10 mg of pasireotide by deep intramuscular injection every 4 weeks. \nThe patient should be monitored for response and tolerability and further dose adjustments may be \nneeded. \n \nMissed dose \n\nIf a dose of Signifor is missed the missed injection should be administered as soon as possible. The \nnext dose should then be planned for 4 weeks after the injection is administered in order to resume the \nnormal schedule of one dose every 4 weeks. \n \nSpecial populations \n\n \nElderly patients (≥65 years) \n\nData on the use of Signifor in patients older than 65 years are limited, but there is no evidence to \nsuggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mildly impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh A). \n \nAcromegaly: the recommended initial dose for acromegaly patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh B) is 20 mg every 4 weeks, and the maximum recommended dose for these patients is \n40 mg every 4 weeks (see section 5.2). \n \nCushings disease: the recommended initial dose for Cushing’s disease patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child Pugh B) is 10 mg every 4 weeks, and the maximum recommended dose for these \npatients is 20 mg every 4 weeks (see section 5.2). \n \nSignifor should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Signifor in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been \n\n\n\n18 \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSignifor is to be administered by deep intramuscular injection by a trained healthcare professional. \nSignifor suspension must only be prepared immediately before administration. \n \nThe site of repeat intramuscular injections should be alternated between the left and right gluteal \nmuscle. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nGlucose metabolism \n \nAlterations in blood glucose levels have been frequently reported in healthy volunteers and patients \ntreated with pasireotide. Hyperglycaemia and, less frequently, hypoglycaemia, were observed in \nsubjects participating in clinical studies with pasireotide (see section 4.8). \n \nIn patients who developed hyperglycaemia, the condition generally appeared to respond to antidiabetic \ntherapy. Dose reductions or discontinuation of treatment with pasireotide due to hyperglycaemia were \ninfrequent in clinical studies with pasireotide. \n \nThe development of hyperglycaemia appears to be related to decreases in secretion of insulin and of \nincretin hormones (i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic \npolypeptide [GIP]). \n \nGlycaemic status (fasting plasma glucose/haemoglobin A1c [FPG/HbA1c]) should be assessed prior to \nstarting treatment with pasireotide. FPG/HbA1c monitoring during treatment should follow established \nguidelines. Self monitoring of blood glucose and/or FPG assessments should be done weekly for the \nfirst three months and periodically thereafter, as clinically appropriate, as well as over the first four to \nsix weeks after any dose increase. In addition, monitoring of FPG 4 weeks and HbA1c 3 months after \nthe end of the treatment should be performed. \n \nIf hyperglycaemia develops in a patient being treated with Signifor, the initiation or adjustment of \nantidiabetic treatment is recommended, following the established treatment guidelines for the \nmanagement of hyperglycaemia. If uncontrolled hyperglycaemia persists despite appropriate medical \nmanagement, the dose of Signifor should be reduced or Signifor treatment discontinued (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nThere have been post-marketing cases of ketoacidosis with Signifor in patients with and without a \nhistory of diabetes. Patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic \nacidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of diabetes history. \n \nIn patients with poor glycaemic control (as defined by HbA1c values >8% while receiving anti-diabetic \ntherapy), diabetes management and monitoring should be intensified prior to initiation and during \npasireotide therapy. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nLiver tests \n \nMild transient elevations in aminotransferases are commonly observed in patients treated with \npasireotide. Rare cases of concurrent elevations in ALT (alanine aminotransferase) greater than \n3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN have also been observed (see section 4.8). Monitoring of \nliver function is recommended prior to treatment with pasireotide intramuscular use and after the first \ntwo to three weeks, then monthly for three months on treatment. Thereafter liver function should be \nmonitored as clinically indicated. \n \nPatients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored frequently until values return \nto pre-treatment levels. Therapy with pasireotide should be discontinued if the patient develops \njaundice or other signs suggestive of clinically significant liver dysfunction, in the event of a sustained \nincrease in AST (aspartate aminotransferase) or ALT of 5 x ULN or greater, or if ALT or AST \nelevations greater than 3 x ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations greater than 2 x ULN. \nFollowing discontinuation of treatment with pasireotide, patients should be monitored until resolution. \nTreatment should not be restarted if the liver function abnormalities are suspected to be related to \npasireotide. \n \nCardiovascular related events \n \nBradycardia has been reported with the use of pasireotide (see section 4.8). Careful monitoring is \nrecommended in patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of \nclinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial infarction, high-grade heart block, congestive \nheart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular \nfibrillation. Dose adjustment of medicinal products such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or \nmedicinal products to control electrolyte balance, may be necessary (see also section 4.5). \n \nPasireotide has been shown to prolong the QT interval on the ECG in two dedicated healthy volunteer \nstudies performed with the subcutaneous formulation. The clinical significance of this prolongation is \nunknown. The phase III clinical studies in acromegaly patients did not identify any clinically \nmeaningful differences in the QT prolongation events between pasireotide intramuscular use and the \nsomatostatin analogues which were tested as active comparator. All QT-related events were transient \nand resolved without therapeutic intervention. \n \nEpisodes of torsade de pointes were not observed in any clinical study with pasireotide. \n \nPasireotide should be used with caution and the benefit risk carefully weighed in patients who are at \nsignificant risk of developing prolongation of QT, such as those: \n- with congenital long QT syndrome. \n- with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, \n\ncongestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. \n- taking antiarrhythmic medicinal products or other substances that are known to lead to QT \n\nprolongation (see section 4.5). \n- with hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia. \n \nA baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with Signifor. Monitoring for an effect on \nthe QTc interval is advisable 21 days after the beginning of the treatment and as clinically indicated \nthereafter. Hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to administration of \nSignifor and should be monitored periodically during therapy. \n \nHypocortisolism \n \nThe suppression of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) secretion can result in hypocortisolism in \npatients treated with Signifor. It is therefore necessary to monitor and instruct patients on the signs and \nsymptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g. weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia). In the event of documented \nhypocortisolism, temporary exogenous steroid (glucocorticoid) replacement therapy and/or dose \n\n\n\n20 \n\nreduction or interruption of Signifor therapy may be necessary. Rapid decreases in cortisol levels may \nbe associated with decreases in white blood cell count. \n \nGallbladder and related events \n \nCholelithiasis (gallstones) is a recognised adverse reaction associated with somatostatin analogues and \nhas frequently been reported in clinical studies with pasireotide (see section 4.8). There have been \npost-marketing cases of cholangitis in patients taking Signifor, which in the majority of cases was \nreported as a complication ofgallstones. Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before and at 6 to \n12 month intervals during Signifor therapy is therefore recommended. The presence of gallstones in \nSignifor-treated patients is largely asymptomatic; symptomatic stones should be managed according to \nclinical practice. \n \nPituitary hormones \n \nAs the pharmacological activity of pasireotide mimics that of somatostatin, inhibition of pituitary \nhormones other than GH and/or IGF-1 in patients with acromegaly and ACTH/cortisol in patients with \nCushing’s disease cannot be ruled out. Monitoring of pituitary function (e.g. TSH/free T4) before and \nperiodically during Signifor therapy should therefore be considered, as clinically appropriate. \n \nEffect on female fertility \n \nThe therapeutic benefits of a reduction in growth hormone (GH) levels and normalisation of \ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration in female acromegalic patients and of a reduction or \nnormalisation of serum cortisol levels in female patients with Cushing’s disease could potentially \nrestore fertility. Female patients of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate \ncontraception if necessary during treatment with Signifor (see section 4.6). \n \nCoagulation abnormalities \n \nPatients with significantly increased prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \nvalues or patients receiving coumarin-derivative or heparin-derivative anticoagulants were excluded \nfrom clinical studies with pasireotide as the safety of the combination with such anticoagulants has not \nbeen established. If concomitant use of coumarin-derivative or heparin-derivative anticoagulants with \nSignifor intramuscular use cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored regularly for alterations in \ntheir coagulation parameters (PT and PTT) and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the increase in unbound drug exposure, Signifor should be used with caution in patients with \nsevere renal impairment or end stage renal disease (see section 5.2). \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAnticipated pharmacokinetic interactions resulting in effects on pasireotide \n \n\nThe influence of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous pasireotide \nwas tested in a drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers. No change in the pharmacokinetics \n(rate or extent of exposure) of pasireotide was observed. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAnticipated pharmacokinetic interactions resulting in effects on other medicinal products \n \nPasireotide may decrease the relative bioavailability of ciclosporin. Concomitant administration of \npasireotide and ciclosporin may require adjustment of the ciclosporin dose to maintain therapeutic \nlevels. \n \nAnticipated pharmacodynamic interactions \n \nMedicinal products that prolong the QT interval \n\nPasireotide should be used with caution in patients who are concomitantly receiving medicinal \nproducts that prolong the QT interval, such as class Ia antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, \ndisopyramide), class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide), \ncertain antibacterials (intravenous erythromycin, pentamidine injection, clarithromycin, moxifloxacin), \ncertain antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol, \ntiapride, amisulpride, sertindole, methadone), certain antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, \nmizolastine), antimalarials (e.g. chloroquine, halofantrine, lumefantrine), certain antifungals \n(ketoconazole, except in shampoo) (see also section 4.4). \n \nBradycardic medicinal products \n\nClinical monitoring of heart rate, notably at the beginning of treatment, is recommended in patients \nreceiving pasireotide concomitantly with bradycardic medicinal products, such as beta blockers (e.g. \nmetoprolol, carteolol, propranolol, sotalol), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. rivastigmine, \nphysostigmine), certain calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil), certain \nantiarrhythmics (see also section 4.4). \n \nInsulin and antidiabetic medicinal products \n\nDose adjustments (decrease or increase) of insulin and antidiabetic medicinal products (e.g. \nmetformin, liraglutide, vildagliptin, nateglinide) may be required when administered concomitantly \nwith pasireotide (see also section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of pasireotide in pregnant women. Studies in animals in \nwhich pasireotide was administered via the subcutaneous route have shown reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). Pasireotide is not recommended for use during pregnancy and in women of childbearing \npotential who are not using contraception (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pasireotide is excreted in human milk. Available data in rats in which \npasireotide was administered via the subcutaneous route have shown excretion of pasireotide in milk \n(see section 5.3). Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Signifor. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in rats in which pasireotide was administered via the subcutaneous route have shown effects \non female reproductive parameters (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these effects in humans \nis unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nSignifor may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nadvised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue, dizziness or \nheadache during treatment with Signifor. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of pasireotide intramuscular use is consistent with the somatostatin analogue class, \nexcept for the higher degree and frequency of hyperglycaemia seen with pasireotide intramuscular use. \nThe safety profile of pasireotide intramuscular use was largely similar between the acromegaly and \nCushing’s disease indications. \n \nAcromegaly \n\nIn acromegaly, the safety assessment was made based on 491 patients who received pasireotide \n(419 patients received pasireotide intramuscular use and 72 received pasireotide subcutaneous use) in \nphase I, II and III studies. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1/10) from the pooled \nsafety data from the phase III studies C2305 and C2402 were (in decreasing order): diarrhoea (most \ncommon in study C2305), cholelithiasis, hyperglycaemia (most common in study C2402) and diabetes \nmellitus. Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were mostly related to \nhyperglycaemia. \n \nCushing’s disease \n\nIn Cushing’s disease, the safety assessment of the intramuscular formulation was made based on \n150 patients who received pasireotide in the phase III study G2304 (median duration of exposure: \n57 weeks). Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive starting doses of either 10 mg or 30 mg \npasireotide, with a possibility to up-titrate to a maximum dose of 40 mg every 28 days. The most \ncommon adverse reactions (incidence ≥1/10) in the phase III study G2304 were hyperglycaemia, \ndiarrhoea, cholelithiasis and diabetes mellitus. The frequency and severity of adverse reactions tended \nto be higher with the higher starting dose of 30 mg, but this was not consistent for all adverse \nreactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 1 include events reported in the pivotal studies with the intramuscular \nformulation in patients with acromegaly and with Cushing’s disease. Adverse reactions are listed \naccording to MedDRA primary system organ class. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions \nare ranked by frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order \nof decreasing seriousness. Frequencies were defined as follows: Very common (≥1/10); common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions by preferred term for pasireotide intramuscular use \n\n \nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem disorders \n\n Anaemia   \n\nEndocrine \n\ndisorders \n Adrenal \n\ninsufficiency* \n  \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nHyperglycaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus \n\nType 2 diabetes \nmellitus, glucose \ntolerance \nimpaired, \ndecreased \nappetite \n\n Diabetic \nketoacidosis \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n Headache, \n\ndizziness \n  \n\nCardiac \n\ndisorders \n Sinus \n\nbradycardia*, QT \nprolongation \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \nDiarrhoea, \nnausea, \nabdominal pain* \n\nAbdominal \ndistension, \nvomiting \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders \nCholelithiasis Cholecystitis*, \n\ncholestasis \n  \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n Alopecia, pruritus   \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\nFatigue* Injection site \nreaction* \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Glycosylated \nhaemoglobin \nincreased, alanine \naminotransferase \nincreased, \naspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased, \ngamma-\nglutamyltransfera\nse increased, \nblood glucose \nincreased, blood \ncreatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased, lipase \nincreased \n\nAmylase \nincreased, \nprothrombin time \nprolonged \n\n \n\n* Grouped terms: Adrenal insufficiency includes adrenal insufficiency and blood cortisol \ndecreased.

Fatigue includes fatigue \nand asthenia. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGlucose metabolism disorders \n\nAcromegaly \n\nIn acromegaly patients elevated fasting glucose level was the most frequently reported \ngrade 3/4 laboratory abnormality in the two phase III studies. In study C2305, grade 3 elevated fasting \nglucose levels were reported in 9.7% and 0.6% and grade 4 in 0.6% and 0% of acromegaly patients \ntreated with pasireotide intramuscular use and octreotide intramuscular use, respectively. In study \nC2402, grade 3 elevated fasting glucose levels were reported in 14.3% and 17.7% of acromegaly \npatients treated with pasireotide intramuscular use 40 mg and 60 mg respectively, and in no patients in \nthe active control group. Two cases of hyperglycaemia-related emergencies (diabetic ketoacidosis and \ndiabetic hyperglycaemic coma) were reported following a dose increase of pasireotide to 60 mg in \nmedical treatment naïve patients; one in a patient with untreated hyperglycaemia and HbA1c >8% \nprior to initiation of pasireotide and the other in a patient with untreated hyperglycaemia and a fasting \nplasma glucose of 359 mg/dl, respectively. In both studies, mean FPG and HbA1c levels peaked within \nthe first three months of treatment with pasireotide intramuscular use. In medically naïve patients \n(study C2305), the mean absolute increase in FPG and HbA1c was similar at most of the time points \nfor all patients treated with pasireotide intramuscular use irrespective of baseline values. \n \nThe degree and frequency of hyperglycaemia observed in the two pivotal studies in acromegaly \npatients were higher with Signifor intramuscular use than with active control (octreotide intramuscular \nuse or lanreotide deep subcutaneous injection). In a pooled analysis of the two pivotal studies, the \noverall incidence of hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions was 58.6% (all grades) and 9.9% (CTC \nGrade 3 and 4) for Signifor intramuscular use versus 18.0% (all grades) and 1.1% (CTC Grade 3 and \n4) for the active control. In the pivotal study with patients inadequately controlled on another \nsomatostatin analogue, the proportion of patients not previously treated with anti-diabetic agents who \nrequired commencement of anti-diabetic therapy during the study was 17.5% and 16.1% in the \nSignifor 40 mg and 60 mg arms compared to 1.5% in the active control arm. In the pivotal study with \npatients who did not receive prior medical treatment, the proportion of patients who required \ncommencement of anti-diabetic therapy during the study was 36% in the Signifor arm compared to \n4.4% in the active control arm. \n \nCushing’s disease \n\nIn Cushing’s disease patients, elevated FPG levels was the most frequently reported CTC Grade 3 \nlaboratory abnormality (14.7% of patients) in the phase III study G2304; with no cases of Grade 4 \nreported. Mean HbA1c increases were less pronounced in patients with normal glycaemia at study \nentry in comparison to pre-diabetic patients or diabetic patients. Mean FPG levels commonly \nincreased within the first month of treatment with decreases and stabilisation observed in subsequent \nmonths. FPG and HbA1c increases were dose-dependent, and values generally decreased following \npasireotide intramuscular use discontinuation but remained above baseline values. The overall \nincidence of hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions was 75.3% (all grades) and 22.7% (CTC \nGrade 3). Adverse reactions of hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus led to study discontinuation in 3 \n(2.0%) and 4 patients (2.7%), respectively. \n \nThe elevations of fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c observed with pasireotide intramuscular use \ntreatment are reversible after discontinuation. \n \nMonitoring of blood glucose levels in patients treated with Signifor is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nGastrointestinal disorders were frequently reported with Signifor. These reactions were usually of low \ngrade, required no intervention and improved with continued treatment. In acromegaly patients, \ngastrointestinal disorders were less frequent in inadequately controlled patients compared to medically \nnaïve patients. \n \nInjection site reactions \n\nIn the phase III studies, injection site related reactions (e.g. injection site pain, injection site \n\n\n\n25 \n\ndiscomfort) were mostly grade 1 or 2 in severity. The incidence of such events was highest in the first \n3 months of treatment. In the acromegaly studies, the events were comparable between pasireotide \nintramuscular use and octreotide intramuscular use treated patients, and were less frequent in \ninadequately controlled patients compared to medically naïve patients. \n \nQT prolongation \n\nIn the acromegaly study C2305, the proportion of patients with newly occurring notable QT/QTc \nintervals was comparable between pasireotide intramuscular use and octreotide intramuscular use \ngroups up to crossover, with few notable outlying values. QTcF >480 ms was reported for 3 versus \n2 patients in the pasireotide intramuscular use and octreotide intramuscular use groups, respectively, \nand QTcF >60 ms prolonged from baseline was reported for 2 versus 1 patients in the respective \ngroups. In study C2402, the only notable outlier was a QTcF value >480 ms in 1 patient in the \npasireotide intramuscular use 40 mg group. In the Cushing’s disease study G2304, a QTcF value \n>480 ms was reported for 2 patients. No QTcF values >500 ms were observed in any of the pivotal \nstudies. \n \nLiver enzymes \n\nTransient elevations in liver enzymes have been reported with the use of somatostatin analogues and \nwere also observed in healthy subjects and patients receiving pasireotide in clinical studies. The \nelevations were mostly asymptomatic, of low grade and reversible with continued treatment. A few \ncases of concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN have \nbeen observed with the subcutaneous formulation, however not in patients treated with pasireotide \nintramuscular use. All observed cases of concurrent elevations were identified within ten days of \ninitiation of treatment. The patients recovered without clinical sequelae and liver function test results \nreturned to baseline values after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nMonitoring of liver enzymes is recommended before and during treatment with Signifor (see \nsection 4.4), as clinically appropriate. \n \nPancreatic enzymes \n\nAsymptomatic elevations in lipase and amylase were observed in patients receiving pasireotide in \nclinical studies. The elevations were mostly low grade and reversible while continuing treatment. \nPancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of somatostatin analogues due to the \nassociation between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment be initiated, as \ndictated by the patient’s clinical status, until resolution of the symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatostatin and \nanalogues, ATC code: H01CB05 \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n26 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nPasireotide is a cyclohexapeptide, injectable somatostatin analogue. Like the natural peptide hormones \nsomatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 (also known as somatotropin release inhibiting factor [SRIF]) \nand other somatostatin analogues, pasireotide exerts its pharmacological activity via binding to \nsomatostatin receptors. Five human somatostatin receptor subtypes are known: hsst1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. \nThese receptor subtypes are expressed in different tissues under normal physiological conditions. \nSomatostatin analogues bind to hsst receptors with different potencies (see Table 2). Pasireotide binds \nwith high affinity to four of the five hssts. \n \nTable 2 Binding affinities of somatostatin (SRIF-14), pasireotide, octreotide and lanreotide \n\nto the five human somatostatin receptor subtypes (hsst1-5) \n\n \nCompound hsst1 hsst2 hsst3 hsst4 hsst5 \n\nSomatostatin \n(SRIF-14) \n\n0.930.12 0.150.02 0.560.17 1.50.4 0.290.04 \n\nPasireotide 9.30.1 1.00.1 1.50.3 >1,000 0.160.01 \nOctreotide 28080 0.380.08 7.11.4 >1,000 6.31.0 \nLanreotide 18020 0.540.08 149 23040 175 \n\nResults are the meanSEM of IC50 values expressed as nmol/l. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatostatin receptors are expressed in many tissues, especially in neuroendocrine tumours in which \nhormones are excessively secreted, including GH in acromegaly and ACTH in Cushing’s disease. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that corticotroph tumour cells from Cushing’s disease patients display a \nhigh expression of hsst5, whereas the other receptor subtypes either are not expressed or are expressed \nat lower levels. Pasireotide binds and activates four of the five hssts, especially hsst5, in corticotrophs \nof ACTH producing adenomas, resulting in inhibition of ACTH secretion. \n \nDue to its broad binding profile to somatostatin receptors, pasireotide has the potential to stimulate \nboth hsst2 and hsst5 subtype receptors relevant for inhibition of GH and IGF-1 secretion and therefore \nto be effective for the treatment of acromegaly. \n \nGlucose metabolism \n\nIn a randomised double-blinded mechanism study conducted in healthy volunteers, the development of \nhyperglycaemia with pasireotide administered as pasireotide subcutaneous use at doses of 0.6 and \n0.9 mg twice a day was related to significant decreases in insulin secretion as well as incretin \nhormones (i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide \n[GIP]). Pasireotide did not affect insulin sensitivity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of pasireotide intramuscular use has been demonstrated in two phase III, multicentre \nstudies in acromegaly patients and in one phase III, multicentre study in Cushing’s disease patients. \n \nAcromegaly study C2402, inadequately controlled patients \nStudy C2402 was a phase III, multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, three-arm study of double-blind \npasireotide intramuscular use 40 mg and 60 mg versus open-label octreotide intramuscular use 30 mg \nor lanreotide deep subcutaneous injection 120 mg in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. \nA total of 198 patients were randomised to receive pasireotide intramuscular use 40 mg (n=65), \npasireotide intramuscular use 60 mg (n=65) or active control (n=68). 192 patients were treated. A total \nof 181 patients completed the core phase (24 weeks) of the study. \n \nInadequately controlled patients in study C2402 are defined as patients with a mean GH concentration \n\n\n\n27 \n\nof a 5-point profile over a 2-hour period >2.5 μg/l and sex- and age-adjusted IGF-1 >1.3 × ULN. \nPatients had to be treated with maximum indicated doses of octreotide intramuscular use (30 mg) or \nlanreotide deep subcutaneous injection (120 mg) for at least 6 months prior to randomisation. \nThree-quarters of patients had previously been treated with octreotide intramuscular use and a quarter \nwith lanreotide deep subcutaneous injection. Nearly half of the patients had additional prior medical \ntreatment for acromegaly other than somatostatin analogues. Two-thirds of all patients had undergone \nprior surgery. Baseline mean GH was 17.6 µg/l, 12.1 µg/l and 9.5 µg/l, in the 40 mg, 60 mg and active \ncontrol groups, respectively. IGF-1 mean values at baseline were 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 x ULN, respectively. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was to compare the proportion of patients achieving biochemical \ncontrol (defined as mean GH levels <2.5 μg/l and normalisation of sex- and age-adjusted IGF-1) at \nweek 24 with pasireotide intramuscular use 40 mg or 60 mg versus continued treatment with active \ncontrol (octreotide intramuscular use 30 mg or lanreotide deep subcutaneous injection 120 mg), \nseparately. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint for both pasireotide intramuscular use doses. \nThe proportion of patients achieving biochemical control was 15.4% (p-value = 0.0006) and 20.0% \n(p-value <0.0001) for pasireotide intramuscular use 40 mg and 60 mg, respectively at 24 weeks \ncompared with zero in the active control arm (Table 3). \n \nTable 3 Key results at week 24 (Study C2402) \n \n Signifor \n\nintramuscular use \n\n40 mg \n\nN=65 \n\nn (%), p value \n\nSignifor \n\nintramuscular use \n\n60 mg \n\nN=65 \n\nn (%), p value \n\nActive control \n\nN=68 \n\nn (%) \n\nGH<2.5 μg/l and normalised \nIGF-1* \n\n10 (15.4%), p=0.0006 13 (20.0%), \np<0.0001 \n\n0 (0%) \n\nNormalisation of IGF-1 16 (24.6%), p<0.0001 17 (26.2%), \np<0.0001 \n\n0 (0%) \n\nGH<2.5 μg/l 23 (35.4%) 28 (43.1%) 9 (13.2%) \n* Primary endpoint (patients with IGF-1< lower limit of normal (LLN) were not considered \n“responders”). \n \nIn patients treated with pasireotide intramuscular use in whom reductions in GH and IGF-1 levels \nwere observed, these changes occurred during the first 3 months of treatment and were maintained up \nto week 24. \n \nThe proportion of patients with a reduction or no change in pituitary tumour volume at week 24 was \n81.0% and 70.3% on pasireotide intramuscular use 40 and 60 mg, and 50.0% on active control. \nFurthermore, a higher proportion of patients on pasireotide intramuscular use (18.5% and 10.8% for \n40 mg and 60 mg, respectively) than active comparator (1.5%) achieved a reduction in tumour volume \nof at least 25%. \n \nHealth-related quality of life measured by AcroQol indicated statistically significant improvements \nfrom baseline to week 24 in the Physical, Psychological-Appearance and Global scores for the 60 mg \ngroup and the Physical sub-score for the 40mg group. Changes for the octreotide intramuscular use or \nlanreotide deep subcutaneous injection group were not statistically significant. The improvement \nobserved up to week 24 between the treatment groups was also not statistically significant. \n \nAcromegaly study C2305 patients who had no prior medical treatment \nA phase III multicentre, randomised, blinded study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of \npasireotide intramuscular use versus octreotide intramuscular use in medically naïve patients with \nactive acromegaly. A total of 358 patients were randomised and treated. Patients were randomised in a \n1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups in each of the following two strata: 1) patients who had \nundergone one or more pituitary surgeries but had not been treated medically or 2) de novo patients \npresenting a visible pituitary adenoma on MRI who had refused pituitary surgery or for whom \npituitary surgery was contraindicated. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nThe two treatment groups were well balanced in terms of baseline demographics and disease \ncharacteristics. 59.7% and 56% of patients in the pasireotide intramuscular use and octreotide \nintramuscular use treatment groups, respectively, were patients without previous pituitary surgery (de \nnovo). \n \nThe starting dose was 40 mg for pasireotide intramuscular use and 20 mg for octreotide intramuscular \nuse. Dose increase for efficacy was allowed at the discretion of the investigators after three and six \nmonths of treatment if biochemical parameters showed a mean GH ≥2.5 µg/l and/or IGF-1 >ULN (age \nand sex related). Maximum allowed dose was 60 mg for pasireotide intramuscular use and 30 mg for \noctreotide intramuscular use. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a reduction of mean GH level to \n<2.5 μg/l and the normalisation of IGF-1 to within normal limits (age and sex related) at month 12. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was met; the percentage of patients achieving biochemical control was \n31.3% and 19.2% for pasireotide intramuscular use and octreotide intramuscular use, respectively, \ndemonstrating a statistically significant superior result favouring pasireotide intramuscular use \n(p-value = 0.007) (Table 4). \n \nTable 4 Key results at month 12 - phase III study in acromegaly patients \n \n\n Pasireotide \nintramuscular use \n\nn (%) \n\nN=176 \n\nOctreotide \n\nintramuscular use \n\nn (%) \n\nN=182 \n\np-value \n\nGH <2.5 μg/l and normalised IGF-1* 31.3% 19.2% p=0.007 \nGH <2.5 μg/l and IGF-1 ≤ULN 35.8% 20.9% - \nNormalised IGF-1 38.6% 23.6% p=0.002 \nGH <2.5 μg/l 48.3% 51.6% p=0.536 \n\n* Primary endpoint (patients with IGF-1 <lower limit of normal (LLN) were not considered \n“responders”). \nULN = upper limit of normal \n \nBiochemical control was achieved early in the study (i.e. month 3) by a higher proportion of patients \nin the pasireotide intramuscular use arm than in the octreotide intramuscular use arm (30.1% and \n21.4%) and was maintained in all subsequent evaluations during the core phase. \n \nAt month 12, reduction in tumour volume was comparable between the treatment groups and in \npatients with and without previous pituitary surgery. The proportion of patients with a reduction of \ntumour volume greater than 20% at month 12 was 80.8% for pasireotide intramuscular use and 77.4% \nfor octreotide intramuscular use. \n \nHealth-related quality of life measured by AcroQol indicated statistically significant improvements in \nthe Physical, Psychological-Appearance and Global scores in both treatment groups at month 12. \nMean improvements from baseline were greater for pasireotide intramuscular use than for octreotide \nintramuscular use with no statistical significance. \n \nExtension phase \n\nAt the end of the core phase, patients achieving biochemical control or benefiting from the treatment \nas assessed by the investigator could continue to be treated in the extension phase with the study \ntreatment to which they were initially randomised. \n \nDuring the extension phase, 74 patients continued receiving pasireotide intramuscular use and \n46 patients continued with octreotide intramuscular use treatment. At month 25, 48.6% of patients \n(36/74) in the pasireotide intramuscular use group and 45.7% (21/46) in the octreotide intramuscular \nuse group achieved biochemical control. The percentage of patients who had mean GH values \n<2.5 µg/l and normalisation of IGF-1 at the same time point was also comparable between the two \n\n\n\n29 \n\ntreatment arms. \n \nDuring the extension phase, tumour volume continued to decrease. \n \nCrossover phase \n\nAt the end of the core phase, patients not adequately responding to their initial therapy were allowed to \nswitch treatment. 81 patients were crossed over from octreotide intramuscular use to pasireotide \nintramuscular use, and 38 patients were crossed over from pasireotide intramuscular use to octreotide \nintramuscular use. \n \nTwelve months after crossover, the percentage of patients achieving biochemical control was 17.3% \n(14/81) for pasireotide intramuscular use and 0% (0/38) for octreotide intramuscular use. The \npercentage of patients achieving biochemical control, including those patients with IGF-1 <LLN was \n25.9% in the pasireotide intramuscular use group and 0% in the octreotide intramuscular use group. \n \nFurther decrease in tumour volume was observed at month 12 after crossover for both treatment \ngroups, and was higher in patients who crossed over to pasireotide intramuscular use (-24.7%) than in \npatients who crossed over to octreotide intramuscular use (-17.9%). \n \nCushing’s disease study G2304 \nThe efficacy and safety of pasireotide intramuscular use was evaluated in a phase III, multicentre \nstudy over a 12-month treatment period in Cushing’s disease patients with persistent or recurrent \ndisease or de novo patients for whom surgery was not indicated or who refused surgery. The eligibility \ncriteria included a mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC) value of between 1.5 and 5 times upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) at screening. The study enrolled 150 patients. The mean age was 35.8 years, and the \nmajority of patients were female (78.8%). Most patients (82.0%) had undergone prior pituitary \nsurgery, and the mean baseline mUFC was 470 nmol/24h (ULN: 166.5 nmol/24h). \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to a starting dose of either 10 mg or 30 mg pasireotide \nintramuscular use every 4 weeks. After four months of treatment, patients with mUFC ≤1.5xULN \ncontinued on the blinded dose to which they were randomised, and patients with mUFC >1.5xULN \nhad their doses increased in a blinded manner from 10 mg to 30 mg, or from 30 mg to 40 mg, provided \nthere were no tolerability concerns. Additional dose adjustments (up to a maximum of 40 mg) were \nallowed at months 7 and 9 of the core phase. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of \npatients in each arm who achieved mean 24-hour UFC levels ≤ULN after 7 months of treatment, \nregardless of prior dose increase. Secondary end points included changes from baseline in: 24-hour \nUFC, plasma ACTH, serum cortisol levels, and clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease. All \nanalyses were conducted based on the randomised dose groups. \n \nResults \n\nThe study met the primary efficacy objective for both dose groups (lower bound of the 95% CI for the \nresponse rate of each treatment arm >15%). At month 7, a mUFC response was achieved in 41.9% and \n40.8% of patients randomised to starting doses of 10 mg and 30 mg, respectively. The proportion of \npatients who either attained mUFC ≤ULN or a mUFC reduction from baseline of at least 50% was \n50.0% in the 10 mg dose group and 56.6% in the 30 mg dose groups (Table 5). \n \nIn both dose groups, Signifor resulted in a decrease in mean UFC after 1 month of treatment, and this \nwas maintained over time. Decreases were also demonstrated by the overall percentage change from \nbaseline in mean and median mUFC levels at month 7 and 12. Reductions in serum cortisol and \nplasma ACTH levels were also observed at month 7 and 12 for each dose group. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTable 5 Key results - phase III study in Cushing’s disease patients (intramuscular \nformulation) \n\n \n Pasireotide 10 mg \n\nN=74 \n\nPasireotide 30 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPercentage of patients with:   \n mUFC ≤ULN at Month 7 (95% CI) * 41.9 (30.5, 53.9) 40.8 (29.7, 52.7) \n mUFC ≤ULN and no prior dose increase \n\nat Month 7 (95% CI) \n28.4 (18.5, 40.1) 31.6 (21.4, 43.3) \n\n mUFC ≤ULN or ≥50% decrease from \nbaseline at month 7 (95% CI) \n\n50.0 (38.1, 61.9) 56.6 (44.7, 67.9) \n\nMedian (min, max) % mUFC change from \nbaseline at month 7 \n\n-47.9 (-94.2, 651.1) -48.5 (-99.7, 181.7) \n\nMedian (min, max) % mUFC change from \nbaseline at month 12 \n\n-52.5 (-96.9, 332.8) -51.9 (-98.7, 422.3) \n\n* Primary endpoint using LOCF (last observation carried forward) \nmUFC: mean urinary free cortisol; ULN: upper limit of normal; CI: confidence interval \n \nDecreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in body weight were observed in both dose \ngroups at month 7. Overall reductions in these parameters tended to be greater in patients that were \nmUFC responders. Similar trends were observed at month 12. \n \nAt month 7, most patients demonstrated either improvement in or stable signs of Cushing’s disease \nsuch as hirsuitism, striae, bruising and muscle strength. Facial rubor improved in 43.5% (47/108) of \npatients, and more than a third of patients demonstrated improvement in supraclavicular fat pad \n(34.3%) and dorsal fat pad (34.6%). Similar results were also seen at month 12. \n \nHealth-related quality of life was assessed by a disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure \n(CushingQoL) and a generic quality of life measure (SF-12v2 General Health Survey). Improvements \nwere observed in both dose groups for CushingQoL and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of \nSF-12v2, but not for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of SF-12v2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSignifor in all subsets of the paediatric population in acromegaly and pituitary gigantism, and in \npituitary dependant Cushing’s disease, overproduction of pituitary ACTH and pituitary dependant \nhyperadrenocorticism (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPasireotide for intramuscular use is formulated as microspheres for long-acting release. After a single \ninjection, the plasma pasireotide concentration shows an initial burst release on the injection day, \nfollowed by a dip from day 2 to day 7, then a slow increase to maximum concentration around day 21, \nand a slow declining phase over the next weeks, concomitant with the terminal degradation phase of \nthe polymer matrix of the dosage form. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe relative bioavailability of pasireotide intramuscular use over pasireotide subcutaneous use is \ncomplete. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the absolute bioavailability of pasireotide in \nhumans. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn healthy volunteers, pasireotide intramuscular use is widely distributed with large apparent volume \nof distribution (Vz/F >100 litres). Distribution between blood cells and plasma is concentration \n\n\n\n31 \n\nindependent and shows that pasireotide is primarily located in the plasma (91%). Plasma protein \nbinding is moderate (88%) and independent of concentration. \n \nBased on in vitro data pasireotide appears to be a substrate of efflux transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein). \nBased on in vitro data pasireotide is not a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer \nresistance protein) nor of the influx transporters OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), OATP (organic \nanion-transporting polypeptide) 1B1, 1B3 or 2B1. At therapeutic dose levels pasireotide is also not an \ninhibitor of UGT1A1, OATP1B1 or 1B3, OAT1 or OAT3, OCT1 or OCT2, P-gp, BCRP, MRP2 and \nBSEP. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPasireotide is metabolically highly stable and in vitro data show that pasireotide is not a substrate, \ninhibitor or inducer of CYP450. In healthy volunteers, pasireotide is predominantly found in \nunchanged form in plasma, urine and faeces. \n \nElimination \n \nPasireotide is eliminated mainly via hepatic clearance (biliary excretion), with a small contribution of \nthe renal route. In a human ADME study 55.9±6.63% of the radioactive pasireotide subcutaneous dose \nwas recovered over the first 10 days after administration, including 48.3±8.16% of the radioactivity in \nfaeces and 7.63±2.03% in urine. \n \nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) of pasireotide intramuscular use in healthy volunteers is on average \n4.5-8.5 litres/h. Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, the estimated CL/F was \napproximately 4.8 to 6.5 litres/h for typical Cushing’s disease patients, and approximately 5.6 to \n8.2 litres/h for typical acromegaly patients. \n \nLinearity and time dependency \n \nPharmacokinetic steady state for pasireotide intramuscular use is achieved after three months. \nFollowing multiple monthly doses, pasireotide intramuscular use demonstrates approximately \ndose-proportional pharmacokinetic exposures in the dose range of 10 mg to 60 mg every 4 weeks. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n\nNo studies have been performed in paediatric patients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\nRenal clearance has a minor contribution to the elimination of pasireotide in humans. In a clinical \nstudy with single subcutaneous dose administration of 900 µg pasireotide in subjects with impaired \nrenal function, renal impairment of mild, moderate or severe degree, or end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) did not have a significant impact on total pasireotide plasma exposure. The unbound plasma \npasireotide exposure (AUCinf,u) was increased in subjects with renal impairment (mild: 33%; moderate: \n25%, severe: 99%, ESRD: 143%) compared to control subjects. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo clinical studies in subjects with liver impairment have been performed with pasireotide \nintramuscular use. In a clinical study of a single subcutaneous dose of pasireotide in subjects with \nimpaired hepatic function, statistically significant differences were found in subjects with moderate \nand severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C). In subjects with moderate and severe hepatic \nimpairment, AUCinf was increased 60% and 79%, Cmax was increased 67% and 69%, and CL/F was \ndecreased 37% and 44%, respectively. \n \nElderly patients (≥65 years) \n\nAge is not a significant covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nDemographics \n\nPopulation PK analyses of pasireotide intramuscular use suggest that race does not influence PK \nparameters. PK exposures had a slight correlation with body weight in the study with medical \ntreatment naïve patients, but not in the study with inadequately controlled patients. Female acromegaly \npatients had a higher exposure of 32% and 51% compared to male patients in studies with medical \ntreatment naïve patients and inadequately controlled patients, respectively; these differences in \nexposure were not clinically relevant based on efficacy and safety data. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety data from studies performed with pasireotide administered via the subcutaneous \nroute reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Additionally, tolerability and repeated \ndose toxicity studies were conducted with pasireotide via the intramuscular route. Most findings seen \nin repeated toxicity studies were reversible and attributable to the pharmacology of pasireotide. Effects \nin non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nPasireotide administered via the subcutaneous route did not affect fertility in male rats but, as expected \nfrom the pharmacology of pasireotide, females presented abnormal cycles or acyclicity, and decreased \nnumbers of corpora lutea and implantation sites. Embryo toxicity was seen in rats and rabbits at doses \nthat caused maternal toxicity but no teratogenic potential was detected. In the pre- and postnatal study \nin rats, pasireotide had no effects on labour and delivery, but caused slight retardation in the \ndevelopment of pinna detachment and reduced body weight of the offspring. \n \nAvailable toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of pasireotide in milk. \n \n \n6.

Do not freeze. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \nPowder: brownish vial (glass) with rubber stopper (chlorobutyl rubber), containing the active \nsubstance (pasireotide). \nSolvent: colourless pre-filled syringe (glass) with front and plunger stopper (chlorobutyl rubber), \ncontaining 2 ml solvent. \n \nUnit packs (all strengths): each unit pack contains a blister tray with one injection kit (one vial and, in \na separate sealed section, one pre-filled syringe, one vial adapter and one safety-engineered needle for \ninjection). \n \nMultipacks (40 mg and 60 mg strengths only): each multipack contains 3 intermediate cartons, each \ncontaining a blister tray with one injection kit (one vial and, in a separate sealed section, one pre-filled \nsyringe, one vial adapter and one safety engineered needle for injection). \n \nNot all pack sizes or strengths may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThere are two critical steps in the reconstitution of Signifor. Not following them could result in \nfailure to deliver the injection appropriately. \n\n The injection kit must reach room temperature. Remove the injection kit from the fridge and \nlet the kit stand at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes before reconstitution, but do \nnot exceed 24 hours. \n\n After adding the solvent, shake the vial moderately for a minimum of 30 seconds until a \nuniform suspension is formed. \n\n \nIncluded in the injection kit: \na One vial containing the powder \nb One pre-filled syringe containing the solvent \nc One vial adapter for medicinal product reconstitution \nd One safety injection needle (20G x 1.5″) \n \nFollow the instructions below carefully to ensure proper reconstitution of Signifor powder and solvent \nfor suspension for injection before deep intramuscular injection. \n \nSignifor suspension must only be prepared immediately before administration. \n \nSignifor should only be administered by a trained healthcare professional. \n \nTo prepare Signifor for deep intramuscular injection, please adhere to the following instructions: \n \n\n1. Remove the Signifor injection kit from refrigerated storage. ATTENTION: It is \nessential to start the reconstitution process only after the injection kit reaches room \n\ntemperature. Let the kit stand at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes \n\n\n\n34 \n\nbefore reconstitution, but do not exceed 24 hours. If not used within 24 hours, the \ninjection kit can be returned to the fridge. \n\n2. Remove the plastic cap from the vial and clean the rubber stopper of the vial with an \nalcohol wipe. \n\n3. Remove the lid film of the vial adapter packaging, but do NOT remove the vial adapter \nfrom its packaging. \n\n4. Holding the vial adapter packaging, position the vial adapter on top of the vial and push it \nfully down so that it snaps in place, confirmed by a “click”. \n\n5. Remove the packaging from the vial adapter by lifting it straight up. \n6. Remove the cap from the syringe pre-filled with solvent and screw the syringe onto the \n\nvial adapter. \n7. Slowly push the plunger all the way down to transfer all the solvent in the vial. \n8. ATTENTION: Keep the plunger pressed and shake the vial moderately for a minimum \n\nof 30 seconds so that the powder is completely suspended. Repeat moderate shaking \nfor another 30 seconds if the powder is not completely suspended. \n\n9. Turn syringe and vial upside down, slowly pull the plunger back and draw the entire \ncontent from the vial into the syringe. \n\n10. Unscrew the syringe from the vial adapter. \n11. Screw the safety injection needle onto the syringe. \n12. Pull the protective cover straight off the needle. To avoid sedimentation, you may gently \n\nshake the syringe to maintain a uniform suspension. Gently tap the syringe to remove any \nvisible bubbles and expel them from the syringe. The reconstituted Signifor is now ready \nfor immediate administration. \n\n13. Signifor must be given only by deep intramuscular injection. Prepare the injection site \nwith an alcohol wipe. Insert the needle fully into the left or right gluteus at a 90° angle to \nthe skin. Slowly pull back the plunger to check that no blood vessel has been penetrated \n(reposition if a blood vessel has been penetrated). Slowly depress the plunger until the \nsyringe is empty. Withdraw the needle from the injection site and activate the safety \nguard. \n\n14. Activate the safety guard over the needle, in one of the two methods shown: \n- either press the hinged section of the safety guard down onto a hard surface \n- or push the hinge forward with your finger \nAn audible “click” confirms proper activation. Dispose of syringe immediately in a \nsharps container. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Signifor is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Signifor \n3. How to use Signifor \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Signifor \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Signifor is and what it is used for \n\n \nSignifor is a medicine that contains the active substance pasireotide. It is used to treat Cushing’s \ndisease in adult patients for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed. \n \nCushing’s disease is caused by an enlargement in the pituitary gland (a gland at the base of the brain) \ncalled a pituitary adenoma. This leads the body to over-produce a hormone called adrenocorticotropic \nhormone (ACTH), which in turn results in over-production of another hormone called cortisol. \n \nThe human body naturally produces a substance called somatostatin, which blocks the production of \ncertain hormones, including ACTH. Pasireotide works in a very similar way to somatostatin. Signifor \nis thus able to block the production of ACTH, helping to control the over-production of cortisol and \nimprove the symptoms of Cushing’s disease. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Signifor works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \nask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Signifor \n\n \nDo not use Signifor \n\n- if you are allergic to pasireotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Signifor if you currently have or have ever had: \n- problems with your blood sugar levels, whether too high (as in hyperglycaemia/diabetes) or too \n\nlow (hypoglycaemia); \n- heart problems such as a recent heart attack, congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease \n\nwhere the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body) or sudden and oppressive chest \npain (usually felt as pressure, heaviness, tightening, squeezing or aching across the chest); \n\n\n\n91 \n\n- a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or an abnormal electrical signal called \n“prolongation of the QT interval”, or “QT prolongation”; \n\n- low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood; \n- gallstones. \n \nDuring your treatment with Signifor \n\n- Signifor controls over-production of cortisol. The control may be too strong and you may \nexperience signs or symptoms associated with a lack of cortisol, such as extreme weakness, \ntiredness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting or low blood pressure. If this happens, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- Signifor may cause your blood sugar to increase. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood \nsugar and start treatment with or adjust your antidiabetic medicine. \n\n- Signifor may lower your heart rate. Your doctor may wish to monitor your heart rate using a \nmachine that measures electrical activity of the heart (an “ECG”, or electrocardiogram). If you \nare using medicine to treat a heart condition, your doctor may also need to adjust its dosage. \n\n- your doctor may also wish to check your gallbladder, liver enzymes and pituitary hormones \nperiodically, since these might all be affected by this medicine. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old because no data are available \nin this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Signifor \n\nSignifor may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are using other medicines at the same \ntime as Signifor (including medicines obtained without a prescription), your doctor may need to \nmonitor your heart more carefully or change the dose of Signifor or the other medicines. Tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Especially, \ntell your doctor if you are using: \n- medicines to treat irregular heartbeat, such as medicines containing disopyramide, \n\nprocainamide, quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, amiodarone or dronedarone; \n- medicines to treat bacterial infections (by mouth: clarithromycin, moxifloxacin; via injection: \n\nerythromycin, pentamidine); \n- medicines to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole, except in shampoo); \n- medicines to treat certain psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, \n\npimozide, haloperidol, tiapride, amisulpride, sertindole, methadone); \n- medicines to treat hay fever and other allergies (terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine); \n- medicines used in the prevention or treatment of malaria (chloroquine, halofantrine, \n\nlumefantrine); \n- medicines to control blood pressure such as: \n\n beta blockers (metoprolol, carteolol, propranolol, sotalol) \n calcium channel blockers (bepridil, verapamil, diltiazem) \n cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, physostigmine); \n\n- medicines to control the balance of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) in your body. \n \nIt is particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines: \n- ciclosporin (used in organ transplantation to reduce the activity of the immune system); \n- medicines to treat blood sugar levels that are too high (as in diabetes) or too low \n\n(hypoglycaemia), such as: \n insulin; \n metformin, liraglutide, vildagliptin, nateglinide (antidiabetic medicines). \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using any medicine. \n- You should not use Signifor during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or \n\nthink that you may be, it is important to tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you \ncan use Signifor during your pregnancy. \n\n- You should not breast-feed while using Signifor. It is not known whether Signifor passes into \n\n\n\n92 \n\nbreast milk. \n- If you are a sexually active woman, you should use an effective method of contraception during \n\ntreatment. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n\nSignifor may have a minor effect on the ability to drive and use machines, because some of the side \neffects you may experience while using Signifor, such as dizziness, headache and tiredness, may \nreduce your ability to drive and use machines safely. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Signifor \n\nSignifor contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, which means it is essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3.

Signifor should be administered using \nsterile disposable syringes and injection needles. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will have instructed you on how to use Signifor ampoules. However, before \nusing the ampoule, please read the following information carefully. If you are not sure about giving \nyourself the injection or if you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. \n \nThe injection can be prepared using either two different needles to draw up and inject the solution or \none short fine injection needle for both steps. Based on the local clinical practice, your doctor or nurse \nwill tell you which method to use. Please follow their instructions. \n \nStore Signifor ampoules according to the storage conditions listed on the box. \n \nImportant safety information \n\nCaution: Keep the ampoules out of the reach of children. \n\n \nWhat do I need \n\nTo give yourself an injection you will need: \n1. One Signifor ampoule \n2. Alcohol wipes or similar \n3. One sterile syringe \n4. One long thick blunt sterile needle for drawing up the solution (your doctor or nurse will tell \n\nyou if this is needed) \n5. One short fine sterile needle \n6. A sharps container or other rigid closed disposal container \n \nThe injection site \n\nThe injection site is the place on your body where you are going to give yourself the injection. \nSignifor is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short needle into the \nfatty tissue just under the skin. The thighs and the abdomen are good areas for subcutaneous injection. \nAvoid soreness and skin irritation by choosing a different site from the previous one for each injection. \nYou should also avoid injections at sites that are sore or where the skin is irritated. \n \nGetting started \n\nWhen you are ready to give yourself the injection, carefully follow the steps below: \n- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n- Use new disposable needles and syringes every time you give yourself an injection. Use \n\nsyringes and needles only once. Never share needles and syringes. \n- Take the ampoule out of the box. \n- Inspect the ampoule. DO NOT USE if it is broken or if the liquid looks cloudy or contains \n\nparticles. In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. \n \nTo reduce local discomfort, it is recommended that the solution is at room temperature before \nadministration. \n \nAmpoules should be opened just prior to administration, and any unused portion discarded. \n \nCheck the expiry date and the dose \n\nCheck the expiry date which is stated on the ampoule label (after “EXP”) and check that the ampoule \ncontains the dose that your doctor has prescribed. \n \nDO NOT USE if the medicine has expired or if the dose is incorrect. In both these cases, return \n\nthe entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\nHow to inject Signifor \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 1: \nSignifor solution for injection is filled in a break-off \nampoule. The coloured dot on the top part marks the \nposition of the breaking point on the neck of the \nampoule. Tap the ampoule with your finger in order to \nmake sure there is no liquid in the top part when you \nopen the ampoule. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 2: \n\nRecommended procedure: hold the ampoule in an \nupright position with the coloured dot facing away \nfrom you. Hold the base of the ampoule in one hand. \nKeeping your thumbs together above and below the \nneck, break off the top of the ampoule at the breaking \npoint. Once the ampoule is open, put it upright on a \nclean, flat surface. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 3: \nTake the sterile syringe and attach the needle to it. If \nyou have been told to use two needles, you should use \nthe long thick blunt one for this step. \n \nBefore you proceed to step 4, clean the injection site \nwith an alcohol wipe. \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n \nStep 4: \nRemove the cover from the needle. Put the needle into \nthe ampoule and pull the plunger to draw up the entire \ncontents of the ampoule into the syringe. \nIf you have been told to use two needles, you should \nnow replace the long needle with the short one. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 5: \nHold the syringe in one hand between two fingers with \nyour thumb at the bottom of the plunger. Tap the \nsyringe with your fingers to get rid of air bubbles. \nMake sure there is no air bubble in the syringe by \npressing the plunger until the first drop appears on the \ntip of the needle. \nDo not let the needle touch anything. You are now \nready to inject. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 6: \nGently pinch the skin at the injection site and, holding \nthe needle at an angle of approximately 45 degrees (as \nshown in the picture) insert it into the injection site. \nPull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood \nvessel has not been punctured. If you see blood in the \nsyringe, first remove the needle from the skin, then \nreplace the short needle with a new one and insert it \ninto a different injection site. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 7: \nAlways keeping your skin pinched, slowly press the \nplunger down as far as it will go until all the solution \nis injected. Keep the plunger pressed down and hold \nthe syringe in place for 5 seconds. \n\n \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\n \nStep 8: \nSlowly release the skin fold and gently pull the needle \nout. Put the cover back on the needle. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 9: \nDispose of the used syringe and needle immediately in \na sharps container or other rigid closed disposal \ncontainer. Any unused product or waste material \nshould be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nSignifor 10 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection \n\nSignifor 20 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection \n\nSignifor 30 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection \n\nSignifor 40 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection \n\nSignifor 60 mg powder and solvent for suspension for injection \n\npasireotide \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use Signifor \n3. How to use Signifor \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Signifor \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Signifor is and what it is used for \n\n \nSignifor is a medicine that contains the active substance pasireotide. It is used to treat acromegaly in \nadult patients. It is also used to treat Cushing’s disease in adult patients for whom surgery is not an \noption or for whom surgery has failed. \n \nAcromegaly \nAcromegaly is caused by a type of tumour called a pituitary adenoma which develops in the pituitary \ngland at the base of the brain. The adenoma leads the body to over-produce hormones that control \ngrowth of tissues, organs and bones, resulting in an increase in the size of bones and tissues, especially \nin the hands and feet. \n \nSignifor reduces the production of these hormones and possibly also the size of the adenoma. As a \nresult, it reduces the symptoms of acromegaly, which include headache, increased sweating, numbness \nof the hands and feet, tiredness and joint pain. \n \nCushing’s disease \nCushing’s disease is caused by an enlargement in the pituitary gland (a gland at the base of the brain) \ncalled a pituitary adenoma. This leads the body to over-produce a hormone called adrenocorticotropic \nhormone (ACTH), which in turn results in over-production of another hormone called cortisol. \n \nThe human body naturally produces a substance called somatostatin, which blocks the production of \ncertain hormones, including ACTH. Pasireotide works in a very similar way to somatostatin. Signifor \nis thus able to block the production of ACTH, helping to control the over production of cortisol and \nimprove the symptoms of Cushing’s disease. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Signifor works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \nask your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Signifor \n\n \nDo not use Signifor \n\n- if you are allergic to pasireotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Signifor if you currently have or have ever had: \n- problems with your blood sugar levels, whether too high (as in hyperglycaemia/diabetes) or too \n\nlow (hypoglycaemia); \n- heart problems such as a recent heart attack, congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease \n\nwhere the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body) or sudden and oppressive chest \npain (usually felt as pressure, heaviness, tightening, squeezing or aching across the chest); \n\n- a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or an abnormal electrical signal called \n“prolongation of the QT interval”, or “QT prolongation”; \n\n- low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood; \n- gallstones; \n- or if you are taking anticoagulants (medicines used to reduce the clotting ability of the blood), \n\nyour doctor will monitor your coagulation parameters and may adjust your anticoagulant dose. \n \nDuring your treatment with Signifor: \n- Signifor may cause your blood sugar to increase. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood \n\nsugar and start treatment with or adjust your antidiabetic medicine. \n- Signifor controls over-production of cortisol. The control may be too strong and you may \n\nexperience signs or symptoms associated with a lack of cortisol, such as extreme weakness, \ntiredness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting or low blood pressure. If this happens, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- Signifor may lower your heart rate. Your doctor may wish to monitor your heart rate using a \nmachine that measures electrical activity of the heart (an “ECG”, or electrocardiogram). If you \nare using medicine to treat a heart condition, your doctor may also need to adjust its dosage. \n\n- your doctor may also wish to check your gallbladder, liver enzymes and pituitary hormones \nperiodically, since these might all be affected by this medicine. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old because no data are available \nin this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Signifor \n\nSignifor may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are using other medicines at the same \ntime as Signifor (including medicines obtained without a prescription), your doctor may need to \nmonitor your heart more carefully or change the dose of Signifor or the other medicines. Tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Especially, \ntell your doctor if you are using: \n- medicines used in organ transplantation to reduce the activity of the immune system \n\n(ciclosporin); \n- medicines to treat blood sugar levels that are too high (as in diabetes) or too low \n\n(hypoglycaemia) such as: \n insulin \n metformin, liraglutide, vildagliptin, nateglinide (antidiabetic medicines); \n\n- medicines to treat irregular heartbeat, such as medicines containing disopyramide, \nprocainamide, quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, amiodarone or dronedarone; \n\n- medicines to treat bacterial infections (by mouth: clarithromycin, moxifloxacin; via injection: \nerythromycin, pentamidine); \n\n- medicines to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole, except in shampoo); \n- medicines to treat certain psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, \n\npimozide, haloperidol, tiapride, amisulpride, sertindole, methadone); \n\n\n\n103 \n\n- medicines to treat hay fever and other allergies (terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine); \n- medicines used in the prevention or treatment of malaria (chloroquine, halofantrine, \n\nlumefantrine); \n- medicines to control blood pressure such as: \n\n beta blockers (metoprolol, carteolol, propranolol, sotalol) \n calcium channel blockers (bepridil, verapamil, diltiazem) \n cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, physostigmine); \n\n- medicines to control the balance of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) in your body. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using any medicine. \n- You should not use Signifor during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant, \n\nthink you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before \ntaking this medicine. \n\n- If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine, as it is not \nknown whether Signifor passes into breast milk. \n\n- If you are a sexually active woman, you should use an effective method of contraception during \ntreatment. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before taking this medicine. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n\nSignifor may have a minor effect on the ability to drive and use machines, because some of the side \neffects you may experience while using Signifor, such as headache, dizziness and tiredness, may \nreduce your ability to drive and use machines safely. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Signifor \n\nSignifor contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, which means it is essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use Signifor \n\n \n\nThis medicine will be given to you by a trained healthcare professional. \n \nHow much Signifor to use \n\n \nAcromegaly \nThe recommended starting dose of Signifor in acromegaly is 40 mg every 4 weeks. After you have \nstarted treatment, your doctor may reassess your dose. This may involve measuring the levels of \ngrowth hormone or other hormones in your blood. Depending on the results and how you are feeling, \nthe dose of Signifor given in each injection may need to be reduced or increased. The dose should not \nexceed 60 mg. If you have liver disease before you start Signifor treatment for acromegaly, your \ndoctor may want to start your treatment with a dose of 20 mg. \n \nCushing’s disease \nThe usual starting dose of Signifor in Cushing’s disease is 10 mg every 4 weeks. After you have \nstarted treatment, your doctor may reassess your dose. This may involve measuring the levels of \ncortisol in your blood or urine. Depending on the results and how you are feeling, the dose of Signifor \ngiven in each injection may need to be reduced or increased.

Not following them could result in \nfailure to deliver the injection appropriately. \n\n \n\n The injection kit must reach room temperature. Remove the injection kit from the fridge \nand let the kit stand at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes before reconstitution, \nbut do not exceed 24 hours. \n\n After adding the solvent, shake the vial moderately for a minimum of 30 seconds until a \nuniform suspension is formed. \n\n \n \nIncluded in the injection kit: \n \n\n \n \na One vial containing the powder \nb One pre-filled syringe containing the solvent \nc One vial adapter for medicinal product reconstitution \nd One safety injection needle (20G x 1.5″) \n \nFollow the instructions below carefully to ensure proper reconstitution of Signifor powder and solvent \nfor suspension for injection before deep intramuscular injection. \n \nSignifor suspension must only be prepared immediately before administration. \n \nSignifor should only be administered by a trained healthcare professional. \n\n\n\n110 \n\nStep 1 \n\nRemove the Signifor injection kit from \nrefrigerated storage. \nATTENTION: It is essential to start the \n\nreconstitution process only after the injection \n\nkit reaches room temperature. Let the kit \n\nstand at room temperature for a minimum of \n\n30 minutes before reconstitution, but do not \n\nexceed 24 hours. \n\nNote: If not used within 24 hours, the injection kit \ncan be returned to the fridge. \n\n \n \n\nStep 2 \n\nRemove the plastic cap from the vial and clean \nthe rubber stopper of the vial with an alcohol \nwipe. \n\n \n\nRemove the lid film of the vial adapter \npackaging, but do NOT remove the vial adapter \nfrom its packaging. \n \nHolding the vial adapter packaging, position the \nvial adapter on top of the vial and push it fully \ndown so that it snaps in place, confirmed by a \n“click”. \n\n \nRemove the packaging from the vial adapter by \nlifting it straight up as shown. \n\n \n\n30 \nmin \n\n\n\n111 \n\nStep 3 \n\nRemove the cap from the syringe pre-filled with \nsolvent and screw the syringe onto the vial \nadapter. \n\n \n\nSlowly push the plunger all the way down to \ntransfer all the solvent in the vial. \n\n \nStep 4 \n\nATTENTION: Keep the plunger pressed and \nshake the vial moderately for a minimum of \n30 seconds so that the powder is completely \nsuspended. Repeat moderate shaking for \nanother 30 seconds if the powder is not \n\ncompletely suspended. \n\n \n\nStep 5 \n\nTurn syringe and vial upside down, slowly pull \nthe plunger back and draw the entire content from \nthe vial into the syringe. \n\n \n\nUnscrew the syringe from the vial adapter. \n\n \n\n\n\n112 \n\nStep 6 \n\nScrew the safety injection needle onto the \nsyringe. \n\n \n\nPull the protective cover straight off the needle. \nTo avoid sedimentation, you may gently shake \nthe syringe to maintain a uniform suspension. \nGently tap the syringe to remove any visible \nbubbles and expel them from the syringe. The \nreconstituted Signifor is now ready for \nimmediate administration. \n\n \nStep 7 \n\nSignifor must be given only by deep \nintramuscular injection. \nPrepare the injection site with an alcohol wipe. \nInsert the needle fully into the left or right gluteus \nat a 90° angle to the skin. \nSlowly pull back the plunger to check that no \nblood vessel has been penetrated (reposition if a \nblood vessel has been penetrated). \nSlowly depress the plunger until the syringe is \nempty. Withdraw the needle from the injection \nsite and activate the safety guard (as shown in \nStep 8). \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 8 \n\nActivate the safety guard over the needle, in one \nof the two methods shown: \n- either press the hinged section of the safety \n\nguard down onto a hard surface (figure A), \n- or push the hinge forward with your finger \n\n(figure B). \nAn audible “click” confirms proper activation. \n \nDispose of syringe immediately in a sharps \ncontainer. \n\n \n\n \n\nInjection sites \n\nangle \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
