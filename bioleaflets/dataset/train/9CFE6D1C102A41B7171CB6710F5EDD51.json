NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRelvar Ellipta 92 micrograms/22 micrograms inhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single inhalation provides a delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece) of 92 micrograms of \nfluticasone furoate and 22 micrograms of vilanterol (as trifenatate). This corresponds to a pre-dispensed dose \nof 100 micrograms of fluticasone furoate and 25 micrograms vilanterol (as trifenatate). \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n \nEach delivered dose contains approximately 25 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n(Inhalation powder). \n \nWhite powder in a light grey inhaler with a yellow mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAsthma \nRelvar Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and \nolder where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is \nappropriate: \n\n\uf0b7 patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting \nbeta2-agonists. \n\n\uf0b7 patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist. \n \n\nCOPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) \n \nRelvar Ellipta is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adults with COPD with a FEV1<70% predicted \nnormal (post-bronchodilator) with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator therapy.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAsthma \n \nPatients with asthma should be given the strength of Relvar Ellipta containing the appropriate fluticasone \nfuroate (FF) dosage for the severity of their disease. Prescribers should be aware that in patients with asthma, \nfluticasone furoate (FF) 100 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent to fluticasone propionate \n(FP) 250 micrograms twice daily, while FF 200 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent to FP \n500 micrograms twice daily. \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and over   \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n \nA starting dose of one inhalation of Relvar Ellipta 92/22 micrograms once daily should be considered for \nadults and adolescents 12 years and over who require a low to mid dose of inhaled corticosteroid in \ncombination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. If patients are inadequately controlled on Relvar Ellipta \n92/22 micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional \nimprovement in asthma control. \n \nPatients should be regularly reassessed by a healthcare professional so that the strength of fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose \nshould be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. \n \nRelvar Ellipta 184/22 micrograms should be considered for adults and adolescents 12 years and over who \nrequire a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. \n \nPatients usually experience an improvement in lung function within 15 minutes of inhaling Relvar Ellipta.  \nHowever, the patient should be informed that regular daily usage is necessary to maintain control of asthma \nsymptoms and that use should be continued even when asymptomatic. \n \nIf symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be used for \nimmediate relief. \n \n \nChildren aged under 12 years \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Relvar Ellipta in children under 12 years of age has not yet been established in the \nindication for asthma. \nNo data are available.COPD \n \nAdults aged 18 years and over \n \nOne inhalation of Relvar Ellipta 92/22 micrograms once daily.  \n \nRelvar Ellipta 184/22 micrograms is not indicated for patients with COPD. There is no additional benefit of \nthe 184/22 micrograms dose compared to the 92/22 micrograms dose and there is a potential increased risk \nof pneumonia and systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nPatients usually experience an improvement in lung function within 16-17 minutes of inhaling Relvar Ellipta. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Relvar Ellipta in the paediatric population for the indication of COPD. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly patients (>65 years) \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nStudies in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment showed an increase in systemic \nexposure to fluticasone furoate (both Cmax and AUC) (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCaution should be exercised when dosing patients with hepatic impairment who may be more at risk of \nsystemic adverse reactions associated with corticosteroids.  \nFor patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment the maximum dose is 92/22 micrograms (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nRelvar Ellipta is for inhalation use only. \n \nIt should be administered at the same time of the day, each day.  \n \nThe final decision on evening or morning dosing should be left to the discretion of the physician. \n \nIf a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. \n \nIf stored in a refrigerator, the inhaler should be allowed to return to room temperature for at least an hour \nbefore use. \n \nWhen the inhaler is used for the first time, there is no need to check that it is working properly, and to \nprepare it for use in any special way. The step-by-step instructions should be followed. \n \nThe Ellipta inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant \nsachet should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled.  \n \nThe patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose.  \n \nWhen the inhaler is taken out of its tray, it will be in the \u2018closed\u2019 position. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date should be \nwritten on the inhaler label in the space provided. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date is 6 weeks from the date of opening \nthe tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first opening. \n \nAfter inhalation, patients should rinse their mouth with water without swallowing. \n \nThe step-by-step instructions shown below for the 30-dose Ellipta inhaler (30 day supply) also apply to the \n14-dose Ellipta inhaler (14 day supply). \n \nInstructions for use \n \n1. Read this before you start \n \nIf the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicine, the dose will be lost. The lost dose \nwill be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled.  \nIt is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n \n2. How to prepare a dose \n \nOpen the cover when ready to inhale a dose. Do not shake the inhaler. \n \nSlide the cover down until you hear a \u2018click\u2019. \n \nThe medicine is now ready to be inhaled. The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. \n \nIf the dose counter does not count down as you hear the \u2018click\u2019, the inhaler will not deliver medicine. Take it \nback to a pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\n \n \n3. How to inhale the medicine \n \nHold the inhaler away from your mouth and breathe out as far as is comfortable. \n \nDo not breathe out into the inhaler. \n \nPut the mouthpiece between your lips and close your lips firmly around it. \n \nDo not block the air-vents with your fingers.  \n \nTake one long, steady, deep breath in. Hold this breath for as long as possible (at least 3-4 seconds).  \n\n\uf0b7 Remove the inhaler from your mouth. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\uf0b7 Breathe out slowly and gently.  \n\n \n \nIt may not be possible to taste or feel the medicine, even when using the inhaler correctly. \n \nIf you want to clean the mouthpiece, use a dry tissue, before closing the cover. \n \n4. Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth  \n \nSlide the cover upwards as far as it will go to cover the mouthpiece. \n \nRinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow. \n \nThis will make it less likely to develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects. \n\n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDeterioration of disease \n \nFluticasone furoate/vilanterol should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or an acute exacerbation in \nCOPD, for which a short-acting bronchodilator is required.  Increasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to \nrelieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control and patients should be reviewed by a physician.  \n \nPatients should not stop therapy with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in asthma or COPD, without physician \nsupervision since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. \n \nAsthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma \nsymptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of treatment with Relvar Ellipta. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing.  This should be \ntreated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Relvar Ellipta should be discontinued \nimmediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nCardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles may \nbe seen with sympathomimetic medicinal products including Relvar Ellipta. In a placebo-controlled study in \nsubjects with moderate COPD and a history of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, there was no \nincrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in patients receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared \nwith placebo (see section 5.1). However, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be used with caution in \npatients with severe cardiovascular disease or heart rhythm abnormalities, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected \nhypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nFor patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the 92/22 micrograms dose should be used and \npatients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 5.2). \n \nSystemic corticosteroid effects \n \nSystemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long \nperiods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects \ninclude Cushing\u2019s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in bone mineral density, \ngrowth retardation in children and adolescents, cataract and glaucoma and more rarely, a range of \npsychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, \ndepression or aggression (particularly in children). \n \nFluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or \nin patients with chronic or untreated infections.  \n \nVisual disturbance  \n \nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with \nsymptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to \nan ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases \nsuch as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical \ncorticosteroids. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nHyperglycaemia \n \nThere have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and this should be \nconsidered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. \n \nPneumonia in patients with COPD \n \n \nAn increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been \nobserved in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an increased \nrisk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all \nstudies. \n \nThere is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk \namong inhaled corticosteroid products. \n \nPhysicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the \nclinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations.  \n \nRisk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass index \n(BMI) and severe COPD. \n \n \nPneumonia in patients with asthma \n \nThe incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose. The incidence of \npneumonia in patients with asthma taking fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms was numerically \nhigher compared with those receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms or placebo (see \nsection 4.8).  No risk factors were identified. \n \nExcipients \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nClinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone furoate/vilanterol at clinical doses are \nconsidered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. \n \nInteraction with beta-blockers \n \nBeta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. Concurrent use \nof both non-selective and selective beta2-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling \nreasons for their use. \n \nInteraction with CYP3A4 inhibitors \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by \nthe liver enzyme CYP3A4.  \n \nCaution is advised when co-administering with strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, \ncobicistat-containing products) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both fluticasone \nfuroate and vilanterol. Co-administration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk \nof systemic corticosteroid undesirable  effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic \ncorticosteroid undesirable effects. A repeat dose CYP3A4 drug interaction study was performed in healthy \n\n\n\n9 \n\nsubjects with the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination (184/22 micrograms) and the strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitor ketoconazole (400mg).  Co-administration increased mean fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) and Cmax by \n36% and 33%, respectively.  The increase in fluticasone furoate exposure was associated with a 27% \nreduction in 0-24 hours weighted mean serum cortisol. Co-administration increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) \nand Cmax 65% and 22%, respectively.  The increase in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an \nincrease in beta2-agonist related systemic effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QTcF interval.  \n \nInteraction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). A clinical pharmacology \nstudy in healthy subjects with co-administered vilanterol and the potent P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitor verapamil did not show any significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol. Clinical \npharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone furoate have not been conducted. \n \nSympathomimetic medicinal products \n \nConcomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of combination \ntherapy) may potentiate the adverse reactions of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol.  Relvar Ellipta should not be \nused in conjunction with other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing long-\nacting beta2-adrenergic agonists. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant (see \nsection 5.3). There are no or limited data from the use of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol trifenatate in \npregnant women. \n \nAdministration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol to pregnant women should only be considered if the \nexpected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of fluticasone furoate or vilanterol trifenatate and/or \nmetabolites in human milk. However, other corticosteroids and beta2-agonists are detected in human milk \n(see section 5.3). A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \ntrifenatate on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFluticasone furoate or vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nData from large asthma and COPD clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions \nassociated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. In the asthma clinical development program a total of 7,034 \npatients were included in an integrated assessment of adverse reactions. In the COPD clinical development \nprogramme a total of 6,237 subjects were included in an integrated assessment of adverse reactions. \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction(s) Frequency \nInfections and infestations Pneumonia*  \n\nUpper respiratory tract infection \n\nBronchitis  \n\nInfluenza \n\nCandidiasis of mouth and throat \n\nCommon \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and \nurticaria. \n\nRare \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHyperglycaemia Uncommon \n\nPsychiatric disorders Anxiety Rare \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \n\nTremor \n\nVery common \n\nRare \n\nEye disorders Vision blurred (see section 4.4) Uncommon \n\n   \n\nCardiac disorders Extrasystoles  \n\nPalpitations \n\nTachycardia \n\nUncommon \n\nRare \n\nRare \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nNasopharyngitis  \n\nParadoxical bronchospasm \n\nOropharyngeal pain \n\nSinusitis  \n\nPharyngitis \n\nRhinitis  \n\nCough  \n\nDysphonia \n\nVery common \n\nRare \n\nCommon \n\n \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia \n\nBack pain \n\nFractures**  \n\nMuscle spasms \n\nCommon \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n \n \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were headache and \nnasopharyngitis. With the exception of pneumonia and fractures, the safety profile was similar in patients \nwith asthma and COPD. During clinical studies, pneumonia and fractures were more frequently commonly \nobserved in patients with COPD.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. The following convention has been used \nfor the classification of frequencies: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n*, ** See below \u2018Description of selected adverse reactions\u2019 \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n*Pneumonia (see section 4.4) \n \nIn an integrated analysis of the two replicate one year studies in moderate to severe COPD (mean predicted \npost-bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 45%, standard deviation (SD) 13%) with an exacerbation in the \npreceding year (n = 3255), the number of pneumonia events per 1000 patient years was 97.9 with FF/VI \n184/22, 85.7 in the FF/VI 92/22 and 42.3 in the VI 22 group. For severe pneumonia the corresponding \nnumber of events per 1000 patient years were 33.6, 35.5, and 7.6 respectively, while for serious pneumonia \nthe corresponding events per 1000 patient years were 35.1 for FF/VI 184/22, 42.9 with FF/VI 92/22, 12.1 \nwith VI 22. Finally, the exposure-adjusted cases of fatal pneumonia were 8.8 for FF/VI 184/22 versus 1.5 for \nFF/VI 92/22 and 0 for VI 22.  \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study (SUMMIT) in subjects with moderate COPD (mean percent post-\nbronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60%, SD 6%), and a history of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular \ndisease, the incidence of pneumonia with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo was: adverse events (6%, 5%, 4%, 5%); \nserious adverse events (3%, 4%, 3%, 3%); adjudicated on treatment deaths due to pneumonia (0.3%, 0.2%, \n0.1%, 0.2%); the exposure adjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) were: adverse events (39.5, 42.4, 27.7, \n38.4); serious adverse events (22.4, 25.1, 16.4, 22.2); adjudicated on-treatment deaths due to pneumonia (1.8, \n1.5, 0.9, 1.4) respectively. \n \nIn an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of pneumonia per 1000 \npatient years was 18.4 for FF/VI 184/22 versus 9.6 for FF/VI 92/22 and 8.0 in the placebo group. \n \n**Fractures \n \nIn two replicate 12 month studies in a total of 3,255 patients with COPD the incidence of bone fractures \noverall was low in all treatment groups, with a higher incidence in all Relvar Ellipta groups (2%) compared \nwith the vilanterol 22 micrograms group (<1%).  Although there were more fractures in the Relvar Ellipta \ngroups compared with the vilanterol 22 micrograms group, fractures typically associated with corticosteroid \nuse (e.g., spinal compression/thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, hip and acetabular fractures) occurred in \n<1% of the Relvar Ellipta and vilanterol treatment arms. \n \nFor the SUMMIT study, the incidence of all events of fracture with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo were 2% in \neach arm; fractures commonly associated with ICS use were less than 1 % in each arm. The exposure-\nadjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) for all fracture events were 13.6, 12.8, 13.2, 11.5 respectively; \nfractures commonly associated with ICS use were 3.4, 3.9, 2.4, 2.1 respectively. \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nPyrexia Common \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of fractures was <1%, and \nusually associated with trauma. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nAn overdose of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol may produce signs and symptoms due to the individual \ncomponent\u2019s actions, including those seen with overdose of other beta2-agonists and consistent with the \nknown inhaled corticosteroid class effects (see section 4.4). \n \nTreatment \n \nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. If overdose occurs, the \npatient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  \n \nCardioselective beta-blockade should only be considered for profound vilanterol overdose effects that are \nclinically concerning and unresponsive to supportive measures. Cardioselective beta-blocking medicinal \nproducts should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. \n \nFurther management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airways diseases, adrenergics in combination with \ncorticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics ATC code: R03AK10. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a \nselective, long-acting beta2-receptor agonist). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFluticasone furoate \n \nFluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. The \nprecise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma and COPD symptoms is not known. \nCorticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. eosinophils, \nmacrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation). \n \nVilanterol trifenatate \n \nVilanterol trifenatate is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  \nThe pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist active substances, including vilanterol trifenatate, \nare at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the \nconversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). \n\n\n\n13 \n\nIncreased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of \nmediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. \n \nMolecular interactions occur between corticosteroids and LABAs, whereby steroids activate the beta2-\nreceptor gene, increasing receptor number and sensitivity and LABAs prime the glucocorticoid receptor for \nsteroid-dependent activation and enhance cell nuclear translocation. These synergistic interactions are \nreflected in enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, which has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in a range \nof inflammatory cells relevant to the pathophysiology of both asthma and COPD. In peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells from subjects with COPD, a larger anti-inflammatory effect was seen in the presence of \nthe combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with fluticasone furoate alone at concentrations \nachieved with clinical doses. The enhanced anti-inflammatory effect of the LABA component was similar to \nthat obtained with other ICS/LABA combinations. \n \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAsthma \n \nThree phase III randomised, double-blind studies (HZA106827, HZA106829 and HZA106837) of different \ndurations evaluated the safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in adult and adolescent patients \nwith persistent asthma.  All subjects were using an ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) with or without LABA for at \nleast 12 weeks prior to visit 1. In HZA106837 all patients had at least one exacerbation that required \ntreatment with oral corticosteroids in the year prior to visit 1.  HZA106827 was 12 weeks in duration and \nevaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=201] and FF 92 micrograms \n[n=205]) compared with placebo [n=203], all administered once daily. HZA106829 was 24 weeks in \nduration and evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms [n=197] and FF \n184 micrograms [n=194]) both administered once daily compared with FP 500 micrograms twice daily \n[n=195].  \n \nIn HZA106827/HZA106829 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in clinic visit \ntrough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period in all subjects and weighted \nmean serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose calculated in a subset of subjects at the end of the treatment \nperiod. Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during treatment was a \npowered secondary endpoint.

In HZA106837 patients were randomised to \nreceive either fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=1009] or FF 92 micrograms [n=1010] both \nadministered once daily.  In HZA106837 the primary endpoint was the time to first severe asthma \nexacerbation.  A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of \nsystemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due \nto asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Adjusted mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was \nalso evaluated as a secondary endpoint. \n \nIn HZA106837 the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation in patients receiving fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms was reduced by 20% compared with FF 92 micrograms alone (hazard \nratio 0.795, p=0.036 95% CI 0.642, 0.985). The rate of severe asthma exacerbations per patient per year was \n0.19 in the FF 92 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 5 years) and 0.14 in the fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 7 years).  The ratio of the exacerbation \nrate for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms versus FF 92 micrograms was 0.755 (95% CI 0.603, \n0.945). This represents a 25% reduction in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations for subjects treated with \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with FF 92 micrograms(p=0.014). The 24-hour \nbronchodilator effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was maintained throughout a one-year treatment period \nwith no evidence of loss in efficacy (no tachyphylaxis). Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms \nconsistently demonstrated 83 mL to 95 mL improvements in trough FEV1 at weeks 12, 36 and 52 and \nEndpoint compared with FF 92 micrograms (p<0.001 95% CI 52, 126 mL at Endpoint). Forty four percent of \npatients in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms group were well controlled (ACQ7 \u22640.75) at \nend of treatment compared to 36% of subjects in the FF 92 micrograms group (p<0.001 95% CI 1.23, 1.82). \n \nStudies versus salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combinations \n \nIn a 24 week study (HZA113091) in adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma both \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms given once daily in the evening and salmeterol/FP \n50/250 micrograms given twice daily demonstrated improvements from baseline in lung function. Adjusted \nmean treatment increases from baseline in weighted mean 0-24 hours FEV1 of 341 mL (fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol) and 377 mL (salmeterol/FP) demonstrated an overall improvement in lung function over \n24 hours for both treatments.  The adjusted mean treatment difference of -37 mL between the groups was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.162). For trough FEV1 subjects in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group \nachieved a LS mean change from baseline of 281 mL and subjects in the salmeterol/FP group a change of \n300 mL; (the difference in adjusted mean of -19 mL (95%CI:-0.073, 0.034) was not statistically significant \n(p=0.485). \n \nA randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 24 week study (201378) was conducted to demonstrate non-\ninferiority (using a margin of -100 mL for trough FEV1) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 once daily to \nsalmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily in adults and adolescents whose asthma was well controlled following 4 \nweeks of treatment with open-label salmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily (N=1504). Subjects randomised to \n\n\n\n15 \n\nonce-daily FF/VI maintained lung function comparable with those randomised to twice-daily salmeterol/FP \n[difference in trough FEV1 of +19 mL (95% CI: -11, 49)].  \n \nNo comparative studies versus salmeterol/FP or versus other ICS/LABA combinations have been conducted \nto appropriately compare the effects on asthma exacerbations. \n \nFluticasone furoate monotherapy \n \nA 24 week randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study (FFA112059) evaluated the safety and \nefficacy of FF 92 micrograms once daily [n= 114] and FP 250 micrograms twice daily [n=114] versus \nplacebo [n=115] in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma. All subjects had to have been on a \nstable dose of an ICS for at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1 (screening visit) and the use of LABAs was not \npermitted within 4 weeks of visit 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in clinic visit \ntrough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period. Change from baseline in \nthe percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during the 24-week treatment period was a powered secondary.  \nAt the 24-week time point FF and FP increased trough FEV1 by 146 mL (95% CI 36, 257 mL, p=0.009) and \n145 mL (95% CI 33, 257 mL, p=0.011) respectively compared to placebo. FF and FP both increased the \npercentage of 24 hour rescue free periods by 14.8% (95% CI 6.9, 22.7, p<0.001) and 17.9% (95% CI 10.0, \n25.7, p<0.001) respectively versus placebo.  \n \nAllergen challenge study \n \nThe bronchoprotective effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms on the early and late \nasthmatic response to inhaled allergen was evaluated in a repeat dose, placebo-controlled four-way crossover \nstudy (HZA113126) in patients with mild asthma.  Patients were randomized to receive fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, FF 92 micrograms, vilanterol 22 micrograms or placebo once daily for \n21 days followed by challenge with allergen 1 hour after the final dose. The allergen was house dust mite, cat \ndander, or birch pollen; the selection was based on individual screening tests.  Serial FEV1 measurements \nwere compared with pre-allergen challenge values taken after saline inhalation (baseline).  Overall, the \ngreatest effects on the early asthmatic response were seen with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n92/22 micrograms compared with FF 92 micrograms or vilanterol 22 micrograms alone. Both fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms and FF 92 micrograms virtually abolished the late asthmatic response \ncompared with vilanterol alone. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms provided significantly \ngreater protection against allergen-induced bronchial hyper-reactivity compared with monotherapies FF and \nvilanterol as assessed on Day 22 by methacholine challenge.  \n \nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  \n \nThe COPD clinical development programme included a 12-week (HZC113107), two 6-month (HZC112206, \nHZC112207), two one-year (HZC102970, HZC102871), and one >1 year study (SUMMIT). These were \nrandomised controlled studies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. These studies included \nmeasures of lung function, dyspnoea and moderate and severe exacerbations. \n \nSix month studies \n \nHZC112206 and HZC112207 were 24 week randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group \nstudies comparing the effect of the combination to vilanterol and FF alone and placebo.  HZC112206 \nevaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 46 /22 micrograms [n=206] and fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=206] compared with FF 92 micrograms [n=206], vilanterol \n22 micrograms [n=205] and placebo [n = 207], all administered once daily. HZC112207 evaluated the \nefficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=204] and fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n184/22 micrograms [n=205] compared with FF 92 micrograms [n=204], FF 184 micrograms [n=203] and \nvilanterol 22 micrograms [n=203] and placebo [n = 205], all administered once daily. \n \nAll patients were required to have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years; a post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC \nratio less than or equal to 0.70; post-salbutamol FEV1 less than or equal to 70% predicted and have a \n\n\n\n16 \n\nModified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score \uf0b32 (scale 0-4) at screening. At screening, the \nmean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 42.6% and 43.6% predicted, and the mean reversibility was 15.9% and \n12.0% in HZC112206 and HZC112207, respectively.  The co-primary endpoints in both studies were \nweighted mean FEV1 from zero to 4 hours post-dose at Day 168 and change from baseline in pre-dose trough \nFEV1 at Day 169. \n \nIn an integrated analysis of both studies, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms showed clinically \nmeaningful improvements in lung function. At Day 169 fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms and \nvilanterol increased adjusted mean trough FEV1 by 129 mL (95% CI: 91, 167 mL, p<0.001) and 83 mL (95% \nCI: 46, 121mL, p<0.001) respectively compared to placebo. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms \nincreased trough FEV1 by 46 mL compared to vilanterol (95% CI: 8, 83mL, p= 0.017). At Day 168 \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms and vilanterol increased adjusted mean weighted mean FEV1 \nover 0-4 hours by 193mL (95% CI: 156, 230 mL, p<0.001) and 145 mL (95% CI: 108, 181 mL, p<0.001) \nrespectively compared to placebo. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms increased adjusted mean \nweighted mean FEV1 over 0-4 hours by 148 ml compared to FF alone (95% CI: 112, 184 mL, p< 0.001). \n \n12 month studies \n \nStudies HZC102970 and HZC102871 were 52 week randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, studies \ncomparing the effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n92/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 46/22 micrograms with vilanterol 22 micrograms, all \nadministered once daily, on the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in subjects with COPD with a \nsmoking history of at least 10 pack years and a post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio less than or equal to 0.70 \nand post-salbutamol FEV1 less than or equal to 70% predicted and documented history of \u2265 1 COPD \nexacerbation that required antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation in the 12 months prior to \nvisit 1. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations.  Moderate/ severe \nexacerbations were defined as worsening symptoms that required treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or \nantibiotics or in-patient hospitalisation.  Both studies had a 4 week run-in period during which all subjects \nreceived open-label salmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily to standardise COPD pharmacotherapy and stabilise \ndisease prior to randomisation to blinded study medication for 52 weeks.  Prior to run-in, subjects \ndiscontinued use of previous COPD medications except short-acting bronchodilators. The use of concurrent \ninhaled long-acting bronchodilators (beta2-agonist and anticholinergic), ipratropium/salbutamol combination \nproducts, oral beta2-agonists, and theophylline preparations were not allowed during the treatment period. \nOral corticosteroids and antibiotics were allowed for the acute treatment of COPD exacerbations with \nspecific guidelines for use. Subjects used salbutamol on an as-needed basis throughout the studies.  \n \nThe results of both studies showed that treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms once \ndaily resulted in a lower annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with vilanterol \n(Table 2). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 2: Analysis of Exacerbation Rates following 12 months of treatment \n\nEndpoint \n \n\nHZC102970 HZC102871 HZC102970 and \nHZC102871 integrated \n\nVilanterol \n(n=409) \n\nfluticasone \nfuroate/  \n\nvilanterol \n92/22 \n\n(n=403) \n\nVilanterol \n(n=409) \n\nfluticasone  \nfuroate/ \n\nvilanterol  \n92/22  \n\n(n=403) \n\nVilanterol \n(n=818) \n\nfluticasone  \nfuroate/ \n\nvilanterol \n 92/22 \n\n(n=806) \nModerate and severe exacerbations \nAdjusted mean \nannual rate  \n\n1.14 0.90 1.05 0.70 1.11 0.81 \n\nRatio vs VI \n95% CI \np-value \n% reduction \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.79 \n(0.64,0.97) \n\n0.024 \n21 \n\n(3, 36) \n\n 0.66 \n(0.54, 0.81) \n\n<0.001 \n34 \n\n(19, 46) \n\n 0.73 \n(0.63, 0.84) \n\n<0.001 \n27 \n\n(16, 37) \nAbsolute \ndifference in \nnumber per \nyear vs VI \n(95% CI) \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n0.24 \n(0.03, 0.41) \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n0.36 \n(0.20, 0.48) \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n0.30 \n(0.18, 0.41) \n\nTime to first \nexacerbation: \nHazard ratio \n(95% CI) \n% risk \nreduction \n \np-value \n\n  \n \n\n0.80 \n(0.66, 0.99) \n\n20 \n \n \n\n0.036 \n\n  \n \n\n0.72 \n(0.59, 0.89) \n\n28 \n \n \n\n0.002 \n\n  \n \n\n0.76 \n(0.66, 0.88) \n\n24 \n \n \n\np<0.001 \n \nIn an integrated analysis of HZC102970 and HZC102871 at week 52, an improvement was seen when \ncomparing the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms versus vilanterol 22 micrograms in adjusted \nmean trough FEV1 (42 mL 95% CI: 19, 64mL, p<0.001). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect of fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol was maintained from the first dose throughout a one-year treatment period with no \nevidence of loss in efficacy (no tachyphylaxis). \n \nOverall, across the two studies combined 2009 (62%) patients had cardiovascular history/risk factors at \nscreening.  The incidence of cardiovascular history/risk factors was similar across the treatment groups with \npatients most commonly suffering from hypertension (46%), followed by hypercholesterolemia (29%) and \ndiabetes mellitus (12%). Similar effects in reduction of moderate and severe exacerbations were observed in \nthis subgroup as compared with the overall population. In patients with a cardiovascular history/risk factors, \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol  92/22 micrograms resulted in a significantly lower annual rate of \nmoderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with vilanterol (adjusted mean annual rates of 0.83 and 1.18 \nrespectively, 30% reduction (95% CI 16, 42%, p<0.001)). Improvements were also seen in this subgroup at \nweek 52 when comparing the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms vs. vilanterol 22 micrograms \nin adjusted mean trough FEV1 (44 mL 95% CI: 15, 73mL, (p=0.003)). \n \nStudies > 1 year duration \n \nSUMMIT was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the effect on survival of fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with placebo in 16,485 subjects. The primary endpoint was \nall-cause mortality and a secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events (on-treatment \ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or transient ischemic attack). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nPrior to randomization, subjects were required to discontinue previous COPD medications used at baseline, \nwhich included long-acting bronchodilators plus inhaled corticosteroids (28%), long-acting bronchodilators \nalone (11%) and inhaled corticosteroids alone (4%). Subjects were then randomized to receive either \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms, \nvilanterol 22 micrograms, or placebo, and treated for a mean of 1.7 years (SD = 0.9 years).  \n \nSubjects had moderate COPD (mean percent post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60% [SD = 6%]), and a \nhistory of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In the 12 months prior to the study, 61% of subjects \nreported no COPD exacerbations and 39% of subjects reported \u22651 moderate/severe COPD exacerbation. \n \nAll-cause mortality was: fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, 6.0%; placebo, 6.7%; fluticasone furoate, 6.1%; \nvilanterol, 6.4%. Exposure-adjusted all-cause mortality per 100 patients/year (%/yr) was: fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol, 3.1 %/yr; placebo, 3.5 %/yr; fluticasone furoate, 3.2 %/yr; and vilanterol, 3.4 %/yr. \nMortality risk with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was not significantly different compared with placebo (HR \n0.88; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.04; p=0.137), fluticasone furoate (HR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.15; p=0.681) or \nvilanterol (HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.09; p=0.299).  \n \nThe risk of the cardiovascular composite event with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was not significantly \ndifferent compared with placebo (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.14), fluticasone furoate (HR 1.03; 95% CI: \n0.83 to 1.28) or vilanterol (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.16).  \n \nStudies versus salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combinations \n \nIn a 12 week study (HZC113107) in COPD patients both fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms \ngiven once daily in the morning and salmeterol/FP 50/500 micrograms given twice daily, demonstrated \nimprovements from baseline in lung function. Adjusted mean treatment increases from baseline in weighted \nmean 0-24 hours FEV1 of 130 mL (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) and 108 mL (salmeterol/FP) demonstrated \nan overall improvement in lung function over 24 hours for both treatments. The adjusted mean treatment \ndifference of 22 mL (95% CI: -18, 63mL) between the groups was not statistically significant (p=0.282).  \nThe adjusted mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 on Day 85 was 111 mL in the fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol group and 88 mL in the salmeterol/FP group; the 23 mL (95% CI: -20, 66) difference \nbetween the treatment groups was not clinically meaningful or statistically significant (p=0.294). \nNo comparative studies versus salmeterol/FP or versus other established bronchodilators have been \nconducted to appropriately compare the effects on COPD exacerbations.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Relvar \nEllipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Relvar \nEllipta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absolute bioavailability for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol when administered by inhalation as \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol was on average 15.2% and 27.3%, respectively. The oral bioavailability of both \nfluticasone furoate and vilanterol was low, on average 1.26% and <2%, respectively. Given this low oral \nbioavailability, systemic exposure for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol following inhaled administration is \nprimarily due to absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. \n \nDistribution \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nFollowing intravenous dosing, both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are extensively distributed with \naverage volumes of distribution at steady state of 661 L and 165 L, respectively. \nBoth fluticasone furoate and vilanterol have a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma protein \nbinding in human plasma of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was high, on average >99.6% and 93.9%, \nrespectively. There was no decrease in the extent of in vitro plasma protein binding in subjects with renal or \nhepatic impairment. \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), however, concomitant \nadministration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with P-gp inhibitors is considered unlikely to alter fluticasone \nfuroate or vilanterol systemic exposure since they are both well absorbed molecules. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBased on in vitro data, the major routes of metabolism of both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in human \nare mediated primarily by CYP3A4. \nFluticasone furoate is primarily metabolised through hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate group to \nmetabolites with significantly reduced corticosteroid activity. Vilanterol is primarily metabolised by \nO-dealkylation to a range of metabolites with significantly reduced \uf0621- and \uf0622-agonist activity. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism with \nmetabolites being excreted almost exclusively in faeces, with <1% of the recovered radioactive dose \neliminated in the urine. \n \nFollowing oral administration, vilanterol was eliminated mainly by metabolism followed by excretion of \nmetabolites in urine and faeces approximately 70% and 30% of the radioactive dose respectively in a human \nradiolabel study conducted by the oral route. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of vilanterol \nfollowing single inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was, on average, 2.5 hours.  The \neffective half-life for accumulation of vilanterol, as determined from inhalation administration of repeat \ndoses of vilanterol 25 micrograms, is 16.0 hours in subjects with asthma and 21.3 hours in subjects with \nCOPD. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn adolescents (12 years or older), there are no recommended dose modifications. \nThe pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in patients less than 12 years of age has not been \nstudied. The safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in children under the age of 12 years has not \nyet been established.  \n \n\nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly patients (> 65 years old) \n \nThe effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were determined in phase III \nstudies in COPD and asthma. There was no evidence for age (12-84) to affect the pharmacokinetics of \nfluticasone furoate and vilanterol in subjects with asthma. \n \nThere was no evidence for age to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate in subjects with COPD \nwhile there was an increase (37%) in AUC (0-24) of vilanterol over the observed age range of 41 to 84 years. \nFor an elderly subject (aged 84 years) with low bodyweight (35 kg) vilanterol AUC (0-24) is predicted to be \n35% higher than the population estimate (subject with COPD aged 60 years and bodyweight of 70 kg), \nwhilst Cmax was unchanged. These differences are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. \nIn subjects with asthma and subjects with COPD there are no recommended dose modifications. \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nA clinical pharmacology study of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol showed that severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30mL/min) did not result in significantly greater exposure to fluticasone furoate or \nvilanterol or more marked corticosteroid or beta2-agonist systemic effects compared with healthy subjects.  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. \n \nThe effects of haemodialysis have not been studied. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was an increase in fluticasone \nfuroate systemic exposure (up to three-fold as measured by AUC(0\u201324)) in subjects with hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A, B or C) compared with healthy subjects. The increase in fluticasone furoate systemic \nexposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B; fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n184/22 micrograms) was associated with an average 34% reduction in serum cortisol compared with healthy \nsubjects. Dose-normalised fluticasone furoate systemic exposure was similar in subjects with moderate and \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). \n \nFollowing repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was no significant increase in \nsystemic exposure to vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C). \n \nThere were no clinically relevant effects of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination on beta-adrenergic \nsystemic effects (heart rate or serum potassium) in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(vilanterol, 22 micrograms) or with severe hepatic impairment (vilanterol, 12.5 micrograms) compared with \nhealthy subjects. \n \nOther special populations \n \nIn subjects with asthma, estimates of fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and South East \nAsian subjects (12-13% of subjects) were on average 33% to 53% higher compared with other racial groups. \nHowever, there was no evidence for the higher systemic exposure in this population to be associated with \ngreater effect on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion. On average, vilanterol Cmax is predicted to be 220 to \n287% higher and AUC(0-24) comparable for those subjects from an Asian heritage compared with subjects \nfrom other racial groups. However, there was no evidence that this higher vilanterol Cmax resulted in \nclinically significant effects on heart rate. \nIn subjects with COPD estimates of fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and South East \nAsian subjects (13-14% subjects) were on average 23% to 30% higher compared with Caucasian subjects. \nHowever, there was no evidence for the higher systemic exposure in this population to be associated with \ngreater effect on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion. There was no effect of race on pharmacokinetic \nparameter estimates of vilanterol in subjects with COPD. \n \nGender, weight and BMI \n \nThere was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI (body mass index) to influence the pharmacokinetics of \nfluticasone furoate based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase III data in 1213 subjects with \nasthma (712 females) and 1225 subjects with COPD (392 females).  \n \nThere was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI to influence the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in 856 subjects with asthma (500 females) and 1091 subjects with \nCOPD (340 females). \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender, weight or BMI. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nPharmacological and toxicological effects seen with fluticasone furoate or vilanterol in nonclinical studies \nwere those typically associated with either glucocorticoids or beta2-agonists. Administration of fluticasone \nfuroate combined with vilanterol did not result in any significant new toxicity. \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nFluticasone furoate \n \nFluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime \ninhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures similar to those at the maximum recommended human dose, \nbased on AUC.  \n \nVilanterol trifenatate \n \nIn genetic toxicity studies, vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic \nindicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans.  \n \nConsistent with findings for other beta2 agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate caused \nproliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. There was no \nincrease in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 2- or 30-fold, respectively, those at the maximum \nrecommended human dose, based on AUC. \n \nReproductive toxicity  \n \nFluticasone furoate \n \nEffects seen following inhalation administration of fluticasone furoate in combination with vilanterol in rats \nwere similar to those seen with fluticasone furoate alone.  \nFluticasone furoate was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused \nabortion in rabbits at maternally toxic doses. There were no effects on development in rats at exposures \napproximately 3-times greater than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. \n \nVilanterol trifenatate \n \nVilanterol trifenatate was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol trifenatate caused \neffects similar to those seen with other beta2 agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb \nflexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 84-times greater than \nthose at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. \nNeither fluticasone furoate nor vilanterol trifenatate had any adverse effects on fertility or pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment in rats. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAsthma \nRelvar Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and \nolder where use of a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is \nappropriate: \n\n\uf0b7 patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting \nbeta2-agonists. \n\n\uf0b7 patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAsthma \n \nPatients with asthma should be given the strength of Relvar Ellipta containing the appropriate fluticasone \nfuroate (FF) dosage for the severity of their disease. Prescribers should be aware that in patients with asthma, \nfluticasone furoate (FF) 100 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent to fluticasone propionate \n(FP) 250 micrograms twice daily, while FF 200 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent to FP \n500 micrograms twice daily. \n \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and over   \n \nA starting dose of one inhalation of Relvar Ellipta 92/22 micrograms once daily should be considered for \nadults and adolescents 12 years and over who require a low to mid dose of inhaled corticosteroid in \ncombination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. If patients are inadequately controlled on Relvar Ellipta \n\n\n\n25 \n\n92/22 micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional \nimprovement in asthma control. \n \nPatients should be regularly reassessed by a healthcare professional so that the strength of fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose \nshould be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. \n \nRelvar Ellipta 184/22 micrograms should be considered for adults and adolescents 12 years and over who \nrequire a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. \n \nPatients usually experience an improvement in lung function within 15 minutes of inhaling Relvar Ellipta.  \nHowever, the patient should be informed that regular daily usage is necessary to maintain control of asthma \nsymptoms and that use should be continued even when asymptomatic. \n \nIf symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be used for \nimmediate relief. \n \nThe maximum recommended dose is Relvar Ellipta 184/22 micrograms once daily. \n \nChildren aged under 12 years \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Relvar Ellipta in children under 12 years of age has not yet been established in the \nindication for asthma. \nNo data are available. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly patients (>65 years) \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nStudies in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment showed an increase in systemic \nexposure to fluticasone furoate (both Cmax and AUC) (see section 5.2). \nCaution should be exercised when dosing patients with hepatic impairment who may be more at risk of \nsystemic adverse reactions associated with corticosteroids.  \nFor patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment the maximum dose is 92/22 micrograms (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nRelvar Ellipta is for inhalation use only. \n \nIt should be administered at the same time of the day, each day.  \nThe final decision on evening or morning dosing should be left to the discretion of the physician. \n \nIf a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. \n \nIf stored in a refrigerator, the inhaler should be allowed to return to room temperature for at least an hour \nbefore use. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWhen the inhaler is used for the first time, there is no need to check that it is working properly, and to \nprepare it for use in any special way. The step-by-step instructions should be followed. \n \nThe Ellipta inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant \nsachet should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. \n \nThe patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose.  \n \nWhen the inhaler is taken out of its tray, it will be in the \u2018closed\u2019 position. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date should be \nwritten on the inhaler label in the space provided. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date is 6 weeks from the date of opening \nthe tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first opening. \n \nAfter inhalation, patients should rinse their mouth with water without swallowing. \n \nThe step-by-step instructions shown below for the 30-dose Ellipta inhaler (30 day supply) also apply to the \n14-dose Ellipta inhaler (14 day supply). \n \nInstructions for use \n \n1. Read this before you start \n \nIf the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicine, the dose will be lost. The lost dose \nwill be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled.  \nIt is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n2. How to prepare a dose \n \nOpen the cover when ready to inhale a dose. Do not shake the inhaler. \n \nSlide the cover down until you hear a \u2018click\u2019. \n \nThe medicine is now ready to be inhaled. The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. \n \nIf the dose counter does not count down as you hear the \u2018click\u2019, the inhaler will not deliver medicine. Take it \nback to a pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n \n3. How to inhale the medicine \n \nHold the inhaler away from your mouth and breathe out as far as is comfortable. \n \nDo not breathe out into the inhaler. \n \nPut the mouthpiece between your lips and close your lips firmly around it. \n \nDo not block the air-vents with your fingers.  \n \nTake one long, steady, deep breath in. Hold this breath for as long as possible (at least 3-4 seconds).  \n\n\uf0b7 Remove the inhaler from your mouth. \n\uf0b7 Breathe out slowly and gently.  \n\n \n \nIt may not be possible to taste or feel the medicine, even when using the inhaler correctly. \n \nIf you want to clean the mouthpiece, use a dry tissue, before closing the cover. \n \n \n4. Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth  \n \nSlide the cover upwards as far as it will go to cover the mouthpiece. \n \nRinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow. \n \nThis will make it less likely to develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDeterioration of disease \n \nFluticasone furoate/vilanterol should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, for which a short-acting \nbronchodilator is required.  Increasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates \ndeterioration of control and patients should be reviewed by a physician.  \n \nPatients should not stop therapy with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in asthma, without physician supervision \nsince symptoms may recur after discontinuation. \n \nAsthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma \nsymptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of treatment with Relvar Ellipta. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing.  This should be \ntreated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Relvar Ellipta should be discontinued \nimmediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nCardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles may \nbe seen with sympathomimetic medicinal products including Relvar Ellipta. In a placebo-controlled study in \nsubjects with moderate COPD and a history of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, there was no \nincrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in patients receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared \nwith placebo (see section 5.1). However, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be used with caution in \npatients with severe cardiovascular disease or heart rhythm abnormalities, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected \nhypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nFor patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the 92/22 micrograms dose should be used and \npatients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 5.2). \n \nSystemic corticosteroid effects \n \nSystemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long \nperiods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects \ninclude Cushing\u2019s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in bone mineral density, \ngrowth retardation in children and adolescents, cataract and glaucoma and more rarely, a range of \npsychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, \ndepression or aggression (particularly in children). \n \nFluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or \nin patients with chronic or untreated infections.  \n \nVisual disturbance  \n \nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with \nsymptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to \nan ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases \nsuch as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical \ncorticosteroids. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nThere have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and this should be \nconsidered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. \n \nPneumonia in patients with COPD \n \nAn increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been \nobserved in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an increased \nrisk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all \nstudies. \n \nThere is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk \namong inhaled corticosteroid products. \n \nPhysicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the \nclinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. \n \nRisk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass index \n(BMI) and severe COPD. \n \nPneumonia in patients with asthma \nThe incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose. The incidence of \npneumonia in patients with asthma taking fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms was numerically \nhigher compared with those receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms or placebo (see \nsection 4.8).  No risk factors were identified. \n \nExcipients \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nClinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone furoate/vilanterol at clinical doses are \nconsidered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. \n \nInteraction with beta-blockers \n \nBeta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. Concurrent use \nof both non-selective and selective beta2-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling \nreasons for their use. \n \nInteraction with CYP3A4 inhibitors \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by \nthe liver enzyme CYP3A4.  \n \nCaution is advised when co-administering with strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, \ncobicistat-containing products) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both fluticasone \nfuroate and vilanterol. Co-administration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk \nof systemic corticosteroid undesirable effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic \ncorticosteroid undesirable effects. A repeat dose CYP3A4 drug interaction study was performed in healthy \nsubjects with the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination (184/22 micrograms) and the strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitor ketoconazole (400mg).  Co-administration increased mean fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) and Cmax by \n36% and 33%, respectively.  The increase in fluticasone furoate exposure was associated with a 27% \nreduction in 0-24 hours weighted mean serum cortisol. Co-administration increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) \nand Cmax 65% and 22%, respectively.  The increase in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an \nincrease in beta2-agonist related systemic effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QTcF interval.  \n \nInteraction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are both substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). A clinical pharmacology \nstudy in healthy subjects with co-administered vilanterol and the potent P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitor verapamil did not show any significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol. Clinical \npharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone furoate have not been conducted. \n \nSympathomimetic medicinal products \n \nConcomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of combination \ntherapy) may potentiate the adverse reactions of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol.  Relvar Ellipta should not be \nused in conjunction with other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing long-\nacting beta2-adrenergic agonists. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant (see \nsection 5.3). There are no or limited data from the use of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol trifenatate in \npregnant women. \n \nAdministration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol to pregnant women should only be considered if the \nexpected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of fluticasone furoate or vilanterol trifenatate and/or \nmetabolites in human milk. However, other corticosteroids and beta2-agonists are detected in human milk \n(see section 5.3). A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \ntrifenatate on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFluticasone furoate or vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nData from large asthma and COPD clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions \nassociated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. In the asthma clinical development program a total of 7,034 \npatients were included in an integrated assessment of adverse reactions. In the COPD clinical development \nprogramme a total of 6,237 subjects were included in an integrated assessment of adverse reactions. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were headache and \nnasopharyngitis. With the exception of pneumonia and fractures, the safety profile was similar in patients \nwith asthma and COPD. During clinical studies, pneumonia and fractures were more frequently commonly \nobserved in patients with COPD.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency.

For severe pneumonia the corresponding \nnumber of events per 1000 patient years were 33.6, 35.5, and 7.6 respectively, while for serious pneumonia \nthe corresponding events per 1000 patient years were 35.1 for FF/VI 184/22, 42.9 with FF/VI 92/22, 12.1 \nwith VI 22. Finally, the exposure-adjusted cases of fatal pneumonia were 8.8 for FF/VI 184/22 versus 1.5 for \nFF/VI 92/22 and 0 for VI 22.  \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study (SUMMIT) in subjects with moderate COPD (mean percent post-\nbronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60%, SD 6%), and a history of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular \ndisease, the incidence of pneumonia with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo was: adverse events (6%, 5%, 4%, 5%); \nserious adverse events (3%, 4%, 3%, 3%); adjudicated on treatment deaths due to pneumonia (0.3%, 0.2%, \n0.1%, 0.2%); the exposure adjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) were: adverse events (39.5, 42.4, 27.7, \n38.4); serious adverse events (22.4, 25.1, 16.4, 22.2); adjudicated on-treatment deaths due to pneumonia (1.8, \n1.5, 0.9, 1.4) respectively. \n \nIn an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of pneumonia per 1000 \npatient years was 18.4 for FF/VI 184/22 versus 9.6 for FF/VI 92/22 and 8.0 in the placebo group. \n \n**Fractures \n \nIn two replicate 12 month studies in a total of 3,255 patients with COPD the incidence of bone fractures \noverall was low in all treatment groups, with a higher incidence in all Relvar Ellipta groups (2%) compared \nwith the vilanterol 22 micrograms group (<1%).  Although there were more fractures in the Relvar Ellipta \ngroups compared with the vilanterol 22 micrograms group, fractures typically associated with corticosteroid \nuse (e.g., spinal compression/thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, hip and acetabular fractures) occurred in \n<1% of the Relvar Ellipta and vilanterol treatment arms. \n \nFor the SUMMIT study, the incidence of all events of fracture with FF/VI, FF, VI and placebo were 2% in \neach arm; fractures commonly associated with ICS use were less than 1 % in each arm. The exposure-\nadjusted rates (per 1000 treatment years) for all fracture events were 13.6, 12.8, 13.2, 11.5 respectively; \nfractures commonly associated with ICS use were 3.4, 3.9, 2.4, 2.1 respectively. \n \nIn an integrated analysis of 11 studies in asthma (7,034 patients), the incidence of fractures was <1%, and \nusually associated with trauma. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nAn overdose of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol may produce signs and symptoms due to the individual \ncomponent\u2019s actions, including those seen with overdose of other beta2-agonists and consistent with the \nknown inhaled corticosteroid class effects (see section 4.4). \n \nTreatment \n \nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. If overdose occurs, the \npatient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  \n \nCardioselective beta-blockade should only be considered for profound vilanterol overdose effects that are \nclinically concerning and unresponsive to supportive measures. Cardioselective beta-blocking medicinal \nproducts should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nFurther management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airways diseases, adrenergics in combination with \ncorticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics ATC code: R03AK10. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a \nselective, long-acting beta2-receptor agonist). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFluticasone furoate \n \nFluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. The \nprecise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma and COPD symptoms is not known. \nCorticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. eosinophils, \nmacrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation). \n \nVilanterol trifenatate \n \nVilanterol trifenatate is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  \nThe pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist active substance, including vilanterol trifenatate, \nare at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the \nconversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). \nIncreased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of \nmediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. \n \nMolecular interactions occur between corticosteroids and LABAs, whereby steroids activate the beta2-\nreceptor gene, increasing receptor number and sensitivity and LABAs prime the glucocorticoid receptor for \nsteroid-dependent activation and enhance cell nuclear translocation. These synergistic interactions are \nreflected in enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, which has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in a range \nof inflammatory cells relevant to the pathophysiology of both asthma and COPD. In peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells from subjects with COPD, a larger anti-inflammatory effect was seen in the presence of \nthe combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with fluticasone furoate alone at concentrations \nachieved with clinical doses. The enhanced anti-inflammatory effect of the LABA component was similar to \nthat obtained with other ICS/LABA combinations. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAsthma \n \nThree phase III randomised, double-blind studies (HZA106827, HZA106829 and HZA106837) of different \ndurations evaluated the safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in adult and adolescent patients \nwith persistent asthma.  All subjects were using an ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) with or without LABA for at \nleast 12 weeks prior to visit 1. In HZA106837 all patients had at least one exacerbation that required \ntreatment with oral corticosteroids in the year prior to visit 1.  HZA106827 was 12 weeks in duration and \nevaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=201] and FF 92 micrograms \n[n=205]) compared with placebo [n=203], all administered once daily. HZA106829 was 24 weeks in \nduration and evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms [n=197] and FF \n\n\n\n35 \n\n184 micrograms [n=194]) both administered once daily compared with FP 500 micrograms twice daily \n[n=195].  \n \nIn HZA106827/HZA106829 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in clinic visit \ntrough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period in all subjects and weighted \nmean serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose calculated in a subset of subjects at the end of the treatment \nperiod. Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during treatment was a \npowered secondary endpoint.  Results for the primary and key secondary endpoints in these studies are \ndescribed in Table 1. \n\nTable 1 - Results of primary and key secondary endpoints in HZA106827 and HZA106829 \n\nStudy No. HZA106829 HZA106827 \nTreatment Dose of \nFF/VI*(micrograms) \n\nFF/VI 184/22 \nOnce Daily vs \nFF 184 Once \n\nDaily \n\nFF/VI 184/22 \nOnce Daily \nvs FP 500 \n\nTwice Daily \n\nFF/VI 92/22 \nOnce Daily \n\nvs FF 92 \nOnce Daily \n\nFF/VI 92/22 \nOnce Daily \nvs placebo \nOnce Daily \n\nChange from Baseline in Trough FEV1 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) \nTreatment difference \nP value  \n(95% CI)  \n\n193mL \np<0.001 \n\n(108, 277) \n\n210mL \np<0.001 \n\n(127, 294) \n\n36mL \np=0.405 \n\n(-48, 120) \n\n172mL \np<0.001 \n(87, 258) \n\nWeighted Mean Serial FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose \nTreatment difference \nP value \n(95% CI) \n\n136mL \np=0.048 \n(1, 270) \n\n206mL \np=0.003 \n(73, 339) \n\n116mL \np=0.06 \n\n(-5, 236) \n\n302mL \np<0.001 \n\n(178, 426) \nChange from Baseline in Percentage of Rescue-Free 24-hour Periods \nTreatment difference \nP value  \n(95% CI) \n\n11.7% \np<0.001 \n\n(4.9, 18.4) \n\n6.3% \np=0.067 \n\n(-0.4, 13.1) \n\n10.6% \np<0.001 \n\n(4.3, 16.8) \n\n19.3% \np<0.001 \n\n(13.0, 25.6) \nChange from Baseline in Percentage of Symptom-Free 24-hour Periods \nTreatment difference \nP value  \n(95% CI) \n\n8.4% \np=0.010 \n\n(2.0, 14.8) \n\n4.9% \np=0.137 \n\n(-1.6, 11.3) \n\n12.1% \np<0.001 \n\n(6.2, 18.1) \n\n18.0% \np<0.001 \n\n(12.0, 23.9) \nChange from Baseline in AM Peak Expiratory Flow \nTreatment difference \nP value  \n(95% CI) \n\n33.5L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(22.3, 41.7) \n\n32.9L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(24.8, 41.1) \n\n14.6L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(7.9, 21.3) \n\n33.3L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(26.5, 40.0) \nChange from Baseline in PM Peak Expiratory Flow \nTreatment difference \nP value  \n(95% CI) \n\n30.7L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(22.5, 38.9) \n\n26.2L/min  \np<0.001 \n\n(18.0, 34.3) \n\n12.3L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(5.8, 18.8) \n\n28.2L/min \np<0.001 \n\n(21.7, 34.8) \n*FF/VI = fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n \nHZA106837 was of variable treatment duration (from a minimum of 24 weeks to a maximum of 76 weeks \nwith the majority of patients treated for at least 52 weeks).  In HZA106837 patients were randomised to \nreceive either fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms [n=1009] or FF 92 micrograms [n=1010] both \nadministered once daily.  In HZA106837 the primary endpoint was the time to first severe asthma \nexacerbation.  A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of \nsystemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due \nto asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Adjusted mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was \nalso evaluated as a secondary endpoint. \n \nIn HZA106837 the risk of experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation in patients receiving fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms was reduced by 20% compared with FF 92 micrograms alone (hazard \nratio 0.795, p=0.036 95% CI 0.642, 0.985). The rate of severe asthma exacerbations per patient per year was \n0.19 in the FF 92 group (approximately 1 in every 5 years) and 0.14 in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n\n\n\n36 \n\n92/22 micrograms group (approximately 1 in every 7 years).  The ratio of the exacerbation rate for \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms versus FF 92 was 0.755 (95% CI 0.603, 0.945). This \nrepresents a 25% reduction in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations for subjects treated with fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with FF 92 (p=0.014). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect of \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol was maintained throughout a one-year treatment period with no evidence of \nloss in efficacy (no tachyphylaxis). Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92 /22 micrograms consistently \ndemonstrated 83 mL to 95 mL improvements in trough FEV1 at weeks 12, 36 and 52 and Endpoint compared \nwith FF 92 micrograms (p<0.001 95% CI 52, 126 mL at Endpoint).  Forty four percent of patients in the \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 group were well controlled (ACQ7 \u22640.75) at end of treatment compared \nto 36% of subjects in the FF 92 micrograms group (p<0.001 95% CI 1.23, 1.82). \n \nStudies versus salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combinations \n \nIn a 24 week study (HZA113091) in adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma both \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms given once daily in the evening and salmeterol/FP \n50/250 micrograms given twice daily demonstrated improvements from baseline in lung function. Adjusted \nmean treatment increases from baseline in weighted mean 0-24 hours FEV1 of 341 mL (fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol) and 377 mL (salmeterol/FP) demonstrated an overall improvement in lung function over \n24 hours for both treatments.  The adjusted mean treatment difference of -37 mL between the groups was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.162). For trough FEV1 subjects in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group \nachieved a LS mean change from baseline of 281 mL and subjects in the salmeterol/FP group a change of \n300 mL; (the difference in adjusted mean of -19 mL (95%CI:-0.073, 0.034) was not statistically significant \n(p=0.485). \n \nA randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 24 week study (201378) was conducted to demonstrate non-\ninferiority (using a margin of -100 mL for trough FEV1) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 once daily to \nsalmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily in adults and adolescents whose asthma was well controlled following 4 \nweeks of treatment with open-label salmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily (N=1504). Subjects randomised to \nonce-daily FF/VI maintained lung function comparable with those randomised to twice-daily salmeterol/FP \n[difference in trough FEV1 of +19 mL (95% CI: -11, 49)].  \n \nNo comparative studies versus salmeterol/FP or versus other ICS/LABA combinations have been conducted \nto appropriately compare the effects of asthma exacerbations. \n \nFluticasone furoate monotherapy \n \nA 24 week randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study (FFA112059) evaluated the safety and \nefficacy of FF 92 micrograms once daily [n= 114] and FP 250 micrograms twice daily [n=114] versus \nplacebo [n=115] in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma.  All subjects had to have been on a \nstable dose of an ICS for at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1 (screening visit) and the use of LABAs was not \npermitted within 4 weeks of visit 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in clinic visit \ntrough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the treatment period. Change from baseline in \nthe percentage of rescue-free 24 hour periods during the 24-week treatment period was a powered secondary.  \nAt the 24-week time point FF and FP increased trough FEV1 by 146 mL (95% CI 36, 257 mL, p=0.009) and \n145 mL (95% CI 33, 257 mL, p=0.011) respectively compared to placebo. FF and FP both increased the \npercentage of 24 hour rescue free periods by 14.8% (95% CI 6.9, 22.7, p<0.001) and 17.9% (95% CI 10.0, \n25.7, p<0.001) respectively versus placebo.  \n \nAllergen challenge study \n \nThe bronchoprotective effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms on the early and late \nasthmatic response to inhaled allergen was evaluated in a repeat dose, placebo-controlled four-way crossover \nstudy (HZA113126) in patients with mild asthma.  Patients were randomized to receive fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, FF 92 micrograms, vilanterol 22 micrograms or placebo once daily for \n21 days followed by challenge with allergen 1 hour after the final dose. The allergen was house dust mite, cat \ndander, or birch pollen; the selection was based on individual screening tests.  Serial FEV1 measurements \n\n\n\n37 \n\nwere compared with pre-allergen challenge values taken after saline inhalation (baseline).  Overall, the \ngreatest effects on the early asthmatic response were seen with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n92/22 micrograms compared with FF 92 micrograms or vilanterol 22 micrograms alone. Both fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms and FF 92 micrograms virtually abolished the late asthmatic response \ncompared with vilanterol alone. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms provided significantly \ngreater protection against allergen-induced bronchial hyper-reactivity compared with monotherapies FF and \nvilanterol as assessed on Day 22 by methacholine challenge. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Relvar \nEllipta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absolute bioavailability for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol when administered by inhalation as \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol was on average 15.2% and 27.3%, respectively. The oral bioavailability of both \nfluticasone furoate and vilanterol was low, on average 1.26% and <2%, respectively. Given this low oral \nbioavailability, systemic exposure for fluticasone furoate and vilanterol following inhaled administration is \nprimarily due to absorption of the inhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous dosing, both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are extensively distributed with \naverage volumes of distribution at steady state of 661 L and 165 L, respectively. \nBoth fluticasone furoate and vilanterol have a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma protein \nbinding in human plasma of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was high, on average >99.6% and 93.9%, \nrespectively. There was no decrease in the extent of in vitro plasma protein binding in subjects with renal or \nhepatic impairment. \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), however, concomitant \nadministration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with P-gp inhibitors is considered unlikely to alter fluticasone \nfuroate or vilanterol systemic exposure since they are both well absorbed molecules. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBased on in vitro data, the major routes of metabolism of both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in human \nare mediated primarily by CYP3A4. \nFluticasone furoate is primarily metabolised through hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate group to \nmetabolites with significantly reduced corticosteroid activity. Vilanterol is primarily metabolised by \nO-dealkylation to a range of metabolites with significantly reduced \uf0621- and \uf0622-agonist activity. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism with \nmetabolites being excreted almost exclusively in faeces, with <1% of the recovered radioactive dose \neliminated in the urine. \n \nFollowing oral administration, vilanterol was eliminated mainly by metabolism followed by excretion of \nmetabolites in urine and faeces approximately 70% and 30% of the radioactive dose respectively in a human \nradiolabel study conducted by the oral route. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of vilanterol \nfollowing single inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was, on average, 2.5 hours.  The \neffective half-life for accumulation of vilanterol, as determined from inhalation administration of repeat \n\n\n\n38 \n\ndoses of vilanterol 25 micrograms, is 16.0 hours in subjects with asthma and 21.3 hours in subjects with \nCOPD. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn adolescents (12 years or older), there are no recommended dose modifications. \nThe pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in patients less than 12 years of age has not been \nstudied. The safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in children under the age of 12 years has not \nyet been established.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly patients (> 65 years old) \n \nThe effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol were determined in phase III \nstudies in COPD and asthma. There was no evidence for age (12-84) to affect the pharmacokinetics of \nfluticasone furoate and vilanterol in subjects with asthma. \n \nIn subjects with asthma and subjects with COPD there are no recommended dose modifications. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nA clinical pharmacology study of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol showed that severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30mL/min) did not result in significantly greater exposure to fluticasone furoate or \nvilanterol or more marked corticosteroid or beta2-agonist systemic effects compared with healthy subjects.  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. \n \nThe effects of haemodialysis have not been studied. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was an increase in fluticasone \nfuroate systemic exposure (up to three-fold as measured by AUC(0\u201324)) in subjects with hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A, B or C) compared with healthy subjects. The increase in fluticasone furoate systemic \nexposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B; fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n184/22 micrograms) was associated with an average 34% reduction in serum cortisol compared with healthy \nsubjects. Dose-normalised fluticasone furoate systemic exposure was similar in subjects with moderate and \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). \n \nFollowing repeat dosing of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was no significant increase in \nsystemic exposure to vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C). \n \nThere were no clinically relevant effects of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination on beta-adrenergic \nsystemic effects (heart rate or serum potassium) in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(vilanterol, 22 micrograms) or with severe hepatic impairment (vilanterol, 12.5 micrograms) compared with \nhealthy subjects. \n \nOther special populations \n \nIn subjects with asthma, estimates of fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) for East Asian, Japanese and South East \nAsian subjects (12-13% of subjects) were on average 33% to 53% higher compared with other racial groups. \nHowever, there was no evidence for the higher systemic exposure in this population to be associated with \ngreater effect on 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion. On average, vilanterol Cmax is predicted to be 220 to \n\n\n\n39 \n\n287% higher and AUC(0-24) comparable for those subjects from an Asian heritage compared with subjects \nfrom other racial groups. However, there was no evidence that this higher vilanterol Cmax resulted in \nclinically significant effects on heart rate. \n \nGender, weight and BMI \n \nThere was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI (body mass index) to influence the pharmacokinetics of \nfluticasone furoate based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase III data in 1213 subjects with \nasthma (712 females).  \n \nThere was no evidence for gender, weight or BMI to influence the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in 856 subjects with asthma (500 females). \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender, weight or BMI. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPharmacological and toxicological effects seen with fluticasone furoate or vilanterol in nonclinical studies \nwere those typically associated with either glucocorticoids or beta2-agonists. Administration of fluticasone \nfuroate combined with vilanterol did not result in any significant new toxicity. \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nFluticasone furoate \n \nFluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime \ninhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures similar to those at the maximum recommended human dose, \nbased on AUC.  \n \nVilanterol trifenatate \n \nIn genetic toxicity studies, vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic \nindicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans.  \n \nConsistent with findings for other beta2 agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate caused \nproliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. There was no \nincrease in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 2- or 30-fold, respectively, those at the maximum \nrecommended human dose, based on AUC. \n \nReproductive toxicity  \n \nFluticasone furoate \n \nEffects seen following inhalation administration of fluticasone furoate in combination with vilanterol in rats \nwere similar to those seen with fluticasone furoate alone.  \nFluticasone furoate was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused \nabortion in rabbits at maternally toxic doses. There were no effects on development in rats at exposures \napproximately 3-times greater than those at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. \n \nVilanterol trifenatate \n \nVilanterol trifenatate was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol trifenatate caused \neffects similar to those seen with other beta2 agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb \nflexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 84-times greater than \nthose at the maximum recommended human dose, based on AUC. \n\n\n\n40 \n\nNeither fluticasone furoate nor vilanterol trifenatate had any adverse effects on fertility or pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment in rats. \n \n \n6.

Two different strengths of \nRelvar Ellipta are available: fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms/vilanterol 22 micrograms and fluticasone \nfuroate 184 micrograms/vilanterol 22 micrograms.  \n \nThe 92/22 micrograms strength is used for the regular treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD) in adults, and asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years and over.  \n \nThe 184/22 micrograms strength is used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. \nThe 184/22 micrograms strength is not approved for the treatment of COPD. \n \n Relvar Ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or         \n\nother symptoms of COPD and asthma. It should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of \nbreathlessness or wheezing. If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as \nsalbutamol). If you do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. \n\n \nFluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called steroids. \nCorticosteroids reduce inflammation. They reduce the swelling and irritation in the small air passages in the \nlungs and so gradually ease breathing problems. Corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma and \naggravation of COPD. \n \nVilanterol belongs to a group of medicines called long acting bronchodilators. It relaxes the muscles of the \nsmall air passages in the lungs. This helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of \nthe lungs. When it is taken regularly, it helps the small air passages to remain open. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nWhen you take these two active substances together regularly, they will help to control your breathing \ndifficulties more than either medicine alone. \n \nAsthma is a serious, long term lung disease where the muscles surrounding the smaller airways become tight \n(bronchoconstriction) and swollen and irritated (inflammation). Symptoms come and go and include \nshortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. Relvar Ellipta has been shown to reduce flare-ups \nand symptoms of asthma.  \n \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious, long term lung disease where the airways \nbecome inflamed and thickened. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest discomfort and \ncoughing up mucus. Relvar Ellipta has been shown to reduce flare-ups of COPD symptoms. \n \n \n2.

This dose is also used once \ndaily at the same time each day. \n \nCOPD \nThe recommended dose to treat COPD is one inhalation (92 micrograms of fluticasone furoate and \n22 micrograms of vilanterol) once daily at the same time each day. \n \nThe higher strength of Relvar Ellipta (184 micrograms fluticasone furoate and 22 micrograms of vilanterol) \nis not suitable for the treatment of COPD. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nRelvar Ellipta is for inhalation use.  \n \nUse Relvar Ellipta at the same time each day as it is effective over 24 hours \nIt is very important that you use this medicine every day, as instructed by your doctor. This will help to keep \nyou free of symptoms throughout the day and night. \n \nRelvar Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. If you get \nthis sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol). \n \nIf you feel you are getting breathless or wheezy more often than normal, or if you are using your quick-\nacting inhaler more than usual, see your doctor. \n \nHow to use Relvar Ellipta \nSee \u2018Step-by-step instructions\u2019 after section 6 of this leaflet for full information. \n \nYou do not need to prepare Relvar Ellipta in any special way, not even the first time you use it. \n \nIf your symptoms do not improve \nIf your symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough) do not improve or get worse, or if you are using your \nquick-acting inhaler more often:  \n \n  contact your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you use more Relvar Ellipta than you should  \nIf you accidentally take more Relvar Ellipta than your doctor has instructed, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist. You may notice that your heart is beating faster than usual, you feel shaky or have a headache. \n  \nIf you have used more than instructed for a long period of time, it is particularly important that you \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. This is because larger doses of Relvar Ellipta may reduce the \namount of steroid hormones produced naturally by your body.  \n \nIf you forget to use Relvar Ellipta  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take your next dose at the usual time. \n \nIf you become wheezy or breathless, or develop any other symptoms of an asthma attack, use your \nquick-acting inhaler (e.g. salbutamol), then seek medical advice.  \n \nDo not stop using Relvar Ellipta without advice \nUse this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. It will only be effective as long as you are using it. \nDo not stop unless your doctor advises you to, even if you feel better. \n \nIf you have further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n4.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what relvar ellipta is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "relvar ellipta contains two active substances: fluticasone furoate and vilanterol. two different strengths of relvar ellipta are available: fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms/vilanterol 22 micrograms and fluticasone furoate 184 micrograms/vilanterol 22 micrograms. the 92/22 micrograms strength is used for the regular treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in adults, and asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years and over. the 184/22 micrograms strength is used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. the 184/22 micrograms strength is not approved for the treatment of copd. relvar ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or other symptoms of copd and asthma. it should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. if you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol). if you do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called steroids. corticosteroids reduce inflammation. they reduce the swelling and irritation in the small air passages in the lungs and so gradually ease breathing problems. corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma and aggravation of copd. vilanterol belongs to a group of medicines called long acting bronchodilators. it relaxes the muscles of the small air passages in the lungs. this helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. when it is taken regularly, it helps the small air passages to remain open. when you take these two active substances together regularly, they will help to control your breathing difficulties more than either medicine alone. asthma is a serious, long term lung disease where the muscles surrounding the smaller airways become tight (bronchoconstriction) and swollen and irritated (inflammation). symptoms come and go and include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. relvar ellipta has been shown to reduce flare-ups and symptoms of asthma. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a serious, long term lung disease where the airways become inflamed and thickened. symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest discomfort and coughing up mucus. relvar ellipta has been shown to reduce flare-ups of copd symptoms.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "relvar ellipta", "Type":

relvar ellipta see 'step-by-step instructions' after section 6 of this leaflet for full information. you do not need to prepare relvar ellipta in any special way, not even the first time you use it.

make up for a forgotten dose. just take your next dose at the usual time. if you become wheezy or breathless, or develop any other symptoms of an asthma attack, use your quick-acting inhaler (e.g. salbutamol), then seek medical advice. do not stop using relvar ellipta without advice use this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. it will only be effective as long as you are using it.
