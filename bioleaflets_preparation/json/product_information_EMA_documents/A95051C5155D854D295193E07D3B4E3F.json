CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRybelsus is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus\nto improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise\n\n• as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or \ncontraindications\n\n• in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.\n\nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe starting dose of semaglutide is 3 mg once daily for one month. After one month, the dose should \nbe increased to a maintenance dose of 7 mg once daily. After at least one month with a dose of 7 mg \nonce daily, the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily to further improve \nglycaemic control.\n\nThe maximum recommended single daily dose of semaglutide is 14 mg. Taking two 7 mg tablets to \nachieve the effect of a 14 mg dose has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.\n\nFor information on switching between oral and subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide, see section 5.2.\n\nWhen semaglutide is used in combination with metformin and/or a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 \ninhibitor (SGLT2i) or thiazolidinedione, the current dose of metformin and/or SGLT2i or \nthiazolidinedione can be continued.\n\nWhen semaglutide is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, a reduction in the dose \nof sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4 and \n4.8).\n\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose is not needed in order to adjust the dose of semaglutide. Blood \nglucose self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulfonylurea and insulin, particularly when \nsemaglutide is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin reduction is \nrecommended.\n\nMissed dose\nIf a dose is missed, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken the following \nday. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients ≥75 years of age is \nlimited (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. \nExperience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe renal impairment is limited. \nSemaglutide is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n4\n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Experience with the use of \nsemaglutide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when \ntreating these patients with semaglutide (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Rybelsus in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nRybelsus is a tablet for once-daily oral use. \n\n– This medicinal product should be taken on an empty stomach at any time of the day.\n– It should be swallowed whole with a sip of water (up to half a glass of water equivalent to\n\n120 ml). Tablets should not be split, crushed or chewed, as it is not known whether this impacts \nabsorption of semaglutide.\n\n– Patients should wait at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking or taking other oral medicinal \nproducts. Waiting less than 30 minutes decreases the absorption of semaglutide (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nGeneral\n\nSemaglutide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of \ndiabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in insulin-dependent patients whom had \nrapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin when treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist is \nstarted (see section 4.2).\n\nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart \nAssociation (NYHA) class IV and semaglutide is therefore not recommended in these patients.\n\nThere is no therapeutic experience with semaglutide in patients with bariatric surgery.\n\nGastrointestinal effects\n\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions that can \ncause dehydration, which in rare cases can lead to a deterioration of renal function (see section 4.8). \nPatients treated with semaglutide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to \ngastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\n\nAcute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients should be \ninformed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, semaglutide\nshould be discontinued; if confirmed, semaglutide should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised \nin patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n5\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nPatients treated with semaglutide in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the \ndose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating treatment with semaglutide (see section 4.2).\n\nDiabetic retinopathy\n\nIn patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with insulin and s.c. semaglutide, an increased risk of \ndeveloping diabetic retinopathy complications has been observed, a risk that cannot be excluded for \norally administered semaglutide (see data in section 4.8). Caution should be exercised when using \nsemaglutide in patients with diabetic retinopathy. These patients should be monitored closely and \ntreated according to clinical guidelines. Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated \nwith a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, but other mechanisms cannot be excluded. Long-\nterm glycaemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nTreatment response\n\nCompliance with the dosing regimen is recommended for optimal effect of semaglutide. If the \ntreatment response with semaglutide is lower than expected, the treating physician should be aware \nthat the absorption of semaglutide is highly variable and may be minimal (2-4% of patients will not \nhave any exposure), and that the absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is low.\n\nSodium content\n\nThis medicinal product contains 23 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 1% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSemaglutide delays gastric emptying which may influence the absorption of other oral medicinal \nproducts.\n\nEffects of semaglutide on other medicinal products\n\nThyroxine\nTotal exposure (AUC) of thyroxine (adjusted for endogenous levels) was increased by 33% following \nadministration of a single dose of levothyroxine. Maximum exposure (Cmax) was unchanged. \nMonitoring of thyroid parameters should be considered when treating patients with semaglutide at the \nsame time as levothyroxine.\n\nWarfarin\nSemaglutide did not change the AUC or Cmax of R- and S-warfarin following a single dose of warfarin, \nand the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin as measured by the international normalised ratio (INR) \nwere not affected in a clinically relevant manner. However, upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in \npatients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended.\n\nRosuvastatin\nAUC of rosuvastatin was increased by 41% [90% CI: 24; 60] when co-administered with semaglutide. \nBased on the wide therapeutic index of rosuvastatin the magnitude of changes in the exposure in not \nconsidered clinically relevant.\n\nDigoxin, oral contraceptives, metformin, furosemide\nNo clinically relevant change in AUC or Cmax of digoxin, oral contraceptives (containing \nethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel), metformin or furosemide was observed when concurrently \nadministered with semaglutide.\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n6\n\nInteractions with medicinal products with very low bioavailability (F: 1%) have not been evaluated.\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on semaglutide\n\nOmeprazole\nNo clinically relevant change in AUC or Cmax of semaglutide was observed when taken with \nomeprazole.\n\nIn a trial investigating the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide co-administered with five other tablets, the \nAUC of semaglutide decreased by 34% and Cmax by 32%. This suggests that the presence of multiple \ntablets in the stomach influences the absorption of semaglutide if co-administered at the same time.\nAfter administering semaglutide, the patients should wait 30 minutes before taking other oral \nmedicinal products (see section 4.2).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with \nsemaglutide.\n\nPregnancy\n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). There are limited data from the \nuse of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. \nIf a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, semaglutide should be discontinued. \nSemaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-\nlife (see section 5.2).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIn lactating rats, semaglutide, salcaprozate sodium and/or its metabolites were excreted in milk. As a \nrisk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded, Rybelsus should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effect of semaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. Semaglutide did not affect male fertility \nin rats. In female rats, an increase in oestrous length and a small reduction in number of ovulations \nwere observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSemaglutide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When it is used in \ncombination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid \nhypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn 10 phase 3a trials, 5,707 patients were exposed to semaglutide alone or in combination with other \nglucose-lowering medicinal products. The duration of the treatment ranged from 26 weeks to \n78 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were gastrointestinal \ndisorders, including nausea (very common), diarrhoea (very common) and vomiting (common).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n7\n\nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified in all phase 3a trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(further described in section 5.1). The frequencies of the adverse reactions are based on a pool of the \nphase 3a trials excluding the cardiovascular outcomes trial.\n\nThe reactions are listed below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined \nas: very common: (≥1/10); common: (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon: (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare: \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare: (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions from controlled phase 3a trials\nMedDRA \nsystem organ \nclass\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare\n\nImmunesystem \ndisorders \n\nAnaphylactic \nreaction\n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypoglycaemia \nwhen used with \ninsulin or \nsulfonylureaa\n\nHypoglycaemia \nwhen used with \nother oral \nantidiabetic \nproductsa\n\nDecreased \nappetite\n\nEye disorders Diabetic \nretinopathy \ncomplicationsb\n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\nIncreased heart \nrate \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea\nDiarrhoea\n\nVomiting\nAbdominal pain\nAbdominal\ndistension\nConstipation\nDyspepsia\nGastritis\nGastro-\noesophageal \nreflux disease\nFlatulence\n\nEructation Acute \npancreatitis\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nCholelithiasis\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n\nInvestigations Increased lipase\nIncreased \namylase\n\nWeight \ndecreased\n\na) Hypoglycaemia defined as blood glucose <3.0 mmol/L or <54 mg/dL\nb) Diabetic retinopathy complications is a composite of retinal photocoagulation, treatment with intravitreal agents, vitreous \nhaemorrhage and diabetes-related blindness (uncommon). Frequency is based on the cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. \nsemaglutide, but it cannot be excluded that the risk of diabetic retinopathy complications identified also applies to Rybelsus.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypoglycaemia\nSevere hypoglycaemia was primarily observed when semaglutide was used with a sulfonylurea \n(<0.1% of subjects, <0.001 events/patient year) or insulin (1.1% of subjects, 0.013 events/patient \n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n8\n\nyear). Few episodes (0.1% of subjects, 0.001 events/patient year) were observed with semaglutide in \ncombination with oral antidiabetics other than sulfonylurea.\n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions\nNausea occurred in 15%, diarrhoea in 10%, and vomiting in 7% of patients when treated with \nsemaglutide. Most events were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration. The events led to \ntreatment discontinuation in 4% of subjects. The events were most frequently reported during the first \nmonths on treatment.\n\nAcute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication has been reported in phase 3a trials, semaglutide \n(<0.1%) and comparator (0.2%). In the cardiovascular outcomes trial the frequency of acute \npancreatitis confirmed by adjudication was 0.1% for semaglutide and 0.2% for placebo (see section \n4.4.)\n\nDiabetic retinopathy complications\nA 2-year clinical trial with s.c. semaglutide investigated 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes, with high \ncardiovascular risk, long duration of diabetes and poorly controlled blood glucose. In this trial, \nadjudicated events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in more patients treated with s.c. \nsemaglutide (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). This was observed in insulin-treated patients with \nknown diabetic retinopathy. The treatment difference appeared early and persisted throughout the trial. \nSystematic evaluation of diabetic retinopathy complication was only performed in the cardiovascular \noutcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide. In clinical trials with Rybelsus of up to 18 months duration \ninvolving 6,352 patients with type 2 diabetes, adverse events related to diabetic retinopathy were \nreported in similar proportions in subjects treated with semaglutide (4.2%) and comparators (3.8%).\n\nImmunogenicity\nConsistent with the potential immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or \npeptides, patients may develop antibodies following treatment with semaglutide. The proportion of \nsubjects tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any time point after baseline was low (0.5%) \nand no subjects had neutralising anti-semaglutide antibodies or anti-semaglutide antibodies with\nneutralising effect on endogenous GLP-1 at end-of-trial.\n\nHeart rate increase\nIncreased heart rate has been observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In the phase 3a trials, mean \nchanges of 0 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline of 69 to 76 were observed in patients treated \nwith Rybelsus.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nEffects of overdose with semaglutide in clinical studies may be associated with gastrointestinal \ndisorders. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to \nthe patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. A prolonged period of observation and treatment of the \nsymptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of semaglutide of approximately 1 \nweek (see section 5.2). There is no specific antidote for overdose with semaglutide. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\n005260949 1.0\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, \nATC code: A10BJ06\n\nMechanism of action\n\nSemaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as \na GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for \nnative GLP-1.\n\nGLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions in glucose and appetite regulation, and in \nthe cardiovascular system. The glucose and appetite effects are specifically mediated via GLP-1 \nreceptors in the pancreas and the brain.\n\nSemaglutide reduces blood glucose in a glucose-dependent manner by stimulating insulin secretion \nand lowering glucagon secretion when blood glucose is high. The mechanism of blood glucose \nlowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase. During \nhypoglycaemia, semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. The \nmechanism of semaglutide is independent of the route of administration.\n\nSemaglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass through lowered energy intake, involving an \noverall reduced appetite. In addition, semaglutide reduces the preference for high fat foods.\n\nGLP-1 receptors are expressed in the heart, vasculature, immune system and kidneys. Semaglutide has\na beneficial effect on plasma lipids, lowers systolic blood pressure and reduces inflammation in \nclinical studies. In animal studies, semaglutide attenuates the development of atherosclerosis by \npreventing aortic plaque progression and reducing inflammation in the plaque.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nThe pharmacodynamic evaluations described below were performed with orally administered \nsemaglutide after 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nFasting and postprandial glucose\nSemaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, \ntreatment with semaglutide resulted in a relative reduction compared to placebo of 22% [13; 30] for \nfasting glucose and 29% [19; 37] for postprandial glucose.\n\nGlucagon secretion\nSemaglutide lowers the postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, \nsemaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo: \npostprandial glucagon response of 29% [15; 41].\n\nGastric emptying\nSemaglutide causes a minor delay in early postprandial gastric emptying, with paracetamol exposure \n(AUC0-1h) 31% [13; 46] lower in the first hour after the meal, thereby reducing the rate at which \nglucose appears in the circulation postprandially.\n\nFasting and postprandial lipids\nSemaglutide compared to placebo lowered fasting triglyceride and very-low-density lipoproteins \n(VLDL) cholesterol concentrations by 19% [8; 28] and 20% [5; 33], respectively. The postprandial \ntriglyceride and VLDL cholesterol response to a high fat meal was reduced by 24% [9; 36] and 21%\n[7; 32], respectively. ApoB48 was reduced both in fasting and postprandial state by 25% [2; 42] and \n30% [15; 43], respectively.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Rybelsus have been evaluated in eight global randomised controlled phase \n3a trials. In seven trials, the primary objective was the assessment of the glycaemic efficacy; in one \ntrial, the primary objective was the assessment of cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe trials included 8,842 randomised patients with type 2 diabetes (5,169 treated with semaglutide), \nincluding 1,165 patients with moderate renal impairment. Patients had an average age of 61 years \n(range 18 to 92 years), with 40% of patients ≥ 65 years of age and 8% ≥ 75 years of age. The efficacy \nof semaglutide was compared with placebo or active controls (sitagliptin, empagliflozin and \nliraglutide).\n\nThe efficacy of semaglutide was not impacted by baseline age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight, \nBMI, diabetes duration, upper gastrointestinal disease and level of renal function.\n\nPIONEER 1 – Monotherapy\nIn a 26-week double-blind trial, 703 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and \nexercise were randomised to semaglutide 3 mg, semaglutide 7 mg, semaglutide 14 mg or placebo once \ndaily.\n\nTable 2 Results of a 26-week monotherapy trial comparing semaglutide with placebo \n(PIONEER 1)\n\nSemaglutide\n7 mg\n\nSemaglutide\n14 mg\n\nPlacebo\n\nFull analysis set (N) 175 175 178\n\nHbA1c (%)\n\nBaseline 8.0 8.0 7.9\n\nChange from baseline1 −1.2 −1.4 −0.3\n\nDifference from placebo1 [95% CI] −0.9 [−1.1; −0.6]* −1.1 [−1.3; −0.9]* -\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c <7.0% 69§ 77§ 31\n\nFPG (mmol/L)\n\nBaseline 9.0 8.8 8.9\n\nChange from baseline1 −1.5 −1.8 −0.2\n\nDifference from placebo1 [95% CI] −1.4 [−1.9; −0.8]§ −1.6 [−2.1; −1.2]§ -\n\nBody weight (kg)\n\nBaseline 89.0 88.1 88.6\n\nChange from baseline1 −2.3 −3.7 −1.4\n\nDifference from placebo1 [95% CI] −0.9 [−1.9; 0.1] −2.3 [−3.1; −1.5]* -\n1 Irrespective of treatment discontinuation or initiation of rescue medication (pattern mixture model using multiple \nimputation). * p<0.001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority, controlled for multiplicity. § p<0.05, not controlled for \nmultiplicity; for ‘Patients achieving HbA1c <7.0%’, the p-value is for the odds ratio.\n\nPIONEER 2 – Semaglutide vs. empagliflozin, both in combination with metformin\nIn a 52-week open-label trial, 822 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to semaglutide 14 mg\nonce daily or empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, both in combination with metformin.\n\nTable 3 Results of a 52-week trial comparing semaglutide with empagliflozin (PIONEER 2)\nSemaglutide\n\n14 mg\nEmpagliflozin\n\n25 mg\n\nFull analysis set (N) 411 410\n\nWeek 26\n\nHbA1c (%) \n\nBaseline 8.1 8.1\n\nChange from baseline1 −1.3 −0.9\n\nDifference from empagliflozin1 [95% CI] −0.4 [−0.6; −0.3]* -\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c <7.0% 67§ 40\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n11\n\nFPG (mmol/L) \n\nBaseline 9.5 9.7\n\nChange from baseline1 −2.0 −2.0\n\nDifference from empagliflozin1 [95% CI] 0.0 [−0.2; 0.3] -\n\nBody weight (kg) \n\nBaseline 91.9 91.3\n\nChange from baseline1 −3.8 −3.7\n\nDifference from empagliflozin1 [95% CI] −0.1 [−0.7; 0.5] -\n\nWeek 52\n\nHbA1c (%)\n\nChange from baseline1 −1.3 −0.9\n\nDifference from empagliflozin1 [95% CI] −0.4 [−0.5; −0.3]§ -\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c <7.0% 66§ 43\n\nBody weight (kg)\n\nChange from baseline1 −3.8 −3.6\n\nDifference from empagliflozin1 [95% CI] −0.2 [−0.9; 0.5] -\n1 Irrespective of treatment discontinuation or initiaton of rescue medicaton (pattern mixture model using multiple \nimputation). * p<0.001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority, controlled for multiplicity. § p<0.05, not controlled for \nmultiplicity; for ‘Patients achieving HbA1c <7.0%’, the p-value is for the odds ratio.\n\nPIONEER 3 – Semaglutide vs. sitagliptin, both in combination with metformin or metformin with \nsulfonylurea\nIn a 78-week, double-blind, double-dummy trial, 1,864 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised \nto semaglutide 3 mg, semaglutide 7 mg, semaglutide 14 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, all in \ncombination with metformin alone or metformin and sulfonylurea.

Medical history included stroke (11.7%) and myocardial \ninfarction (36.1%).\n\nThe total number of first MACE was 137: 61 (3.8%) with semaglutide and 76 (4.8%) with placebo.\nThe analysis of time to first MACE resulted in a HR of 0.79 [0.57; 1.11]95% CI.\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n15\n\nTime from randomisation (week)\n\nNumber of subjects at risk\n\nP\nro\n\npo\nrt\n\nio\nn\n o\n\nf \nsu\n\nb\nje\n\nct\ns \n\n(%\n)\n\nRybelsus\n\nPlacebo\n\nRybelsus Placebo\n\nHR: 0.79\n95% CI 0.57; 1.11\n\nCumulative incidence plot of primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) with \nnon-cardiovascular death as competing risk. \nAbbreviations: CI: Confidence interval, HR: Hazard ratio\n\nFigure 1 Cumulative incidence of first occurrence of MACE in PIONEER 6\n\nThe treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint and its components in the PIONEER 6 trial is \nshown in Figure 2.\n\nPrimary endpoint – MACE\n\nComponents of MACE\n\nFAS\n\nCardiovascular death\n\nNon-fatal stroke\n\nNon-fatal myocardial infarction\n\nOther secondary endpoints\n\nAll cause death\n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI)\n\nRybelsus\nN (%)\n\nPlacebo\nN (%)\n\nFavours Rybelsus Favours placebo\n\n0.2 51\n\n0.51\n(0.31-0.84)\n\n23\n(1.4)\n\n45\n(2.8)\n\n1.18\n(0.73-1.90)\n\n37\n(2.3)\n\n31\n(1.9)\n\n0.74\n(0.35-1.57)\n\n12\n(0.8)\n\n16\n(1.0)\n\n0.49\n(0.27-0.92)\n\n15\n(0.9)\n\n30\n(1.9)\n\n0.79\n(0.57-1.11)\n\n61\n(3.8)\n\n76\n(4.8)\n\n1591\n(100)\n\n1592\n(100)\n\nFigure 2 Treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint, its components and all cause death \n(PIONEER 6)\n\nBody weight\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n16\n\nBy end-of-treatment, 27-45% of the patients had achieved a weight loss of ≥5% and 6-16% had \nachieved a weight loss of ≥10% with semaglutide, compared with 12-39% and 2-8%, respectively, \nwith the active comparators. \n\nBlood pressure\n\nTreatment with semaglutide had reduced systolic blood pressure by 2-7 mmHg.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRybelsus in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nOrally administered semaglutide has a low absolute bioavailability and a variable absorption. Daily \nadministration according to the recommended posology in combination with a long half-life reduces \nday-to-day fluctuation of the exposure.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of semaglutide have been extensively characterised in healthy subjects and \npatients with type 2 diabetes. Following oral administration, maximum plasma concentration of \nsemaglutide occurred 1 hour post dose. Steady-state exposure was reached after 4–5 weeks of once-\ndaily administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the average steady-state concentrations were\napproximately 6.7 nmol/L and 14.6 nmol/L with semaglutide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively; with 90% \nof subjects treated with semaglutide 7 mg having an average concentration between 1.7 and \n22.7 nmol/L and 90% of subjects treated with semaglutide 14 mg having an average concentration \nbetween 3.7 and 41.3 nmol/L. Systemic exposure of semaglutide increased in a dose-proportional \nmanner.\n\nBased on in vitro data, salcaprozate sodium facilitates absorption of semaglutide. The absorption of \nsemaglutide predominantly occurs in the stomach.\n\nThe estimated bioavailability of semaglutide is approximately 1% following oral administration. The \nbetween-subject variability in absorption was high (coefficient of variation was approximately 100%). \nThe estimation of the within-subject variability in bioavailability was not reliable.\n\nAbsorption of semaglutide is decreased if taken with food or large volumes of water. A longer post-\ndose fasting period results in higher absorption.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe estimated absolute volume of distribution is approximately 8 L in subjects with type 2 diabetes. \nSemaglutide is extensively bound to plasma proteins (>99%).\n\nBiotransformation\n\nSemaglutide is metabolised through proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-\noxidation of the fatty acid sidechain. The enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is expected to be \ninvolved in the metabolism of semaglutide.\n\nElimination\n\nThe primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and faeces. \nApproximately 3% of the absorbed dose is excreted as intact semaglutide via the urine.\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n17\n\nWith an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation \nfor about 5 weeks after the last dose. The clearance of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes is \napproximately 0.04 L/h.\n\nSwitching between oral and subcutaneous (s.c.) administration\n\nThe effect of switching between oral and s.c. semaglutide cannot easily be predicted because of the \nhigh pharmacokinetic variability of oral semaglutide. Exposure after oral semaglutide 14 mg once \ndaily is comparable to s.c. semaglutide 0.5 mg once weekly. An oral dose equivalent to 1.0 mg of s.c. \nsemaglutide has not been established.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nAge had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on data from clinical trials, which \nstudied patients up to 92 years of age.\n\nGender\nGender had no clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide.\n\nRace and ethnicity\nRace (White, Black or African-American, Asian) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or\nLatino) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide.\n\nBody weight\nBody weight had an effect on the exposure of semaglutide. Higher body weight was associated with\nlower exposure. Semaglutide provided adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of \n40-188 kg evaluated in the clinical trials.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal impairment did not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner. \nThe pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were evaluated in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment and patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis compared with subjects with normal \nrenal function in a study with 10 consecutive days of once-daily doses of semaglutide. This was also \nshown for subjects with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment based on data from phase 3a studies.\n\nHepatic impairment\nHepatic impairment did not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant \nmanner. The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were evaluated in patients with mild, moderate or\nsevere hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function in a study with 10 \nconsecutive days of once-daily doses of semaglutide.\n\nUpper GI tract disease\nUpper GI tract disease (chronic gastritis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease) did not impact the \npharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner. The pharmacokinetics were \nevaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without upper GI tract disease dosed for 10 \nconsecutive days with once-daily doses of semaglutide. This was also shown for subjects with type 2 \ndiabetes and upper GI tract disease based on data from phase 3a studies.\n\nPaediatric population\nSemaglutide has not been studied in paediatric patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity.\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n18\n\nNon-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours observed in rodents are a class effect for GLP-1 receptor agonists. \nIn 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, semaglutide caused thyroid C-cell tumours at \nclinically relevant exposures. No other treatment-related tumours were observed. The rodent C-cell \ntumours are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor mediated mechanism to which \nrodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is considered to be low, but cannot be \ncompletely excluded.\n\nIn fertility studies in rats, semaglutide did not affect mating performance or male fertility. In female \nrats, an increase in oestrous cycle length and a small reduction in corpora lutea (ovulations) were \nobserved at doses associated with maternal body weight loss.\n\nIn embryo-foetal development studies in rats, semaglutide caused embryotoxicity below clinically \nrelevant exposures. Semaglutide caused marked reductions in maternal body weight and reductions in \nembryonic survival and growth. In foetuses, major skeletal and visceral malformations were observed, \nincluding effects on long bones, ribs, vertebrae, tail, blood vessels and brain ventricles. Mechanistic \nevaluations indicated that the embryotoxicity involved a GLP-1 receptor mediated impairment of the \nnutrient supply to the embryo across the rat yolk sac. Due to species differences in yolk sac anatomy \nand function, and due to the lack of GLP-1 receptor expression in the yolk sac of non-human primates, \nthis mechanism is considered unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, a direct effect of \nsemaglutide on the foetus cannot be excluded.\n\nIn developmental toxicity studies in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, increased pregnancy loss and \nslightly increased incidence of foetal abnormalities were observed at clinically relevant exposures. The \nfindings coincided with marked maternal body weight loss of up to 16%. Whether these effects are \nrelated to the decreased maternal food consumption as a direct GLP-1 effect is unknown.\n\nPostnatal growth and development were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. Infants were slightly \nsmaller at delivery, but recovered during the lactation period.\n\nIn juvenile rats, semaglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females. These \ndelays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, or on the ability of the \nfemales to maintain pregnancy.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n– Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n– This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n– If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Rybelsus is and what it is used for \n2.

What Rybelsus is and what it is used for\n\nRybelsus contains the active substance semaglutide. It is a medicine that is used to lower blood sugar \nlevels.\n\nRybelsus is used to treat adults (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise \nis not enough:\n• on its own – when you cannot use metformin (another diabetes medicine) or\n• with other medicines for diabetes – when the other medicines are not enough to control your \n\nblood sugar levels. These may be medicines you take by mouth or inject such as insulin.\n\nIt is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as agreed with your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that \nyour body makes does not lower your blood sugar the way it should. In some cases, your body can \nproduce too much blood sugar. If your blood sugar increases and remains high over a long period of \ntime, this can lead to harmful effects such as heart problems, kidney disease, eye disorders and poor \ncirculation in your limbs. That is why it is important to keep your blood sugar levels within a normal \nrange.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rybelsus\n\nDo not take Rybelsus\n\n005260949 1.0\n\n\n\n35\n\n• if you are allergic to semaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rybelsus.\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, record the name and the lot \nnumber (included on the outer cartons and blister) of the medicine you are taking and provide this \ninformation when reporting any side effects.\n\nGeneral:\nThis medicine is not the same as insulin and you should not use it if:\n• you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin)\n• you develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, \n\nbreathing difficulty, confusion, excessive thirst, a sweet smell to the breath or a sweet or \nmetallic taste in the mouth.\n\nStomach and gut problems\nDuring treatment with this medicine, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have \ndiarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you drink \nenough fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney problems. Talk \nto your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nSevere and on-going stomach pain which could be due to an inflamed pancreas\nIf you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area – see a doctor straight away as this could be \na sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis).\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\nTaking a sulfonylurea medicine or insulin with Rybelsus might increase the risk of getting low blood \nsugar (hypoglycaemia). See section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar levels. \n\nYour doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help to decide if the dose of the \nsulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low blood sugar.\n\nDiabetic eye disease (retinopathy)\nFast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of diabetic eye disease. \nIf you have diabetic eye disease and get eye problems while taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.\n\nTreatment response\nIf the treatment response with semaglutide is lower than expected, this may be due to low absorption \ncaused by variability in absorption and low absolute bioavailability. You should follow the \ninstructions given in section 3 for optimal effect of semaglutide.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents aged under 18 years as the safety and \nefficacy in this age group have not been established.\n\nOther medicines and Rybelsus\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing any of the \nfollowing:\n• levothyroxine which is used for thyroid disease.

If you become pregnant while using this medicine, talk to your \ndoctor straight away, as your treatment will need to be changed.\n\nDo not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIf you use this medicine in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar \n(hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Do not drive or use\nmachines if you get any signs of low blood sugar.
