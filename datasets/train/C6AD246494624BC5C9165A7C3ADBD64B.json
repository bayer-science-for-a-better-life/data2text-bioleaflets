NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNonafact 100 IU/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNonafact contains 100 IU/ml (500 IU/5ml or 1000 IU/10ml) human coagulation factor IX when \nreconstituted with 5 ml or 10 ml, respectively, of water for injections. \n \nEach vial contains 500 IU or 1000 IU of human coagulation factor IX.  \n \nThe potency (IU) is determined using a method equivalent to the test method described in the \nEuropean Pharmacopoeia. The specific activity of Nonafact is at least 200 IU/mg protein. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. White powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX \ndeficiency).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia. \n \nThe dose and the duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency. \nOther determining factors are the site and extent of the haemorrhage and the patient\u2019s clinical \ncondition. \n \nThe number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current International Standard for factor IX concentrate as approved by the WHO. Factor \nIX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in \nInternational Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is related to the quantity of factor IX in the \nInternational Standard for factor II, VII, IX and X in human plasma (approved by the WHO) which \napproximates to the quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma. The calculation of the \nrequired dosage of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor IX \nper kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 1.1 % of normal activity. The required \ndosage is determined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (%) (IU/dl) x 0.9 \n \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of treatment should always be determined on the \nbasis of clinical effectiveness in the individual patient. Factor IX products rarely require to be \nadministered more than once daily. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be \nused to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage / Type of \nsurgical procedure \n\nFactor IX level \nrequired (%) \n\n(IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/Duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding \n\n20-40 Repeat every 24 hours. At least 1 \nday, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or \nhealing is achieved. \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n30-60 Repeat infusion every 24 hours for \n3-4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved. \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages 60-100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor  \nincluding tooth extraction \n\n30-60 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved. \n\n \nMajor  80-100 \n\n(pre- and \npostoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8-24 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy for at least another 7 days to \nmaintain a factor IX activity of 30 % \nto 60 % (IU/dl). \n\n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the \ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major surgical \ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis \n(plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor \nIX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.  \n \nFor long-term prophylaxis of haemorrhages in patients with severe haemophilia B, doses of 20 to 40 \nIU of factor IX per kilogram of body weight could be given at intervals of 3 to 4 days.  \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Nonafact in children less than 6 years of age has not been established. \nThere are insufficient data to recommend the use of Nonafact in children less than 6 years of age. \n \nPatients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors. If the expected factor IX \nactivity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an \nassay should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present. In patients with high levels \nof inhibitor, factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients \nwith haemophilia, see also 4.4. \n \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMethod of administration \nThe product should be administered via the intravenous route. It is recommended that the rate of \nadministration should not exceed 2 ml/min. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product \nbefore administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; \n- Hypersensitivity to mouse proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. The \nproduct contains traces of mouse proteins. Patients should be informed of the early signs of \nhypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and \nanaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product \nimmediately and contact their physician.  \nIn case of shock, the current medical standards for shock-treatment should be observed. \n \nSince the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development \nof thromboembolic complications, the risk being higher in low purity preparations, the use of factor \nIX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in \npatients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Because of the potential risk of thrombotic \ncomplications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy \nshould be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with \nliver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic \nphenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with Nonafact should be \nweighed against the risk of these complications. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of virus. Despite this, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are \nadministered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also \napplies to unknown or emerging viruses or other pathogens. \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and \nfor the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated \nreceipt of plasma-derived factor IX concentrates. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Nonafact is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the product.  \n \nAfter repeated treatment with Nonafact, patients should be monitored for the development of \nneutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using appropriate \nbiological testing. \n \nThere have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX \ninhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated \nfor the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an \nincreased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. \nBecause of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of \nfactor IX should, according to the treating physician\u2019s judgement, be performed under medical \nobservation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.  \n \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium- \nfree\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of Nonafact with other medicinal products are known. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. Based on the rare occurrence of \nhaemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if \nclearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNonafact has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \ninfrequently in patients treated with factor IX containing products. In some case, these reactions have \nprogressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association with \ndevelopment of factor IX inhibitors (see also 4.4).  \n \nNephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction on \nhaemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction. \n \nOn rare occasions, fever has been observed. \nHaemophilia B patients may develop antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such inhibitors occur, the \ncondition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that \na specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. During clinical trials with Nonafact conducted in \npreviously treated patients development of inhibitors was not reported. There is no experience of the \ntreatment of previously untreated patients with Nonafact. \n \nThere is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX \nproducts, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has \nbeen associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, \nvenous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with \nsuch side effects.  \n \nNonafact contains trace amounts (< 0.1 ng mouse IgG/IU of factor IX) of the murine monoclonal \nantibody used in its purification. In theory, therefore, the use of Nonafact could generate antibodies to \nmouse protein. The clinical relevance of antibodies to mouse protein, if these do indeed arise, is not \nknown. \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see 4.4. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with human coagulation factor IX have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic Group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX. ATC code: B02BD04. \n \nFactor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 68,000 Dalton. It is a \nvitamin K-dependent coagulation factor and is synthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor \nXIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway and by the factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic \npathway. Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated \nfactor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot \nis formed. Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased \nlevels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels \nof factor IX are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor IX deficiency and \ncorrection of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nThere are insufficient data to recommend the use of Nonafact in children less than 6 years of age. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe in vivo increase in factor IX levels obtained with Nonafact is 1.1 IU/dl per IU administered per kg \nbody weight, which corresponds to an in vivo recovery of 49 %. Nonafact has a half-life of \napproximately 19 (17 \u2013 21) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPlasma coagulation factor IX is a normal constituent of human plasma. Factor IX in this product \ntherefore behaves like endogenous factor IX. Conventional animal toxicity studies and mutagenicity \nstudies with plasma coagulation factor IX were not carried out. In pharmacodynamic studies in rabbits \nand guinea pigs, the thrombogenicity of Nonafact was shown to be minimal. \n \n \n6.

WHAT NONAFACT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nNonafact can be administered to prevent and treat bleeding in patients suffering from haemophilia B (a \ncongenital lack of active factor IX). Factor IX is a normal constituent of human blood. A deficiency of \nfactor IX causes blood coagulation problems, which may lead to bleeding in joints, muscles or internal \norgans. The administration of Nonafact can compensate for this deficiency. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE NONAFACT \n \nDo not use Nonafact: \n \n- if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance, human coagulation factor IX. \n- if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to any of the other ingredients or to mouse proteins. \n \nTake special care with Nonafact: \n \nSee your doctor immediately, if bleeding does not stop as expected. \n \nAfter it has been dissolved in the supplied water for injections, the product should be clear. Check this \nimmediately prior to administration. The product must not be administered if any cloudiness, lumps or \nparticulate matter are visible. \n \nIn rare cases, Nonafact can give rise to a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock). If, after \nadministration, you develop hypersensitive reactions like hives, itching and rash, chest tightness, \nwheezing and light headedness contact your physician immediately. If you have previously \nexperienced hypersensitivity in response to the administration of blood or a blood product, Nonafact \n\n18 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nshould only be administered when absolutely necessary (in life-threatening situations). This must be \ncarried out in hospital or under the careful supervision of a doctor. \n \nIndividuals with haemophilia B who receive factor IX preparations, should be monitored for the \ndevelopment of neutralising antibodies against factor IX (inhibitors) (see Possible side effects). Your \ndoctor will check your blood regularly for the presence of these antibodies, especially if you \nexperienced a severe allergic reaction with the previous use of a factor IX product. \nThe occurrence of activity-neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) is a very rare event in previously treated \npatients receiving factor IX-containing products.  \n \nThere is a slight risk that higher doses of Nonafact will cause clots to form in blood vessels, resulting \nin thrombosis. If you suffer from a liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had surgery, there is \nan increased risk for coagulation complications. This also applies to newborn babies and patients with \nan increased risk of thrombosis or \u201cDIC\u201d, disseminated intravascular coagulation, a disease in which \nthe blood coagulation system is disturbed. Your doctor will consider whether administration of \nNonafact imposes a risk for coagulation complications. \n \nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to \nmake sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools \nof plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the \nprocessing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when \nmedicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on \ninfection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other \ntypes of infections  \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A and \nparvovirus B19 viruses. \n \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you \nregularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived coagulation factor IX \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Nonafact the name and batch number \nof the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nThere is no experience of the treatment of previously untreated patients with Nonafact. \n \nUse in children \n \nThere are insufficient data to recommend the use of Nonafact in children less than 6 years of age. \n \nUsing other medicines: \n \nThere are no known interactions between Nonafact and other medicinal products. \nPlease inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \neven those not prescribed. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding: \n \nBased on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX \nduring pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX should be used by pregnant \nor breast-feeding women only if clearly indicated. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines: \n \n\n19 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nNonafact has no known effects on the ability to drive and to use machines. \n \nInformation about some of the ingredients of Nonafact: \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium- \nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE NONAFACT \n \nDosage: \n \nYour doctor will decide how much Nonafact you require. The exact dose will depend on the \nseriousness of the clinical situation, your body weight and the amount of factor IX in your blood. If \nyou have to undergo surgery or have a tooth extracted, inform your doctor or dentist that you have \nfactor IX deficiency. They will then ensure that factor IX is administered to you, should this prove \nnecessary. \n \nNonafact is given to you by your doctor or nurse. Nonafact may be self administered if it is an \napproved practice in your country and when you have been trained sufficiently. Always use Nonafact \nexactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not \nsure. \n \nIt is important that the concentration of factor IX in your blood is checked regularly. If you are \nadministered 1 IU per kilogram of body weight, the concentration of factor IX in your blood will \nincrease by 1.1 % of normal activity. \n \nThe required dosage is determined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (%) (IU/dl) x 0.9 \n \nYour doctor will determine the dose of Nonafact you need and how frequently you should use it  \ndepending on the situation. The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and \nsurgery: \n \n\nDegree of bleeding / Type of \nsurgical procedure \n\nFactor IX level \nrequired (%) \n\n(IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/Duration \nof therapy (days) \n\nBleeding   \n\nEarly signs of bleeding in joints, \nmuscle bleeding or oral bleeding \n\n20-40 Repeat every 24 hours. At least 1 \nday, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or \nhealing is achieved. \n\nMore extensive bleeding in joints, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n30-60 Repeat infusion every 24 hours for \n3-4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved. \n\nLife threatening bleeding 60-100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor  \nincluding tooth extraction \n\n30-60 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved. \n\n20 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nMajor \n\n  \n\n80-100 \n\n(pre- and \npostoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8-24 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy for at least another 7 days.  \n\n \nDuring the course of treatment it is advised that the concentrations of factor IX in your blood are \nchecked regularly. Particularly with major surgery, it is important that the concentrations of factor IX \nin your blood are checked carefully before and after the operation. \n \nFor long-term prevention of bleeding in individuals with severe haemophilia B, doses of 20 IU to 40 \nIU of factor IX per kilogram body weight should be given at intervals of 3 to 4 days. In some cases, \nespecially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of Nonafact is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor. \nIndividuals with haemophilia B may develop antibodies (inhibitors) against factor IX. As a result, the \nfactor IX product used becomes inactivated (see Possible side effects). It is advised that the treatment \nof this serious condition be taken care of in a haemophilia treating centre where an appropriate dose \nwill be determined. The administration of factor IX can repress these inhibitors. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \nDissolving the powder \n \nThe powder should be dissolved in the supplied amount of water for injections. The solution should \nnot be too cold when it is administered. In addition, the powder will dissolve more readily if both vials \nare first allowed to reach room temperature (15\u00b0C \u2013 25\u00b0C). \n \n1. Remove from the refrigerator and allow the two vials to reach room temperature (15\u00b0C \u2013 25\u00b0C). \n2. Remove the plastic cap from the vials. \n3. Disinfect the surface of the stoppers of both vials with a gauze soaked in 70 % alcohol. \n4. Remove the protective sheath from one end of a transfer needle and pierce the stopper of the \n\nvial containing water for injections. Remove the protective sheath from the other end of the \ntransfer needle. Invert the solvent vial and pierce the stopper of the vial containing the powder. \n\n5. Tilt the product vial when transferring the solvent to allow the solvent to flow down the side of \nthe vial. \n\n6. Remove the empty vial and the transfer needle. \n7. Swirl the vial gently to completely dissolve the powder. Do not shake! The powder dissolves \n\nwithin 5 minutes to produce a clear, colourless to light-yellow solution. \n \nImmediately before administration, the solution should be inspected: the solution should be clear and \nmust be free of lumps. Once dissolved, the product should be used immediately (at least within 3 \nhours). \n \nNonafact should never be mixed with other medicinal products. \n \nAdministration \n \n1. Using a hypodermic needle and syringe, draw the dissolved product out of the vial. \n2. Nonafact should be injected into a vein (intravenous administration). \n3. Inject the dissolved product very gradually (approx. 2 ml per minute). \n \nDisposal \n \nAny unused product or waste material must be discarded as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n21 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nDuration of treatment: \n \nHaemophilia B is a chronic disease, therefore lifelong treatment with a factor IX product may be \nnecessary. \n \nIf you use more Nonafact than you should: \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with human coagulation factor IX have been reported. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nAs with all medicinal products derived from human blood, the use of Nonafact can cause allergic \nreactions which may include swelling of the larynx, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, \nflushing, hives, itching and rash, headache, tiredness, nausea, restlessness, fast heart beat, chest \ntightness, tingling, vomiting, wheezing. \nYou should discuss the possible side effects with your doctor in order to know how to recognise them \nand what to do if they occur. Where necessary, mild allergic reactions, such as hives, can be treated \nwith antihistamines (medicinal products which counteract allergies). In the case of a severe allergic \nreaction (anaphylactic shock), immediately stop the administration of the product and contact your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nThere is a very slight risk that Nonafact will cause clots to form in blood vessels, resulting in \nthrombosis. The use of Nonafact may also produce an increase in body temperature in rare cases.  \n \nYour body may develop antibodies (inhibitors) against factor IX, which will inactivate Nonafact. Your \ndoctor will check your blood regularly for the presence of these antibodies. Contact your doctor \nimmediately if you suspect that the product is becoming progressively less effective. This will show \nitself as an increased tendency to bleed. \n \nIf you need therapy for repressing antibodies (inhibitors) this should be taken care of in a haemophilia \ntreating centre. You will be closely monitored for any possible side effect during this treatment. \n \nIf you should experience one of these side effects, you are advised to contact your doctor. If you notice \nany side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE NONAFACT \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the label and carton. \nStore in a refrigerator (at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C ).  \n \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  \nFrom a microbiological point of view the product, once dissolved, should be used immediately, but no \nlonger than 3 hours after reconstitution. \n \nBefore administration, check that the solution is clear. The product must not be used if any cloudiness, \nlumps or particulate matter are visible. \n \n \n6.

how to use nonafact", "Section_Content": "dosage: your doctor will decide how much nonafact you require. the exact dose will depend on the seriousness of the clinical situation, your body weight and the amount of factor ix in your blood. if you have to undergo surgery or have a tooth extracted, inform your doctor or dentist that you have factor ix deficiency. they will then ensure that factor ix is administered to you, should this prove necessary. nonafact is given to you by your doctor or nurse. nonafact may be self administered if it is an approved practice in your country and when you have been trained sufficiently. always use nonafact exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. it is important that the concentration of factor ix in your blood is checked regularly. if you are administered 1 iu per kilogram of body weight, the concentration of factor ix in your blood will increase by 1.1 % of normal activity. the required dosage is determined using the following formula: required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor ix rise (%) (iu/dl) x 0.9 your doctor will determine the dose of nonafact you need and how frequently you should use it depending on the situation. the following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: degree of bleeding / type of surgical procedure factor ix level required (%) (iu/dl) frequency of doses (hours)/duration of therapy (days) bleeding early signs of bleeding in joints, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding 20-40 repeat every 24 hours. at least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved. more extensive bleeding in joints, muscle bleeding or haematoma 30-60 repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved. life threatening bleeding 60-100 repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved. surgery minor including tooth extraction 30-60 every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved. major 80-100 (pre- and postoperative) repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until adequate wound healing, then therapy for at least another 7 days. during the course of treatment it is advised that the concentrations of factor ix in your blood are checked regularly. particularly with major surgery, it is important that the concentrations of factor ix in your blood are checked carefully before and after the operation. for long-term prevention of bleeding in individuals with severe haemophilia b, doses of 20 iu to 40 iu of factor ix per kilogram body weight should be given at intervals of 3 to 4 days. in some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. if you have the impression that the effect of nonafact is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor. individuals with haemophilia b may develop antibodies (inhibitors) against factor ix. as a result, the factor ix product used becomes inactivated (see possible side effects). it is advised that the treatment of this serious condition be taken care of in a haemophilia treating centre where an appropriate dose will be determined. the administration of factor ix can repress these inhibitors. instructions for use: dissolving the powder the powder should be dissolved in the supplied amount of water for injections. the solution should not be too cold when it is administered. in addition, the powder will dissolve more readily if both vials are first allowed to reach room temperature (15 25). 1. remove from the refrigerator and allow the two vials to reach room temperature (15 25). 2. remove the plastic cap from the vials. 3. disinfect the surface of the stoppers of both vials with a gauze soaked in 70 % alcohol. 4. remove the protective sheath from one end of a transfer needle and pierce the stopper of the vial containing water for injections. remove the protective sheath from the other end of the transfer needle. invert the solvent vial and pierce the stopper of the vial containing the powder. 5. tilt the product vial when transferring the solvent to allow the solvent to flow down the side of the vial. 6. remove the empty vial and the transfer needle. 7. swirl the vial gently to completely dissolve the powder. do not shake! the powder dissolves within 5 minutes to produce a clear, colourless to light-yellow solution. immediately before administration, the solution should be inspected: the solution should be clear and must be free of lumps. once dissolved, the product should be used immediately (at least within 3 hours). nonafact should never be mixed with other medicinal products. administration 1. using a hypodermic needle and syringe, draw the dissolved product out of the vial. 2. nonafact should be injected into a vein (intravenous administration). 3. inject the dissolved product very gradually (approx. 2 ml per minute). disposal any unused product or waste material must be discarded as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. duration of treatment: haemophilia b is a chronic disease, therefore lifelong treatment with a factor ix product may be necessary. if you use more nonafact than you should: no symptoms of overdose with human coagulation factor ix have been reported.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nonafact", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

products derived from human blood, the use of nonafact can cause allergic reactions which may include swelling of the larynx, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, hives, itching and rash, headache, tiredness, nausea, restlessness, fast heart beat, chest tightness, tingling, vomiting, wheezing. you should discuss the possible side effects with your doctor in order to know how to recognise them and what to do if they occur. where necessary, mild allergic reactions, such as hives, can be treated with antihistamines (medicinal products which counteract allergies). in the case of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), immediately stop the administration of the product and contact your doctor immediately. there is a very slight risk that nonafact will cause clots to form in blood vessels, resulting in thrombosis. the use of nonafact may also produce an increase in body temperature in rare cases. your body may develop antibodies (inhibitors) against factor ix, which will inactivate nonafact. your doctor will check your blood regularly for the presence of these antibodies. contact your doctor immediately if you suspect that the product is becoming progressively less effective. this will show itself as an increased tendency to bleed. if you need therapy for repressing antibodies (inhibitors) this should be taken care of in a haemophilia treating centre. you will be closely monitored for any possible side effect during this treatment. if you should experience one of these side effects, you are advised to contact your doctor. if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nonafact", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":
