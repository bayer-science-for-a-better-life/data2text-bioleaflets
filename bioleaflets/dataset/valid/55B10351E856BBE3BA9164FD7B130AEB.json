CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAybintio in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult \n\npatients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \n\n \nAybintio in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic \n\nbreast cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, \n\nplease refer to section 5.1. \n\n \n\nAybintio in combination with capecitabine is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with \n\nmetastatic breast cancer in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including taxanes or \n\nanthracyclines is not considered appropriate. Patients who have received taxane and \n\nanthracyclinecontaining regimens in the adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should be excluded \n\nfrom treatment with Aybintio in combination with capecitabine. For further information as to HER2 status, \n\nplease refer to section 5.1. \n\n \nAybintio, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients \n\nwith unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology. \n\n \nAybintio, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with \n\nunresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with Epidermal \n\nGrowth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nAybintio in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first line treatment of adult patients with \n\nadvanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer. \n\n \nAybintio, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment of adult \n\npatients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages III B, III C \n\nand IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nAybintio, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and \n\npaclitaxel, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial \n\novarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab \n\nor other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents. \n\n \n\nAybintio, in combination with topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment \n\nof adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal \n\ncancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who have not received prior \n\ntherapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents (see section 5.1). \n\n \nAybintio, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in patients \n\nwho cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, \n\nrecurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nAybintio must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Aybintio, administered as an intravenous infusion, is either 5 mg/kg or \n\n10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given once \n\nevery 3 weeks. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \n\nunacceptable toxicity. \n\n \nMetastatic breast cancer (mBC) \n\n \nThe recommended dose of Aybintio is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg of \n\nbody weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \n\nunacceptable toxicity. \n\n \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n\n \n\nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy \n\n \nAybintio is administered in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles of treatment \n\nfollowed by Aybintio as a single agent until disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Aybintio is 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as \n\nan intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nClinical benefit in NSCLC patients has been demonstrated with both 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg doses (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \n\nunacceptable toxicity. \n \n\nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations in combination with \n\nerlotinib \n\n \nEGFR mutation testing should be performed prior to initiation of treatment with the combination of \n\nAybintio and erlotinib. It is important that a well-validated and robust methodology is chosen to avoid false \n\nnegative or false positive determinations. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Aybintio when used in addition to erlotinib is 15 mg/kg of body weight given \n\nonce every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the treatment with Aybintio in addition to erlotinib is continued until disease \n\nprogression. \n\n \nFor the posology and method of administration of erlotinib, please refer to the full erlotinib prescribing \n\ninformation. \n\n \nAdvanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) \n\n \nThe recommended dose of Aybintio is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks as an \n\nintravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \n\nunacceptable toxicity. \n\n \n\nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer \n\n \n\nFront-line treatment  \n\nAybintio is administered in addition to carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to 6 cycles of treatment followed \n\nby continued use of Aybintio as single agent until disease progression or for a maximum of 15 months or \n\nuntil unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs earlier. The recommended dose of Aybintio is 15 mg/kg of \n\nbody weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n\n \nTreatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent disease  \n\nAybintio is administered in combination with either carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 cycles and up to 10 \n\ncycles or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 cycles and up to 8 cycles, followed by \n\ncontinued use of Aybintio as single agent until disease progression. The recommended dose of Aybintio is \n\n15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nTreatment of platinum-resistant recurrent disease  \n\nAybintio is administered in combination with one of the following agents - topotecan (given weekly) or \n\npegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The recommended dose of Aybintio is 10 mg/kg of body weight given \n\nonce every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion. When Aybintio is administered in combination with \n\ntopotecan (given on days 1-5, every 3 weeks), the recommended dose of Aybintio is 15 mg/kg of body \n\nweight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. It is recommended that treatment be continued \n\nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1, study MO22224). \n\n \nCervical Cancer \n\n \n\nAybintio is administered in combination with one of the following chemotherapy regimens: paclitaxel and \n\ncisplatin or paclitaxel and topotecan. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Aybintio is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \n\nintravenous infusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \n\nunacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\n \nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in the patients \u2265 65 years of age. \n\n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children aged less than 18 years old have not been established. \n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology \n\ncan be made. \n\n \nThere is no relevant use of bevacizumab in the paediatric population in the indications for treatment of \n\ncancers of the colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneum, cervix and kidney. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nAybintio is for intravenous use. The initial dose should be delivered over 90 minutes as an intravenous \n\ninfusion. If the first infusion is well tolerated, the second infusion may be administered over 60 minutes. If \n\nthe 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. \n\n \nIt should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n\n \nDose reduction for adverse reactions is not recommended. If indicated, therapy should either be \n\npermanently discontinued or temporarily suspended as described in section 4.4. \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n\n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Aybintio \n\ninfusions should not be administered or mixed with glucose solutions. This medicinal product must not be \n\nmixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell products or other recombinant human or \n\nhumanised antibodies. \n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n\n \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulae (see section 4.8) \n\nPatients may be at an increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation and gall bladder \n\nperforation when treated with bevacizumab. Intra-abdominal inflammatory process may be a risk factor for \n\ngastrointestinal perforations in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, therefore, caution \n\nshould be exercised when treating these patients. Prior radiation is a risk factor for GI perforation in \n\n\n\n6 \n\npatients treated for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab and all patients \n\nwith GI perforation had a history of prior radiation. Therapy should be permanently discontinued in \n\npatients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. \n\n \nGI-vaginal fistulae in study GOG-0240 \n\nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab are at increased \n\nrisk of fistulae between the vagina and any part of the GI tract (Gastrointestinal-vaginal fistulae). Prior \n\nradiation is a major risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae and all patients with GI-vaginal \n\nfistulae had a history of prior radiation. Recurrence of cancer within the field of prior radiation is an \n\nadditional important risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae. \n\n \n\nNon-GI fistulae (see section 4.8) \n\nPatients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with bevacizumab. \n\nPermanently discontinue Aybintio in patients with tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula or any Grade 4 fistula \n\n[US National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.3)]. \n\nLimited information is available on the continued use of bevacizumab in patients with other fistulae. \n\nIn cases of internal fistula not arising in the gastrointestinal tract, discontinuation of Aybintio should be \n\nconsidered. \n\n \nWound healing complications (see section 4.8) \n\nBevacizumab may adversely affect the wound healing process. Serious wound healing complications, \n\nincluding anastomotic complications, with a fatal outcome have been reported. Therapy should not be \n\ninitiated for at least 28 days following major surgery or until the surgical wound is fully healed. In patients \n\nwho experienced wound healing complications during therapy, treatment should be withheld until the \n\nwound is fully healed. Therapy should be withheld for elective surgery. \n\n \nNecrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, has rarely been reported in patients treated with bevacizumab. \n\nThis condition is usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula \n\nformation. Aybintio therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis, and \n\nappropriate treatment should be promptly initiated. \n\n \nHypertension (see section 4.8) \n\nAn increased incidence of hypertension was observed in bevacizumab-treated patients. Clinical safety data \n\nsuggest that the incidence of hypertension is likely to be dose-dependent. Pre-existing hypertension should \n\nbe adequately controlled before starting Aybintio treatment. There is no information on the effect of \n\nbevacizumab in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of initiating therapy. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of blood pressure is generally recommended during therapy. \n\n \nIn most cases hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment \n\nappropriate for the individual situation of the affected patient. The use of diuretics to manage hypertension \n\nis not advised in patients who receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. Aybintio should be \n\npermanently discontinued if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with \n\nantihypertensive therapy, or if the patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. \n\n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (see section 4.8) \n\nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \n\nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurologic disorder, which can present with the following signs and \n\nsymptoms among others: seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, \n\nwith or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, \n\npreferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In patients developing PRES, treatment of specific \n\nsymptoms including control of hypertension is recommended along with discontinuation of Aybintio. The \n\nsafety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known. \n\n \nProteinuria (see section 4.8) \n\nPatients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of proteinuria when \n\ntreated with bevacizumab. There is evidence suggesting that all Grade (US National Cancer Institute- \n\nCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE v.3]) proteinuria may be related to the \n\n\n\n7 \n\ndose. Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting and during therapy. \n\nGrade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to 1.4% of patients treated with bevacizumab. \n\nTherapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome (NCI-CTCAE \n\nv.3). \n\n \nArterial thromboembolism (see section 4.8) \n\nIn clinical trials, the incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions including cerebrovascular accidents \n\n(CVAs), transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs) was higher in patients \n\nreceiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those who received chemotherapy \n\nalone. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, with a history of arterial thromboembolism, diabetes or \n\nage greater than 65 years have an increased risk of developing arterial thromboembolic reactions during \n\ntherapy. Caution should be taken when treating these patients with Aybintio. \n\n \nTherapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop arterial thromboembolic reactions. \n\n \nVenous thromboembolism (see section 4.8) \n\nPatients may be at risk of developing venous thromboembolic reactions, including pulmonary embolism \n\nunder bevacizumab treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab in combination \n\nwith paclitaxel and cisplatin may be at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. \n\n \n\nAybintio should be discontinued in patients with life-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, \n\nincluding pulmonary embolism (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Patients with thromboembolic reactions \u2264 Grade 3 need \n\nto be closely monitored (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n \nHaemorrhage \n\nPatients treated with bevacizumab have an increased risk of haemorrhage, especially tumour-associated \n\nhaemorrhage. Aybintio should be discontinued permanently in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 \n\nbleeding during bevacizumab therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8). \n\n \nPatients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely excluded from clinical trials with bevacizumab, \n\nbased on imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS haemorrhage in such \n\npatients has not been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials (see section 4.8). Patients should \n\nbe monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and Aybintio treatment discontinued in cases of \n\nintracranial bleeding. \n\n \nThere is no information on the safety profile of bevacizumab in patients with congenital bleeding diathesis, \n\nacquired coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the treatment of \n\nthromboembolism prior to starting bevacizumab treatment, as such patients were excluded from clinical \n\ntrials. Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating therapy in these patients. However, patients \n\nwho developed venous thrombosis while receiving therapy did not appear to have an increased rate of \n\nGrade 3 or above bleeding when treated with a full dose of warfarin and bevacizumab concomitantly \n\n(NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n \nPulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis \n\nPatients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with bevacizumab may be at risk of serious, and in some \n\ncases fatal, pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis. Patients with recent pulmonary haemorrhage/ \n\nhaemoptysis (> 2.5 ml of red blood) should not be treated with bevacizumab. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the formation \n\nof aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Aybintio, this risk should be carefully considered \n\nin patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.8) \n\nReactions consistent with CHF were reported in clinical trials. The findings ranged from asymptomatic \n\ndeclines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or hospitalisation. \n\nCaution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease such \n\nas pre-existing coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure with bevacizumab. \n\n \nMost of the patients who experienced CHF had metastatic breast cancer and had received previous \n\ntreatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF were \n\npresent. \n\n \nIn patients in AVF3694g who received treatment with anthracyclines and who had not received \n\nanthracyclines before, no increased incidence of all Grade CHF was observed in the anthracycline + \n\nbevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF Grade 3 or higher reactions \n\nwere somewhat more frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \n\nthan in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with results in patients in other studies of \n\nmetastatic breast cancer who did not receive concurrent anthracycline treatment (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \nNeutropenia and infections (see section 4.8) \n\nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe neutropenia \n\n(including some fatalities) have been observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic chemotherapy \n\nregimens plus bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone. This has mainly been seen in \n\ncombination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC, mBC, and in \n\ncombination with paclitaxel and topotecan in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.8) \n\nPatients may be at risk of developing infusion/hypersensitivity reactions. Close observation of the patient \n\nduring and following the administration of bevacizumab is recommended as expected for any infusion of a \n\ntherapeutic humanised monoclonal antibody. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be discontinued and \n\nappropriate medical therapies should be administered. A systematic premedication is not warranted. \n\n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (see section 4.8) \n\nCases of ONJ have been reported in cancer patients treated with bevacizumab, the majority of whom had \n\nreceived prior or concomitant treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates, for which ONJ is an identified \n\nrisk. Caution should be exercised when bevacizumab and intravenous bisphosphonates are administered \n\nsimultaneously or sequentially. \n\n \n\nInvasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. A dental examination and appropriate \n\npreventive dentistry should be considered prior to starting the treatment with Aybintio. In patients who \n\nhave previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates invasive dental procedures should \n\nbe avoided, if possible. \n\n \nIntravitreal use \n\nAybintio is not formulated for intravitreal use. \n\n \nEye disorders \n\nIndividual cases and clusters of serious ocular adverse reactions have been reported following unapproved \n\nintravitreal use of bevacizumab compounded from vials approved for intravenous administration in cancer \n\npatients. These reactions included infectious endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation such as sterile \n\nendophthalmitis, uveitis and vitritis, retinal detachment, retinal pigment epithelial tear, intraocular pressure \n\nincreased, intraocular haemorrhage such as vitreous haemorrhage or retinal haemorrhage and conjunctival \n\nhaemorrhage. Some of these reactions have resulted in various degrees of visual loss, including permanent \n\nblindness. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystemic effects following intravitreal use \n\nA reduction of circulating VEGF concentration has been demonstrated following intravitreal anti-VEGF \n\ntherapy. Systemic adverse reactions including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic \n\nreactions have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. \n\n \nOvarian failure/fertility \n\n \n\nBevacizumab may impair female fertility (see sections 4.6 and 4.8). Therefore fertility preservation \n\nstrategies should be discussed with women of child-bearing potential prior to starting treatment with \n\nbevacizumab. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffect of antineoplastic agents on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics \n\nNo clinically relevant interaction of co-administered chemotherapy on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was \n\nobserved based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. There were neither statistically \n\nsignificant nor clinically relevant differences in bevacizumab clearance in patients receiving bevacizumab \n\nmonotherapy compared to patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with interferon alfa-2a, erlotinib \n\nor chemotherapies (IFL, 5-FU/LV, carboplatin/paclitaxel, capecitabine, doxorubicin or \n\ncisplatin/gemcitabine). \n\n \nEffect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n\nNo clinically relevant interaction of bevacizumab was observed on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nco-administered interferon alfa 2a, erlotinib (and its active metabolite OSI-420), or the chemotherapies \n\nirinotecan (and its active metabolite SN38), capecitabine, oxaliplatin (as determined by measurement of \n\nfree and total platinum), and cisplatin. Conclusions on the impact of bevacizumab on gemcitabine \n\npharmacokinetics cannot be drawn. \n\n \nCombination of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate \n\nIn two clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) \n\nwas reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every two weeks) and sunitinib \n\nmalate (50 mg daily) combination. \n\n \nMAHA is a haemolytic disorder which can present with red cell fragmentation, anaemia, and \n\nthrombocytopenia. In addition, hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), elevated creatinine, and \n\nneurological symptoms were observed in some of these patients. All of these findings were reversible upon \n\ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate (see Hypertension, Proteinuria, PRES in section 4.4). \n\n \nCombination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n\nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe neutropenia \n\n(including some fatalities) have been observed mainly in patients treated with platinum- or taxane-based \n\ntherapies in the treatment of NSCLC and mBC. \n\n \nRadiotherapy \n\nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of radiotherapy and bevacizumab has not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \nEGFR monoclonal antibodies in combination with bevacizumab chemotherapy regimens \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. EGFR monoclonal antibodies should not be administered for \n\nthe treatment of mCRC in combination with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. Results from the \n\nrandomised phase III studies, PACCE and CAIRO-2, in patients with mCRC suggest that the use of \n\nanti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab, respectively, in combination with \n\nbevacizumab plus chemotherapy, is associated with decreased PFS and/or OS, and with increased toxicity \n\ncompared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy alone. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during (and up to 6 months after) \n\ntreatment. \n\n \nPregnancy \n\nThere are no clinical trial data on the use of bevacizumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). IgGs are known to cross the \n\nplacenta, and bevacizumab is anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the foetus, and thus is suspected to \n\ncause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. In the post-marketing setting, cases of \n\nfoetal abnormalities in women treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination with known embryotoxic \n\nchemotherapeutics have been observed (see section 4.8). Bevacizumab is contraindicated in pregnancy (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk. As maternal IgG is excreted in milk and \n\nbevacizumab could harm infant growth and development (see section 5.3), women must discontinue \n\nbreast-feeding during therapy and not breast-feed for at least six months following the last dose of \n\nbevacizumab. \n\n \nFertility \n\nRepeat dose toxicity studies in animals have shown that bevacizumab may have an adverse effect on \n\nfemale fertility (see section 5.3). In a phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer, \n\na substudy with premenopausal women has shown a higher incidence of new cases of ovarian failure in the \n\nbevacizumab group compared to the control group. After discontinuation of bevacizumab treatment, \n\novarian function recovered in the majority of patients. Long term effects of the treatment with bevacizumab \n\non fertility are unknown. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nBevacizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \n\nsomnolence and syncope have been reported with bevacizumab use (see table 1 in section 4.8). If patients \n\nare experiencing symptoms that affect their vision or concentration, or their ability to react, they should be \n\nadvised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe overall safety profile of bevacizumab is based on data from over 5,700 patients with various \n\nmalignancies, predominantly treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in clinical trials. \n\n \nThe most serious adverse reactions were: \n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal perforations (see section 4.4). \n\u2022 Haemorrhage, including pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, which is more common in non-small \n\ncell lung cancer patients (see section 4.4). \n\n\u2022 Arterial thromboembolism (see section 4.4). \n\n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving bevacizumab \n\nwere hypertension, fatigue or asthenia, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. \n\n \nAnalyses of the clinical safety data suggest that the occurrence of hypertension and proteinuria with \n\nbevacizumab therapy are likely to be dose-dependent. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions listed in this section fall into the following frequency categories: very common \n\n(\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very \n\nrare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTables 1 and 2 list adverse reactions associated with the use of bevacizumab in combination with different \n\nchemotherapy regimens in multiple indications, by MedDRA system organ class. \n\n \nTable 1 provides all adverse reactions by frequency that were determined to have a causal relationship with \n\nbevacizumab through: \n\n\u2022 comparative incidences noted between clinical trial treatment arms (with at least a 10% difference \ncompared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE Grade 1-5 reactions or at least a 2% difference \n\ncompared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 reactions, \n\n\u2022 post-authorisation safety studies, \n\u2022 spontaneous reporting, \n\u2022 epidemiological studies\\non-interventional or observational studies, \n\u2022 or through an evaluation of individual case reports. \n \n\nTable 2 provides the frequency of severe adverse reactions. Severe reactions are defined as adverse events \n\nwith at least a 2% difference compared to the control arm in clinical studies for NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 \n\nreactions. Table 2 also includes adverse reactions which are considered by the MAH to be clinically \n\nsignificant or severe. \n\n \nPost-marketing adverse reactions are included in both Tables 1 and 2, where applicable. Detailed \n\ninformation about these post-marketing reactions are provided in Table 3. \n\n \nAdverse reactions are added to the appropriate frequency category in the tables below according to the \n\nhighest incidence seen in any indication. \n\nWithin each frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \nSome of the adverse reactions are reactions commonly seen with chemotherapy; however, bevacizumab \n\nmay exacerbate these reactions when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. Examples include \n\npalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or capecitabine, \n\nperipheral sensory neuropathy with paclitaxel or oxaliplatin, nail disorders or alopecia with paclitaxel, and \n\nparonychia with erlotinib. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

From a \n\nclinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-0240), GI \n\nperforations (all grade) were reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had a history of prior pelvic \n\nradiation. \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of those events varied in type and severity, ranging from free air seen on the plain \n\nabdominal X-ray, which resolved without treatment, to intestinal perforation with abdominal abscess and \n\nfatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra-abdominal inflammation was present, either from gastric \n\nulcer disease, tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or chemotherapy-associated colitis. \n\n \nFatal outcome was reported in approximately a third of serious cases of gastrointestinal perforations, which \n\nrepresents between 0.2%-1% of all bevacizumab treated patients. \n\n \nIn bevacizumab clinical trials, gastrointestinal fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an incidence of \n\nup to 2% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were also reported less \n\ncommonly in patients with other types of cancer. \n\n \nGI-vaginal fistulae in study GOG-0240 \n\nIn a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of GI-vaginal \n\nfistulae was 8.3% in bevacizumab-treated patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of whom had a history \n\nof prior pelvic radiation. The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the group treated with \n\nbevacizumab + chemotherapy was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of prior radiation \n\n(16.7%) compared with patients with no prior radiation and/ or no recurrence inside the field of prior \n\nradiation (3.6%). The corresponding frequencies in the control group receiving chemotherapy alone were \n\n1.1% vs. 0.8%, respectively. Patients who develop GI-vaginal fistulae may also have bowel obstructions \n\nand require surgical intervention as well as diverting ostomies. \n\n \nNon-GI fistulae (see section 4.4) \n\nBevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in death. \n\n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (GOG-240), 1.8% of \n\nbevacizumab-treated patients and 1.4% of control patients were reported to have had non-gastrointestinal \n\nvaginal, vesical, or female genital tract fistulae. \n\n \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1% to < 1%) reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the \n\ngastrointestinal tract (e.g. bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were observed across various indications. \n\nFistulae have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \nReactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging from one week to greater than \n\n1 year from initiation of bevacizumab, with most reactions occurring within the first 6 months of therapy. \n\n \nWound healing (see section 4.4) \n\nAs bevacizumab may adversely impact wound healing, patients who had major surgery within the last \n\n28 days were excluded from participation in phase III clinical trials. \n\n \nIn clinical trials of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, there was no increased risk of \n\npost- operative bleeding or wound healing complications observed in patients who underwent major \n\nsurgery 28-60 days prior to starting bevacizumab. An increased incidence of post-operative bleeding or \n\nwound healing complication occurring within 60 days of major surgery was observed if the patient was \n\n\n\n16 \n\nbeing treated with bevacizumab at the time of surgery. The incidence varied between 10% (4/40) and 20% \n\n(3/15). \n\n \nSerious wound healing complications, including anastomotic complications, have been reported, some of \n\nwhich had a fatal outcome. \n\n \nIn locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer trials, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were \n\nobserved in up to 1.1% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared with up to 0.9% of patients in the \n\ncontrol arms (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n \nIn clinical trials of ovarian cancer, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were observed in up to 1.8% of \n\npatients in the bevacizumab arm versus 0.1% in the control arm (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n \n\nHypertension (see section 4.4) \n\nIn clinical trials, with the exception of study JO25567, the overall incidence of hypertension (all grades) \n\nranged up to 42.1% in the bevacizumab containing arms compared with up to 14% in the control arms. The \n\noverall incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 hypertension in patients receiving bevacizumab ranged from \n\n0.4% to 17.9%. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) occurred in up to 1.0% of patients treated with \n\nbevacizumab and chemotherapy compared to up to 0.2% of patients treated with the same chemotherapy \n\nalone. \n\n \nIn study JO25567, all grade hypertension was observed in 77.3% of the patients who received bevacizumab \n\nin combination with erlotinib as first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR activating \n\nmutations, compared to 14.3% of patients treated with erlotinib alone. Grade 3 hypertension was 60.0% in \n\npatients treated with bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared to 11.7% in patients treated with \n\nerlotinib alone. There were no grade 4 or 5 hypertension events. \n\n \nHypertension was generally adequately controlled with oral anti-hypertensives such as \n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and calcium-channel blockers. It rarely resulted in \n\ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment or hospitalisation. \n\n \nVery rare cases of hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported, some of which were fatal. \n\n \nThe risk of bevacizumab-associated hypertension did not correlate with the patients\u2019 baseline \n\ncharacteristics, underlying disease or concomitant therapy. \n\n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (see section 4.4) \n\nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \n\nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurological disorder. Presentation may include seizures, headache, altered \n\nmental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. The \n\nclinical presentation of PRES is often nonspecific, and therefore the diagnosis of PRES requires \n\nconfirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. \n\n \nIn patients developing PRES, early recognition of symptoms with prompt treatment of specific symptoms \n\nincluding control of hypertension (if associated with severe uncontrolled hypertension) is recommended in \n\naddition to discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days \n\nafter treatment discontinuation, although some patients have experienced some neurologic sequelae. The \n\nsafety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known. \n\n \nAcross clinical trials, 8 cases of PRES have been reported. Two of the eight cases did not have radiological \n\nconfirmation via MRI. \n\n \nProteinuria (see section 4.4) \n\nIn clinical trials, proteinuria has been reported within the range of 0.7% to 54.7% of patients receiving \n\nbevacizumab. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nProteinuria ranged in severity from clinically asymptomatic, transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic \n\nsyndrome, with the great majority as Grade 1 proteinuria (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Grade 3 proteinuria was \n\nreported in up to 10.9% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to \n\n1.4% of treated patients. Testing for proteinuria is recommended prior to start of bevacizumab therapy. In \n\nmost clinical trials urine protein levels of \u2265 2g/24 hrs led to the holding of bevacizumab until recovery to \n\n< 2g/24 hrs. \n\n \nHaemorrhage (see section 4.4) \n\nIn clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-5 bleeding \n\nreactions ranged from 0.4% to 6.9% in bevacizumab treated patients, compared with up to 4.5% of patients \n\nin the chemotherapy control group. \n\n \n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-0240), \n\ngrade 3-5 bleeding reactions have been reported in up to 8.3% of patients treated with bevacizumab in \n\ncombination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 4.6% of patients treated with paclitaxel and \n\ntopotecan. \n\n \nThe haemorrhagic reactions that have been observed in clinical trials were predominantly \n\ntumour-associated haemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis). \n\n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage (see section 4.4) \n\nMajor or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis has been observed primarily in trials in patients \n\nwith non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Possible risk factors include squamous cell histology, treatment \n\nwith antirheumatic/anti-inflammatory substances, treatment with anticoagulants, prior radiotherapy, \n\nbevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumour location and cavitation of \n\ntumours prior to or during therapy. The only variables that showed statistically significant correlations with \n\nbleeding were bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell histology. Patients with NSCLC of known \n\nsquamous cell histology or mixed cell type with predominant squamous cell histology were excluded from \n\nsubsequent phase III trials, while patients with unknown tumour histology were included. \n\n \nIn patients with NSCLC excluding predominant squamous histology, all Grade reactions were seen with a \n\nfrequency of up to 9.3% when treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with up to 5% in the \n\npatients treated with chemotherapy alone. Grade 3-5 reactions have been observed in up to 2.3% of patients \n\ntreated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as compared with < 1% with chemotherapy alone \n\n(NCI-CTCAE v.3). Major or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis can occur suddenly and up to \n\ntwo thirds of the serious pulmonary haemorrhages resulted in a fatal outcome. \n\n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melaena have been reported in colorectal \n\ncancer patients, and have been assessed as tumour-associated haemorrhages. \n\n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumour types and locations, including cases \n\nof central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in patients with CNS metastases (see section 4.4). \n\n \nThe incidence of CNS bleeding in patients with untreated CNS metastases receiving bevacizumab has not \n\nbeen prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials. In an exploratory retrospective analysis of data \n\nfrom 13 completed randomised trials in patients with various tumour types, 3 patients out of 91 (3.3%) \n\nwith brain metastases experienced CNS bleeding (all Grade 4) when treated with bevacizumab, compared \n\nto 1 case (Grade 5) out of 96 patients (1%) that were not exposed to bevacizumab. In two subsequent \n\nstudies in patients with treated brain metastases (which included around 800 patients), one case of Grade 2 \n\nCNS haemorrhage was reported in 83 subjects treated with bevacizumab (1.2%) at the time of interim \n\nsafety analysis (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n \n\nAcross all clinical trials, mucocutaneous haemorrhage has been seen in up to 50% of bevacizumab-treated \n\npatients. These were most commonly NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 1 epistaxis that lasted less than 5 minutes, \n\nresolved without medical intervention and did not require any changes in the bevacizumab treatment \n\nregimen. Clinical safety data suggest that the incidence of minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage (e.g. \n\nepistaxis) may be dose-dependent. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThere have also been less common reactions of minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage in other locations, such \n\nas gingival bleeding or vaginal bleeding. \n\n \nThromboembolism (see section 4.4) \n\nArterial thromboembolism: An increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions was observed in \n\npatients treated with bevacizumab across indications, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial \n\ninfarction, transient ischaemic attacks, and other arterial thromboembolic reactions. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, the overall incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions ranged up to 3.8% in the \n\nbevacizumab containing arms compared with up to 2.1% in the chemotherapy control arms. Fatal outcome \n\nwas reported in 0.8% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.5% in patients receiving \n\nchemotherapy alone. Cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischaemic attacks) were reported in up \n\nto 2.7% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to up to 0.5% \n\nof patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Myocardial infarction was reported in up to 1.4% of patients \n\ntreated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to up to 0.7% of patients treated \n\nwith chemotherapy alone. \n\n \nIn one clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, AVF2192g, \n\npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not candidates for treatment with irinotecan were \n\nincluded. In this trial arterial thromboembolic reactions were observed in 11% (11/100) of patients \n\ncompared to 5.8% (6/104) in the chemotherapy control group. \n\n \nVenous thromboembolism: The incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions in clinical trials was similar \n\nin patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those receiving the \n\ncontrol chemotherapy alone. Venous thromboembolic reactions include deep venous thrombosis, \n\npulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. \n\n \nIn clinical trials across indications, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions ranged from \n\n2.8% to 17.3% of bevacizumab-treated patients compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the control arms. \n\n \nGrade 3-5 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) venous thromboembolic reactions have been reported in up to 7.8% of \n\npatients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with up to 4.9% in patients treated with \n\nchemotherapy alone (across indications, excluding persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer). \n\n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-0240), \n\ngrade 3-5 venous thromboembolic events have been reported in up to 15.6% of patients treated with \n\nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared with up to 7.0% of patients treated \n\nwith paclitaxel and cisplatin. \n\n \nPatients who have experienced a venous thromboembolic reaction may be at higher risk for a recurrence if \n\nthey receive bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. \n\n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \n\nIn clinical trials with bevacizumab, congestive heart failure (CHF) was observed in all cancer indications \n\nstudied to date, but occurred predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In four phase III trials \n\n(AVF2119g, E2100, BO17708 and AVF3694g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer CHF Grade 3 \n\n(NCI-CTCAE v.3) or higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with bevacizumab in \n\ncombination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For patients in study \n\nAVF3694g who received anthracyclines concomitantly with bevacizumab, the incidences of Grade 3 or \n\nhigher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar to those in the other studies in \n\nmetastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab arm and 0% in the anthracycline + \n\nplacebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all Grade CHF were similar between the \n\nanthracycline + bevacizumab (6.2%) and the anthracycline + placebo arms (6.0%). \n\n \nMost patients who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left ventricular \n\nfunction following appropriate medical therapy. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nIn most clinical trials of bevacizumab, patients with pre-existing CHF of NYHA (New York Heart \n\nAssociation) II-IV were excluded, therefore, no information is available on the risk of CHF in this \n\npopulation. \n\n \nPrior anthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiation to the chest wall may be possible risk factors for the \n\ndevelopment of CHF. \n\n \n\nAn increased incidence of CHF has been observed in a clinical trial of patients with diffuse large B- cell \n\nlymphoma when receiving bevacizumab with a cumulative doxorubicin dose greater than 300 mg/m2. This \n\nphase III clinical trial compared rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone \n\n(R-CHOP) plus bevacizumab to R- CHOP without bevacizumab. While the incidence of CHF was, in both \n\narms, above that previously observed for doxorubicin therapy, the rate was higher in the R-CHOP plus \n\nbevacizumab arm. These results suggest that close clinical observation with appropriate cardiac \n\nassessments should be considered for patients exposed to cumulative doxorubicin doses greater than 300 \n\nmg/m2 when combined with bevacizumab. \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.4 and Post-marketing experience below) \n\nIn some clinical trials anaphylactic and anaphylactoid-type reactions were reported more frequently in \n\npatients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. The \n\nincidence of these reactions in some clinical trials of bevacizumab is common (up to 5% in \n\nbevacizumab-treated patients). \n\n \nInfections \n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-0240), \n\ngrade 3-5 infections have been reported in up to 24% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination \n\nwith paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 13% of patients treated with paclitaxel and topotecan. \n\n \nOvarian failure/fertility (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\nIn NSABP C-08, a phase III trial of bevacizumab in adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer, the \n\nincidence of new cases of ovarian failure, defined as amenorrhoea lasting 3 or more months, FSH \n\nlevel \u2265 30 mIU/ml and a negative serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test, has been evaluated in 295 premenopausal \n\nwomen. New cases of ovarian failure were reported in 2.6% patients in the mFOLFOX-6 group compared \n\nto 39% in the mFOLFOX-6 + bevacizumab group. After discontinuation of bevacizumab treatment, \n\novarian function recovered in 86.2% of these evaluable women. Long term effects of the treatment with \n\nbevacizumab on fertility are unknown. \n\n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nDecreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood cell count and presence of urine protein may be \n\nassociated with bevacizumab treatment. \n\n \nAcross clinical trials, the following Grade 3 and 4 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) laboratory abnormalities occurred in \n\npatients treated with bevacizumab with at least a 2% difference compared to the corresponding control \n\ngroups: hyperglycaemia, decreased haemoglobin, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, decreased white blood \n\ncell count, increased international normalised ratio (INR). \n\n \nClinical trials have shown that transient increases in serum creatinine (ranging between 1.5-1.9 times \n\nbaseline level), both with and without proteinuria, are associated with the use of bevacizumab. The \n\nobserved increase in serum creatinine was not associated with a higher incidence of clinical manifestations \n\nof renal impairment in patients treated with bevacizumab. \n\n \nOther special populations \n\n \nElderly patients \n\nIn randomised clinical trials, age > 65 years was associated with an increased risk of developing arterial \n\nthromboembolic reactions, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) \n\nand myocardial infarctions (MIs). Other reactions with a higher frequency seen in patients over 65 were \n\n\n\n20 \n\nGrade 3-4 leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (NCI-CTCAE v.3); and all Grade neutropenia, diarrhoea, \n\nnausea, headache and fatigue as compared to those aged \u2264 65 years when treated with bevacizumab (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8 under Thromboembolism). In one clinical trial, the incidence of hypertension of grade \n\n\u2265 3 was two fold higher in patients aged > 65 years than in the younger age group (<65 years). In a study \n\nof platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients, alopecia, mucosal inflammation, peripheral sensory \n\nneuropathy, proteinuria and hypertension were also reported and occurred at a rate at least 5% higher in the \n\nCT + BV arm for bevacizumab-treated patients \u2265 65 years of age compared with bevacizumab-treated \n\npatients aged < 65 years. \n\nNo increase in the incidence of other reactions, including gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing \n\ncomplications, congestive heart failure, and haemorrhage was observed in elderly patients (> 65 years) \n\nreceiving bevacizumab as compared to those aged \u2264 65 years treated with bevacizumab. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children less than 18 years old have not been established. \n\n \nIn study BO25041 of bevacizumab added to postoperative radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant and \n\nadjuvant temozolomide in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial, infratentorial, \n\ncerebellar, or peduncular high-grade glioma, the safety profile was comparable with that observed in other \n\ntumour types in adults treated with bevacizumab. \n\n \nIn study BO20924 of bevacizumab with current standard of care in rhabdomyosarcoma and \n\nnon-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, the safety profile of bevacizumab-treated children was \n\ncomparable with that observed in adults treated with bevacizumab. \n\n \nBevacizumab is not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years. In published literature reports, \n\ncases of non-mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of 18 years treated \n\nwith bevacizumab. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \nTable 3.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, other \n\nantineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C07 \n\n \n\nAybintio is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \nMechanism of action \n\nBevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis and \n\nangiogenesis, and thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR \n\n(VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF regresses the \n\nvascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the formation of new \n\ntumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. \n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAdministration of bevacizumab or its parental murine antibody to xenotransplant models of cancer in nude \n\nmice resulted in extensive anti-tumour activity in human cancers, including colon, breast, pancreas and \n\nprostate. Metastatic disease progression was inhibited and microvascular permeability was reduced. \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of the recommended dose (5 mg/kg of body weight every two weeks) in metastatic \n\ncarcinoma of the colon or rectum were studied in three randomised, active-controlled clinical trials in \n\ncombination with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy. Bevacizumab was combined with two \n\nchemotherapy regimens: \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n22 \n\n\u2022 AVF2107g: A weekly schedule of irinotecan/bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (IFL) for a total of \n4 weeks of each 6 week-cycle (Saltz regimen). \n\n\u2022 AVF0780g: In combination with bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) for a total of 6 weeks \nof each 8 week-cycle (Roswell Park regimen). \n\n\u2022 AVF2192g: In combination with bolus 5-FU/FA for a total of 6 weeks of each 8 week-cycle \n(Roswell Park regimen) in patients who were not optimal candidates for first-line irinotecan \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nThree additional studies with bevacizumab have been conducted in mCRC patients: first-line (NO16966), \n\nsecond-line with no previous bevacizumab treatment (E3200), and second-line with previous bevacizumab \n\ntreatment following disease progression in first-line (ML18147). In these studies, bevacizumab was \n\nadministered at the following dosing regimens in combination with FOLFOX-4 (5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin), \n\nXELOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin), and fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin: \n\n \n\n\u2022 NO16966: Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks in combination with oral \ncapecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin (XELOX) or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in \n\ncombination with leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with \n\nintravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4). \n\n\u2022 E3200: Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks in combination with leucovorin and \n5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with intravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) \n\nin bevacizumab-na\u00efve patients. \n\n\u2022 ML18147: Bevacizumab 5.0 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks or bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg of \nbody weight every 3 weeks in combination with fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan or \n\nfluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin in patients with disease progression following first-line treatment with \n\nbevacizumab. Use of irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-containing regimen was switched depending on \n\nfirst-line usage of either oxaliplatin or irinotecan. \n\n \nAVF2107g \n\nThis was a phase III randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in \n\ncombination with IFL as first-line treatment for metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \n\nEight hundred and thirteen patients were randomised to receive IFL + placebo (Arm 1) or \n\nIFL + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, Arm 2). A third group of 110 patients received bolus \n\n5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (Arm 3). Enrolment in Arm 3 was discontinued, as pre-specified, once safety of \n\nbevacizumab with the IFL regimen was established and considered acceptable. All treatments were \n\ncontinued until disease progression. The overall mean age was 59.4 years; 56.6% of patients had an ECOG \n\nperformance status of 0, 43% had a value of 1 and 0.4% had a value of 2. 15.5% had received prior \n\nradiotherapy and 28.4% prior chemotherapy. \n\n \nThe primary efficacy variable of the trial was overall survival. The addition of bevacizumab to IFL resulted \n\nin statistically significant increases in overall survival, progression-free survival and overall response rate \n\n(see Table 4). The clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival, was seen in all pre-specified patient \n\nsubgroups, including those defined by age, sex, performance status, location of primary tumour, number of \n\norgans involved and duration of metastatic disease. \n \n\nThe efficacy results of bevacizumab in combination with IFL-chemotherapy are displayed in Table 4. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 4 .

One hundred and five \n\npatients were randomised to 5-FU/FA + placebo arm and 104 patients to 5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg \n\nevery 2 weeks) arm. All treatments were continued until disease progression. The addition of bevacizumab \n\n5 mg/kg every two weeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective response rates, significantly longer \n\nprogression-free survival, and a trend in longer survival as compared to 5-FU/FA chemotherapy alone. \n\n \nAVF0780g \n\nThis was a phase II randomised, active-controlled, open-labelled clinical trial investigating bevacizumab in \n\ncombination with 5-FU/FA as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The median age was 64 \n\nyears. 19% of the patients had received prior chemotherapy and 14% prior radiotherapy. \n\nSeventy-one patients were randomised to receive bolus 5-FU/FA or 5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg \n\nevery 2 weeks). A third group of 33 patients received bolus 5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every \n\n2 weeks). Patients were treated until disease progression. The primary endpoints of the trial were objective \n\nresponse rate and progression-free survival. The addition of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every two weeks to \n\n5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective response rates, longer progression-free survival, and a trend in longer \n\nsurvival, compared with 5-FU/FA chemotherapy alone (see Table 5). These efficacy data are consistent \n\nwith the results from trial AVF2107g. \n\n \nThe efficacy data from trials AVF0780g and AVF2192g investigating bevacizumab in combination with \n\n5-FU/FA-chemotherapy are summarised in Table 5. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nTable 5.

Both co-primary objectives were met: \n\n \n\u25cf Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in \n\nthe overall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival \n\nin the eligible per-protocol population. \n\n \n\u25cf Superiority of the bevacizumab-containing arms versus the chemotherapy alone arms in the overall \n\ncomparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival in the ITT population (Table 7). \n\n \nSecondary PFS analyses, based on \u2018on-treatment\u2019-based response assessments, confirmed the significantly \n\nsuperior clinical benefit for patients treated with bevacizumab (analyses shown in Table 7), consistent with \n\nthe statistically significant benefit observed in the pooled analysis. \n\n\n\n26 \n\nTable 7.

Patients were \n\nrandomised to paclitaxel alone (90 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour once weekly for three out of four weeks) or in \n\ncombination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV infusion every two weeks). Prior hormonal therapy for the \n\ntreatment of metastatic disease was allowed. Adjuvant taxane therapy was allowed only if it was completed \n\nat least 12 months prior to trial entry. Of the 722 patients in the trial, the majority of patients had \n\nHER2-negative disease (90%), with a small number of patients with unknown (8%) or confirmed \n\nHER2-positive status (2%), who had previously been treated with or were considered unsuitable for \n\ntrastuzumab therapy. Furthermore, 65% of patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy including 19% \n\nprior taxanes and 49% prior anthracyclines. Patients with central nervous system metastases, including \n\npreviously treated or resected brain lesions, were excluded. \n\n \nIn trial E2100, patients were treated until disease progression. In situations where early discontinuation of \n\nchemotherapy was required, treatment with bevacizumab as a single agent continued until disease \n\nprogression. The patient characteristics were similar across the trial arms. The primary endpoint of this trial \n\nwas progression free survival (PFS), based on trial investigators\u2019 assessment of disease progression. In \n\naddition, an independent review of the primary endpoint was also conducted. The results of this trial are \n\npresented in Table 10. \n\n \nTable 10.

The choices of chemotherapy \n\nincluded capecitabine, taxane (protein-bound paclitaxel, docetaxel), and anthracycline-based agents \n\n(doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/ doxorubicin/ \n\ncyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide) given every three weeks (q3w). \n\nbevacizumab or placebo was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w. \n\n \nThis study included a blinded treatment phase, an optional open-label post-progression phase, and a \n\nsurvival follow-up phase. During the blinded treatment phase, patients received chemotherapy and \n\nmedicinal product (bevacizumab or placebo) every 3 weeks until disease progression, treatment-limiting \n\ntoxicity, or death. On documented disease progression, patients who entered the optional open-label phase \n\ncould receive open-label bevacizumab together with a wide-range of second line therapies. \n\n \nStatistical analyses were performed independently for 1) patients who received capecitabine in combination \n\nwith bevacizumab or placebo; 2) patients who received taxane-based or anthracycline-based chemotherapy \n\nin combination with bevacizumab or placebo.

The 649 randomised patients (641 treated) had Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of \u2265 70%, \n\nno CNS metastases and adequate organ function. Patients were nephrectomised for primary renal cell \n\ncarcinoma. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was given every 2 weeks until disease progression. IFN alfa-2a was \n\ngiven up to 52 weeks or until disease progression at a recommended starting dose of 9 MIU three times a \n\nweek, allowing a dose reduction to 3 MIU three times a week in 2 steps. Patients were stratified according \n\nto country and Motzer score and the treatment arms were shown to be well balanced for the prognostic \n\nfactors. \n\n \nThe primary endpoint was overall survival, with secondary endpoints for the trial including \n\nprogression-free survival. The addition of bevacizumab to IFN-alpha-2a significantly increased PFS and \n\nobjective tumour response rate. These results have been confirmed through an independent radiological \n\nreview. However, the increase in the primary endpoint of overall survival by 2 months was not significant \n\n(HR= 0.91). A high proportion of patients (approximately 63% IFN/placebo; 55% bevacizumab/IFN) \n\nreceived a variety of non-specified post-trial anti-cancer therapies, including antineoplastic agents, which \n\nmay have impacted the analysis of overall survival. \n\n\n\n35 \n\nThe efficacy results are presented in Table 15. \n\n \nTable 15.

Adjustment for these baseline factors resulted in a \n\ntreatment hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI [0.63; 0.96], p=0.0219), indicating a 22% reduction in the risk of \n\ndeath for patients in the bevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a arm compared to IFN alfa-2a arm. \n\n \nNinety seven (97) patients in the IFN alfa-2a arm and 131 patients in the bevacizumab arm reduced the \n\ndose of IFN alfa-2a from 9 MIU to either 6 or 3 MIU three times a week as pre-specified in the protocol. \n\nDose-reduction of IFN alfa-2a did not appear to affect the efficacy of the combination of bevacizumab and \n\nIFN alfa-2a based on PFS event free rates over time, as shown by a sub-group analysis. The 131 patients in \n\nthe bevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a arm who reduced and maintained the IFN alfa-2a dose at 6 or 3 MIU during \n\nthe trial, exhibited at 6, 12 and 18 months PFS event free rates of 73, 52 and 21% respectively, as \n\ncompared to 61, 43 and 17% in the total population of patients receiving bevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a. \n\n \nAVF2938 \n\nThis was a randomised, double-blind, phase II clinical trial investigating bevacizumab 10 mg/kg in a \n\n2 weekly schedule with the same dose of bevacizumab in combination with 150 mg daily erlotinib, in \n\npatients with metastatic clear cell RCC. A total of 104 patients were randomised to treatment in this trial, \n\n53 to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus placebo and 51 to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks \n\nplus erlotinib 150 mg daily. The analysis of the primary endpoint showed no difference between the \n\nbevacizumab + Placebo arm and the bevacizumab + Erlotinib arm (median PFS 8.5 versus 9.9 months). \n\nSeven patients in each arm had an objective response. The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab did not \n\nresult in an improvement in OS (HR = 1.764; p=0.1789), duration of objective response (6.7 vs 9.1 \n\nmonths) or time to symptom progression (HR = 1.172; p=0.5076). \n\n\n\n36 \n\nAVF0890 \n\nThis was a randomised phase II trial conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab versus \n\nplacebo. A total of 116 patients were randomised to receive bevacizumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=39), \n\n10 mg/kg every 2 weeks; (n=37), or placebo (n=40). An interim analysis showed there was a significant \n\nprolongation of the time to progression of disease in the 10 mg/kg group as compared with the placebo \n\ngroup (hazard ratio, 2.55; p < 0.001). There was a small difference, of borderline significance, between the \n\ntime to progression of disease in the 3 mg/kg group and that in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.26; \n\np=0.053). Four patients had objective (partial) response, and all of these had received the 10 mg/kg dose \n\nbevacizumab; the ORR for the 10 mg/kg dose was 10%. \n\n \nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer \n\n \nFront-line treatment of ovarian cancer \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in the front-line treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian, \n\nfallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer were studied in two phase III trials (GOG-0218 and BO17707) \n\nthat evaluated the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to the \n\nchemotherapy regimen alone. \n\n \nGOG-0218 \n\nThe GOG-0218 study was a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm \n\nstudy evaluating the effect of adding bevacizumab to an approved chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and \n\npaclitaxel) in patients with advanced ( Stages IIIB, IIIC and IV according to FIGO staging version dated \n\n1988) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. \n\n \nPatients who had received prior therapy with bevacizumab or prior systemic anticancer therapy for ovarian \n\ncancer (e.g. chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, or hormonal \n\ntherapy) or previous radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis were excluded from the study. \n\n \nA total of 1873 patients were randomised in equal proportions to the following three arms: \n\n \n\u2022 CPP arm: Five cycles of placebo (started cycle 2) in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6) and \n\npaclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a total of up to 15 months of therapy \n\n\u2022 CPB15 arm: Five cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination with \n\ncarboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a total of \n\nup to 15 months of therapy \n\n\u2022 CPB15+ arm: Five cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination with \n\ncarboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by continued use of \n\nbevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w) as single agent for a total of up to 15 months of therapy. \n\n \nThe majority of patients included in the study were White (87% in all three arms); the median age was  \n\n60 years in CPP and CPB15 arms and 59 years in CPB15+ arm; and 29% of patients in CPP or CPB15 and \n\n26% in CPB15+ were over 65 years of age. Overall approximately 50% of patients had a GOG PS of 0 at \n\nbaseline, 43% a GOG PS score of 1, and 7% a GOG PS score of 2. Most patients had EOC (82% in CPP \n\nand CPB15, 85% in CPB15+) followed by PPC (16% in CPP, 15% in CPB15, 13% in CPB15+) and FTC \n\n(1% in CPP, 3% in CPB15, 2% in CPB15+). The majority of patients had serous adenocarcinoma \n\nhistologic type (85% in CPP and CPB15, 86% in CPB15+). Overall approximately 34% of patients were \n\nFIGO Stage III optimally debulked with gross residual disease, 40% Stage III sub-optimally debulked, and \n\n26% were Stage IV patients. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS based on investigator\u2019s assessment of disease progression based on \n\nradiological scans or CA 125 levels, or symptomatic deterioration per protocol. In addition, a prespecified \n\nanalysis of the data censoring for CA-125 progression events was conducted, as well as an independent \n\nreview of PFS as determined by radiological scans. \n\n \n\nThe trial met its primary objective of PFS improvement. Compared to patients treated with chemotherapy \n\n(carboplatin and paclitaxel) alone in the front-line setting, patients who received bevacizumab at a dose of \n\n\n\n37 \n\n15 mg/kg q3w in combination with chemotherapy and continued to receive bevacizumab alone (CPB15+), \n\nhad a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS. \n\n \n\nIn patients who only received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and did not continue to \n\nreceive bevacizumab alone (CPB15), no clinically meaningful benefit in PFS was observed. \n\n \n\nThe results of this study are summarised in Table 16. \n\n \n\nTable 16.

The study evaluated the effect of \n\nadding bevacizumab to carboplatin+paclitaxel and continuing bevacizumab as a single agent until \n\ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity compared to carboplatin+paclitaxel alone. \n\n \nA total of 673 patients were randomized in equal proportions to the following two treatment arms: \n\n\u2022 CP arm: Carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 IV) every 3 weeks for 6 and up to  \n8 cycles. \n\n\u2022 CPB arm: Carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 IV) and concurrent bevacizumab  \n(15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for 6 and up to 8 cycles, followed by bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every  \n\n3 weeks) alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n\n \nMost patients in both the CP arm (80.4%) and the CPB arm (78.9%) were White. The median age was \n\n60.0 years in the CP arm and 59.0 years in the CPB arm. The majority of patients (CP: 64.6%;  \n\nCPB: 68.8%) were in the age category < 65 years. At baseline, most patients in both treatment arms \n\nhad a GOG PS of 0 (CP: 82.4%: CPB; 80.7%) or 1 (CP: 16.7%: CPB; 18.1%). A GOG PS of 2 at \n\nbaseline was reported in 0.9% of patients in the CP arm and in 1.2% of patients in the CPB arm. \n\n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS).

Treatment with bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg \n\nevery 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for 6 and up to 8 cycles, \n\nfollowed by bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity resulted, when data were \n\nderived from eCRF, in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in OS \n\ncompared to treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. \n\n \nMO22224 \n\nStudy MO22224 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \n\nfor platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. This \n\nstudy was designed as an open-label, randomized, two-arm Phase III evaluation of bevacizumab plus \n\nchemotherapy (CT+BV) versus chemotherapy alone (CT). \n\n \n\nA total of 361 patients were enrolled into this study and administered either chemotherapy (paclitaxel, \n\ntopotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) alone or in combination with bevacizumab: \n\n \n\u2022 CT Arm (chemotherapy alone): \n\n\u2022 Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2\n \nas a 1-hour IV infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 4 weeks. \n\n\u2022 Topotecan 4 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. \n\nAlternatively, a 1.25 mg/m2 dose could be administered over 30 minutes on Days 1\u20135 every \n\n3 weeks. \n\n\u2022 PLD 40 mg/m2\n \nas a 1 mg/min IV infusion on Day 1 only every 4 weeks. After Cycle 1, the \n\ndrug could be delivered as a 1-hour infusion. \n\n\u2022 CT+BV Arm (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab): \n\u2022 The chosen chemotherapy was combined with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (or \n\nbevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks if used in combination with topotecan 1.25 mg/m2 on \n\nDays 1\u20135 every 3 weeks). \n\n\n\n44 \n\nEligible patients had epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that progressed \n\nwithin < 6 months of previous platinum therapy consisting of a minimum of 4 platinum therapy cycles. \n\nPatients should have had a life expectancy of \u2265 12 weeks and no prior radiotherapy to the pelvis or \n\nabdomen. Most patients were FIGO Stage IIIC or Stage IV. The majority of patients in both arms had \n\nan ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 (CT: 56.4% vs. CT + BV: 61.2%). The percentage of patients \n\nwith an ECOG PS of 1 or \u2265 2 was 38.7% and 5.0% in the CT arm, and 29.8% and 9.0% in the CT + \n\nBV arm. Information on race exists for 29.3% of patients and nearly all patients were white. The \n\nmedian age of patients was 61.0 (range: 25\u221284) years. A total of 16 patients (4.4%) were > 75 years \n\nold. The overall rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 8.8% in the CT arm and 43.6% in \n\nthe CT + BV arm (mostly due to Grade 2-3 adverse events) and the median time to discontinuation in \n\nthe CT + BV arm was 5.2 months compared with 2.4 months in the CT arm. The rates of \n\ndiscontinuation due to adverse events in the subgroup of patients > 65 years old were 8.8% in the CT \n\narm and 50.0% in the CT + BV arm. The HR for PFS was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.62) and 0.45 (95% \n\nCI: 0.31, 0.67) for the < 65 and \u2265 65 subgroups, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints including objective \n\nresponse rate and overall survival.

There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of \n\nbevacizumab in children with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma. \n\n \nIn a single-arm study (PBTC-022), 18 children with recurrent or progressive non-pontine high-grade \n\nglioma (including 8 with glioblastoma [WHO Grade IV], 9 with anaplastic astrocytoma [Grade III] and \n\n1 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma [Grade III]) were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) two weeks \n\napart and then with bevacizumab in combination with CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m\u00b2) once every two weeks \n\nuntil progression. There were no objective (partial or complete) radiological responses (MacDonald \n\ncriteria). Toxicity and adverse reactions included arterial hypertension and fatigue as well as CNS \n\nischaemia with acute neurological deficit. \n\n \nIn a retrospective single institution series, 12 consecutive (2005 to 2008) children with relapsed or \n\nprogressive high-grade glioma (3 with WHO Grade IV, 9 with Grade III) were treated with \n\nbevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/m\u00b2) every 2 weeks. There were no complete responses \n\nand 2 partial responses (MacDonald criteria). \n\n \nIn a randomized phase II study (BO25041) a total of 121 patients aged \u2265 3 years to <18 years with \n\nnewly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) \n\n\n\n48 \n\nwere treated with post operative radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant temozolomide (T) with and \n\nwithout bevacizumab: 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks IV. \n\n \n\nThe study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant improvement of EFS \n\n(Central Radiology Review Committee (CRRC)-assessed) when bevacizumab was added to the RT/T \n\narm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results were consistent with \n\nthose from various sensitivity analyses and in clinically relevant subgroups. The results for all \n\nsecondary endpoints (investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in showing no \n\nimprovement associated with the addition of bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with the RT/T \n\narm alone. \n\n \nAddition of bevacizumab to RT/T did not demonstrate clinical benefit in study BO25041 in  \n\n60 evaluable children patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or \n\npeduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \nSoft tissue sarcoma \n\nIn a randomized phase II study (BO20924) a total of 154 patients aged \u2265 6 months to <18 years with \n\nnewly diagnosed metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma were \n\ntreated with standard of care (Induction IVADO/IVA+/- local therapy followed by Maintenance \n\nVinorelbine and cyclophosphamide) with or without bevacizumab (2.5 mg/kg/week) for a total \n\nduration of treatment of approximately 18 months. At the time of the final primary analysis, the \n\nprimary endpoint of EFS by independent central review did not show a statistically significant \n\ndifference between the two treatment arms, with HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72). \n\nThe difference in ORR per independent central review was 18% (CI: 0.6%, 35.3%) between the two \n\ntreatment arms in the few patients who had evaluable tumor at baseline and had a confirmed response \n\nprior to receiving any local therapy: 27/75 patients (36.0%, 95% CI: 25.2%, 47.9%) in the Chemo arm \n\nand 34/63 patients (54.0%, 95% CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the Bv + Chemo arm.

Until mature OS results and safety data are available no \n\ndefinitive conclusion can be drawn on the benefit/risk balance. \n\n \nAddition of bevacizumab to standard of care did not demonstrate clinical benefit in clinical trial \n\nBO20924, in 71 evaluable children (from age 6 months to less than 18 years old) patients with \n\nmetastatic Rhabdomyosarcoma and non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \nThe incidence of AEs, including Grade \u2265 3 AEs and SAEs, was similar between the two treatment \n\narms. No AEs leading to death occurred in either treatment arm; all deaths were attributed to disease \n\nprogression. Bevacizumab addition to multimodal standard of care treatment seemed to be tolerated in \n\nthis paediatric population. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic data for bevacizumab are available from ten clinical trials in patients with solid \n\ntumours. In all clinical trials, bevacizumab was administered as an IV infusion. The rate of infusion \n\nwas based on tolerability, with an initial infusion duration of 90 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of \n\nbevacizumab was linear at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg. \n\n \nDistribution \n\nThe typical value for central volume (Vc) was 2.73 L and 3.28 L for female and male patients \n\nrespectively, which is in the range that has been described for IgGs and other monoclonal antibodies. \n\nThe typical value for peripheral volume (Vp) was 1.69 L and 2.35 L for female and male patients \n\nrespectively, when bevacizumab is co-administered with anti-neoplastic agents. After correcting for \n\nbody weight, male patients had a larger Vc (+ 20%) than female patients. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nAssessment of bevacizumab metabolism in rabbits following a single IV dose of 125I-bevacizumab \n\nindicated that its metabolic profile was similar to that expected for a native IgG molecule which does \n\nnot bind VEGF. The metabolism and elimination of bevacizumab is similar to endogenous IgG i.e. \n\nprimarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body, including endothelial cells, and does not rely \n\nprimarily on elimination through the kidneys and liver. Binding of the IgG to the FcRn receptor results \n\nin protection from cellular metabolism and the long terminal half-life. \n\n \nElimination \n\nThe value for clearance is, on average, equal to 0.188 and 0.220 L/day for female and male patients, \n\nrespectively. After correcting for body weight, male patients had a higher bevacizumab clearance  \n\n(+ 17%) than females. According to the two-compartmental model, the elimination half-life is 18 days \n\nfor a typical female patient and 20 days for a typical male patient. \n\n \nLow albumin and high tumour burden are generally indicative of disease severity. Bevacizumab \n\nclearance was approximately 30% faster in patients with low levels of serum albumin and 7% faster in \n\nsubjects with higher tumour burden when compared with a typical patient with median values of \n\nalbumin and tumour burden. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n\nThe population pharmacokinetics were analysed in adult and pediatric patients to evaluate the effects \n\nof demographic characteristics. In adults, the results showed no significant difference in the \n\npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in relation to age. \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in renally impaired \n\npatients since the kidneys are not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n\nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment since the liver is not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab were evaluated in 152 children, adolescents and young adults \n\n(7 months to 21 years, 5.9 to 125 kg) across 4 clinical studies using a population pharmacokinetic \n\nmodel. The pharmacokinetic results show that the clearance and volume of distribution of \n\nbevacizumab were comparable between paediatric and young adult patients when normalised by body \n\nweight, with exposure trending lower as body weight decreased. Age was not associated with the \n\npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab when body weight was taken into account. \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was well characterized by the paediatric population PK model \n\nfor 70 patients in Study BO20924 (1.4 to 17.6 years; 11.6 to 77.5 kg) and 59 patients in Study \n\nBO25041 (1 to 17 years; 11.2 to 82.3 kg). In Study BO20924, bevacizumab exposure was generally \n\nlower compared to a typical adult patient at the same dose. In Study BO25041, bevacizumab exposure \n\nwas similar compared to a typical adult at the same dose. In both studies, bevacizumab exposure \n\ntrended lower as body weight decreased. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn studies of up to 26 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, physeal dysplasia was observed in \n\nyoung animals with open growth plates, at bevacizumab average serum concentrations below the \n\nexpected human therapeutic average serum concentrations. In rabbits, bevacizumab was shown to \n\ninhibit wound healing at doses below the proposed clinical dose. Effects on wound healing were \n\nshown to be fully reversible. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of bevacizumab have not been \n\nperformed. \n\nNo specific studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the effect on fertility. An adverse effect \n\non female fertility can however be expected as repeat dose toxicity studies in animals have shown \n\ninhibition of the maturation of ovarian follicles and a decrease/absence of corpora lutea and associated \n\ndecrease in ovarian and uterus weight as well as a decrease in the number of menstrual cycles. \n\n \n\nBevacizumab has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rabbits. \n\nObserved effects included decreases in maternal and foetal body weights, an increased number of \n\nfoetal resorptions and an increased incidence of specific gross and skeletal foetal malformations. \n\nAdverse foetal outcomes were observed at all tested doses, of which the lowest dose resulted in \n\naverage serum concentrations approximately 3 times larger than in humans receiving 5 mg/kg every  \n\n2 weeks. Information on foetal malformations observed in the post marketing setting are provided in \n\nsection 4.6 Fertiliy, Pregnancy and Lactation and 4.8 Undesirable Effects. \n\n \n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n63 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nAybintio 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\nbevacizumab \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Aybintio is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Aybintio  \n\n3. How to use Aybintio \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Aybintio  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Aybintio is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nAybintio contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a \n\ntype of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection \n\nand cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth \n\nfactor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF \n\nprotein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with \n\nnutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking \n\nthe growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. \n\n \n\nAybintio is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large \n\nbowel, i.e., in the colon or rectum. Aybintio will be administered in combination with chemotherapy \n\ntreatment containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. \n\n \n\nAybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for \n\npatients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called \n\npaclitaxel or capecitabine. \n\n \n\nAybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. \n\nAybintio will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. \n\n \n\nAybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer \n\nwhen cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor \n\n(EGFR). \n\nAybintio will be administered in combination with erlotinib. \n\n \n\nAybintio is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for \n\npatients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nAybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian \n\ntube, or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or \n\nprimary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n\nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \n\nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated \n\nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Aybintio will be administered in \n\ncombination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n\n \n\nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \n\nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated \n\nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Aybintio will be administered in \n\ncombination with topotecan or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. \n\n \n\nAybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical \n\ncancer. Aybintio will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, \n\npaclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Aybintio \n\n \n\nDo not use Aybintio if \n\n- you are allergic (hypersensitive) to bevacizumab or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell products or to other \n\nrecombinant human or humanised antibodies. \n\n- you are pregnant. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aybintio: \n\n \n\n\u25cf It is possible that Aybintio may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you \nhave conditions causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach \n\nulcers, colitis associated with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u25cf Aybintio may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway \nbetween two organs or vessels.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what aybintio is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "aybintio contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection and cancer). bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. the vegf protein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with nutrients and oxygen. once bevacizumab is bound to vegf, tumour growth is prevented by blocking the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. aybintio is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, i.e., in the colon or rectum. aybintio will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. when used for patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called paclitaxel or capecitabine. aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. aybintio will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr). aybintio will be administered in combination with erlotinib. aybintio is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. when used for patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. when used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. when used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, aybintio will be administered in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. when used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, aybintio will be administered in combination with topotecan or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. aybintio will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "aybintio", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "aybintio", "Type": "TREATMENT",

be treated. the recommended dose is 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg per kilogram of your body weight. your doctor will prescribe a dose of aybintio that is right for you. you will be treated with aybintio once every 2 or 3 weeks. the number of infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to treatment; you should continue to receive this medicine until aybintio fails to stop your tumour growing. your doctor will discuss this with you. method and route of administration aybintio is a concentrate for solution for infusion. depending on the dose prescribed for you, some or all of the contents of the aybintio vial will be diluted with sodium chloride solution before use. a doctor or nurse will give you this diluted aybintio solution by intravenous infusion (a drip into your vein). the first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. if this is well-tolerated the second infusion may be given over 60 minutes. later infusions may be given to you over 30 minutes. the administration of aybintio should be temporarily discontinued if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines, if you have problems with wound healing following surgery, if you undergo surgery. the administration of aybintio should be permanently discontinued if you develop severe high blood pressure which cannot be controlled by blood pressure medicines; or a sudden severe rise in blood pressure, presence of protein in your urine accompanied by swelling of your body, a hole in your gut wall, an abnormal tube-like connection or passage between the windpipe and the gullet, between internal organs and skin, between the vagina and any parts of the gut or between other tissues that are not normally connected (fistula), and are judged by your doctor to be severe, serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin, a blood clot in your arteries, a blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs, any severe bleeding. if too much aybintio is given you may develop a severe migraine. if this happens you should talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. if a dose of aybintio is missed your doctor will decide when you should be given your next dose of aybintio. you should discuss this with your doctor. if you stop treatment with aybintio stopping your treatment with aybintio may stop the effect on tumour growth. do not stop treatment with aybintio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.",

your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. the side effects listed below were seen when aybintio was given together with chemotherapy. this does not necessarily mean that these side effects were strictly caused by aybintio. allergic reactions if you have an allergic reaction, tell your doctor or a member of the medical staff straight

blood pressure, feeling of numbness or tingling in hands or feet, decreased number of cells in the blood, including white cells that help to fight against infections (this may be accompanied by fever), and cells that help the blood to clot, feeling weak and having no energy, tiredness, 68 diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. severe side effects, which may be common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100), include: perforation of the gut, bleeding, including bleeding in the lungs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, blocking of the arteries by a blood clot, blocking of the veins by a blood clot, blocking of the blood vessels of the lungs by a blood clot, blocking of the veins of the legs by a blood clot, heart failure, problems with wound healing after surgery, redness,

frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data), include: serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing, allergic reactions (the signs may include difficulty breathing, facial redness, rash, low blood pressure or high blood pressure, low oxygen in your blood, chest pain, or nausea/vomiting), a negative effect on a woman's ability to have children (see the paragraphs below the list of side effects for further recommendations), a brain condition with symptoms including seizures (fits), headache, confusion, and changes in vision (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or pres), symptoms that suggest changes in normal brain function (headaches, vision changes, confusion, or seizures), and high blood pressure, an enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall or a tear in a blood vessel wall (aneurysms and artery dissections), clogging of a very small blood vessel(s) in the kidney, abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs which makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal, a hole in the cartilage wall separating

reduction in the number of white cells in the blood, and cells that help the blood clot, diarrhoea, sickness, headache, fatigue, high blood pressure. aybintio may also cause changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor. these include a decreased number of white cells in the blood, in particular neutrophils (one type of white blood cell which helps protect against infections) in the blood; presence of protein in the urine; decreased blood potassium, sodium or phosphorous (a mineral); increased blood sugar; increased blood alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme); increased serum creatinine (a protein measured by a blood test to see how well your kidneys are working); decreased haemoglobin (found in red blood cells, which carry oxygen), which may be severe. pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. these could be signs and symptoms of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any of them. pre-menopausal women (women who have a menstrual cycle) may notice that their periods become irregular or are missed and may experience impaired fertility. if you are considering having children you should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts. aybintio has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. it has not been developed or made for injection into the eye. it is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. when aybintio is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may occur: 70 infection or inflammation of the eye globe, redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, increased eye pressure, bleeding in the eye. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v.
