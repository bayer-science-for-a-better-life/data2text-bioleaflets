This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nFIRDAPSE 10 mg tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach tablet contains amifampridine phosphate equivalent to 10 mg of amifampridine. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nTablet. \n\nWhite, round tablet, flat-faced on one side and scored on the other side. \n\nThe tablets can be divided into equal halves. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSymptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nFIRDAPSE should be given in divided doses, three or four times a day. The recommended starting \n\ndose is 15 mg amifampridine a day, which can be increased in 5 mg increments every 4 to 5 days, to a \n\nmaximum of 60 mg per day. No single dose should exceed 20 mg. \n\n \n\nTablets are to be taken with food. Please see section 5.2 for further information about bioavailability \n\nof amifampridine in the fed and fasted state. \n\n \n\nIf treatment is discontinued, patients may experience some of the symptoms of LEMS.  \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nFIRDAPSE should be used with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. A starting dose \n\nof 5 mg amifampridine (half tablet) once per day is recommended in patients with moderate or severe \n\nimpairment of renal or hepatic function. For patients with mild impairment of renal or hepatic \n\nfunction, a starting dose of 10 mg amifampridine (5 mg twice a day) per day is recommended. Patients \n\nshould be titrated more slowly than those without renal or hepatic impairment with doses increased \n\nin 5 mg increments every 7 days. If any adverse reaction occurs, upward dose titration should be \n\ndiscontinued (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of FIRDAPSE in children aged 0 to 17 years has not been established. No data \n\nare available.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor oral use only. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\n Epilepsy \n\n Uncontrolled asthma \n\n Concomitant use with sultopride (see sections 4.5 and 5.1) \n\n Concomitant use with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic window (see section 4.5) \n\n Concomitant use with medicinal products with a known potential to cause QTc prolongation  \n\n In patients with congenital QT syndromes (see section 4.4) \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amifampridine has been assessed in a single dose Phase I study in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In view of the risk of markedly \n\nincreased exposure to medicinal product, patients with renal or hepatic impairment must be carefully \n\nmonitored. The dose of amifampridine should be titrated more slowly in patients with renal and \n\nhepatic impairment than those with normal renal and hepatic function. Upward dose titration should be \n\ndiscontinued if any adverse reaction occurs (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSeizures \n\n \n\nExposure to amifampridine is associated with an increased risk for epileptic seizures. The risk of \n\nseizures is dose-dependent and is increased in patients with risk factors which lower the epileptic \n\nthreshold; including use in combination with other medicinal products known to lower the epileptic \n\nthreshold (see section 4.5). In the event of a seizure, treatment should be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity risk \n\n \n\nIn a 2-year dietary carcinogenicity study, benign and malignant Schwannomas have been observed in \n\nrats treated with amifampridine (see section 5.3). Amifampridine was not genotoxic in a standard \n\nbattery of in vitro and in vivo tests. The correlation between the use of amifampridine and the \n\ndevelopment of tumours in humans is unknown at this time. \n\n \n\nMost Schwannomas are benign and asymptomatic. They can present in many locations, therefore the \n\nclinical presentation can be varied. A diagnosis of Schwannoma should be considered for patients who \n\npresent with symptoms such as a mass that is painful on palpation or symptoms similar to a \n\ncompressive neuropathy. Schwannomas are generally slow-growing and can exist for months to years \n\nwithout producing symptoms. The benefit of continuing treatment with amifampridine should be \n\nreviewed for any patient who develops a Schwannoma. \n\n \n\nAmifampridine should be used with caution in patients with an increased risk of Schwannomas, such \n\nas patients with past medical history of such tumours, neurofibromatosis Type 2 or schwannomatosis.  \n\n \n\nCardiac effects \n\n \n\nClinical and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring are indicated at the initiation of the treatment and \n\nyearly thereafter. In case of signs and symptoms indicative of cardiac arrhythmias, ECG should be \n\nperformed immediately. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nConcomitant diseases \n\n \n\nPatients must be told to inform any physician they consult that they are taking this medicinal product, \n\nsince close monitoring of a concomitant disease, particularly asthma, may be necessary. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nMedicinal products eliminated through metabolism or active secretion \n\nThere are no data on the effects of amifampridine on the metabolism or active secretion of other \n\nmedicinal products. Thus, special care should be taken in patients undergoing concomitant treatment \n\nwith medicinal products eliminated through metabolism or active secretion. Monitoring is advised \n\nwhen possible. The dose of the concomitantly given medicinal product should be adjusted if \n\nnecessary. Concomitant use of medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic window is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nSubstances which are potent inhibitors of enzymes that metabolise medicinal products (see \n\nsection 5.2) \n\nPotent cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme inhibitors e.g. cimetidine, ketoconazole are not likely to \n\ninhibit the metabolism of amifampridine by human N-acetyl-transferase enzymes (NATs) giving rise \n\nto increased amifampridine exposure. The results from the in vitro CYP450 inhibition study indicate \n\namifampridine is unlikely to play a role in metabolic-based clinical drug-drug interactions related to \n\ninhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and \n\nCYP3A4 metabolism of co-administered medicinal products. Regardless, patients should be closely \n\nmonitored for adverse reactions when initiating treatment with a potent enzyme or renal transporter \n\ninhibitor. If treatment with a potent inhibitor is discontinued, patients should be monitored for efficacy \n\nas an increase of amifampridine dose may be necessary. \n\n \n\nSubstances which are potent inducers of enzymes that metabolise medicinal products (see section 5.2) \n\nThe results from in vitro studies suggest there is low potential for drug-drug interactions due to \n\nenzyme induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 enzymes by amifampridine.  \n\n  \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nBased on the pharmacodynamic properties of amifampridine, the concomitant use with sultopride or \n\nother medicinal products known to cause QT prolongation (e.g., disopyramide, cisapride, \n\ndomperidone, rifampicin and ketoconazole) is contraindicated as this combination may lead to an \n\nenhanced risk of ventricular tachycardia, notably torsade de pointes (see sections 4.3 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCombinations requiring precautions for use \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to lower the epileptic threshold \n\nThe concomitant use of amifampridine and substances known to lower the epileptic threshold may \n\nlead to an increased risk of seizures. The decision to administer proconvulsant or epileptic-threshold \n\nlowering substances concomitantly should be carefully considered in the light of the severity of the \n\nassociated risks. These substances include most anti-depressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective \n\nserotonin uptake inhibitors), neuroleptics (phenothiazines and butyrophenones), mefloquine, \n\nbupropion and tramadol (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCombinations to be taken into consideration \n\n \n\nMedicinal products with atropinic effects \n\nThe concomitant use of amifampridine and medicinal products with atropinic effects may reduce the \n\neffect of both active substances and should be taken into consideration. Medicinal products with \n\natropinic effects include tricyclic anti-depressants, most H1 atropinic anti-histamines, anticholinergic, \n\n\n\n5 \n\nanti-Parkinson medicinal products, atropinic antispasmodics, disopyramide, phenothiazine \n\nneuroleptics and clozapine. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products with cholinergic effects \n\nThe concomitant use of amifampridine and medicinal products with cholinergic effects (e.g. direct or \n\nindirect cholinesterase inhibitors) may lead to an increased effect of both products and should be taken \n\ninto consideration. \n\n \n\nNon depolarising muscle relaxant acting medicinal products \n\nThe concomitant use of amifampridine and medicinal products with non-depolarising muscle relaxant \n\neffects (e.g. mivacurium, pipercurium) may lead to a decreased effect of both products and should be \n\ntaken into consideration. \n\n \n\nDepolarising muscle relaxant acting medicinal products \n\nThe concomitant use of amifampridine and medicinal products with depolarising muscle relaxant \n\neffects (e.g. suxamethonium) may lead to a decreased effect of both products and should be taken into \n\nconsideration. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nFIRDAPSE should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential must use effective \n\ncontraception during FIRDAPSE treatment. No adequate clinical data on exposed pregnancies are \n\navailable for amifampridine. Amifampridine has shown no effect on embryo-foetal viability and \n\ndevelopment in rabbits; however, in rats, an increase in the number of mothers delivering still-born \n\noffspring was observed (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether amifampridine is excreted in human breast milk. Available reproductive data in \n\nanimals have shown presence of amifampridine in milk of breast-feeding mothers. Assessment of \n\nbreast-feeding neo-natal animals showed no indication of adverse reactions when exposed to \n\namifampridine through breast-milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or \n\nto discontinue/abstain from FIRDAPSE therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for \n\nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNon-clinical safety data are available regarding the effects of amifampridine on reproductive function. \n\nNo impairment of fertility has been observed in non-clinical studies with amifampridine (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nDue to adverse reactions such as drowsiness, dizziness, seizures and blurred vision, amifampridine \n\nmay have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are paraesthesias (such as peripheral and peribucal \n\nparaesthesias) and gastro-intestinal disorders (such as epigastralgia, diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal \n\npain). The intensity and incidence of most adverse reactions is dose-dependent. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1 below lists the adverse reactions reported with amifampridine.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as: Very common (≥ 1/10), Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), Rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), Very rare (< 1/10,000) and Unknown (cannot \n\nbe estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \n\norder of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nFrequencies were estimated based on a clinical study to evaluate the effects of amifampridine on \n\ncardiac repolarization at a single dose of 30 mg or 60 mg in healthy volunteers.  \n\n \n\nTable 1:  Adverse Reactions Reported with FIRDAPSE \n\n \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem organ class \n\nMedDRA \n\nPreferred term \n\nFrequency \n\nPsychiatric disorders Sleep disorders, anxiety Unknown \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nConvulsions, chorea, myoclonia drowsiness, \n\nweakness, fatigue, headache  \n\nUnknown \n\nDizziness1, hypoaesthesia1, paraesthesia1 Very common \n\nEye disorders Blurred vision Unknown \n\nCardiac disorders Cardiac rhythm disorders, palpitations Unknown \n\nVascular disorders Raynaud's syndrome Unknown \n\nCold extremities1 Common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nBronchial hypersecretion, asthma attack in asthmatic \n\npatients or patients with a history of asthma, cough \n\n \n\nUnknown \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nHypoaesthasia oral1, paraesthesia oral1, peripheral and \n\nperibucal paraesthesias, nausea1 \n\nVery common \n\nAbdominal pain Common \n\nDiarrhoea, epigastralgia  Unknown \n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders \n\nElevated liver enzyme levels (transaminases) \n\n \n\nUnknown \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ndisorders \n\nHyperhidrosis1, cold sweat1 Very common \n\n1 Adverse reactions reported in a clinical study to evaluate the effects of amifampridine on cardiac \n\nrepolarization at a single dose of 30 mg or 60 mg in healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThere is little experience with overdose. The manifestations of acute overdose include vomiting and \n\nabdominal pain. Patient should discontinue the treatment in the event of overdose. No specific antidote \n\nis known. Supportive care should be given as clinically indicated, including close monitoring of vital \n\nsigns. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX05. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAmifampridine blocks voltage-dependent potassium channels, thereby prolonging pre-synaptic cell \n\nmembrane depolarisation. Prolonging the action potential enhances the transport of calcium into the \n\nnerve ending. The resulting increase in intra-cellular calcium concentrations facilitates exocytosis of \n\nacetylcholine-containing vesicles, which in turn enhances neuromuscular transmission. \n\n \n\nIt improves muscle strength and resting compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes with \n\nan overall weighted mean difference of 1.69 mV (95% CI 0.60 to 2.77). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nThe pharmacodynamic profile of amifampridine has been studied for a range of doses. A prospective, \n\nplacebo-controlled, randomised study in 26 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome \n\n(LEMS) reported clinical efficacy for amifampridine at the standard recommended maximum dose \n\nof 60 mg/day (Sanders et al 2000). Two further studies in a total of 57 patients with LEMS have \n\nreported data from higher doses of amifampridine. McEvoy et al 1989 reported data from a short-term \n\nstudy in 12 patients with LEMS, which demonstrated that administration of amifampridine at doses up \n\nto 100 mg/day for a period of 3 days was effective in treating the autonomic and motor symptoms of \n\nLEMS. Sanders et al 1998 presented data on efficacy and safety of amifampridine treatment at doses \n\nup to 100 mg/day in 45 patients with LEMS who were treated for an average of 31 months. Therefore, \n\nin exceptional circumstances higher doses up to a maximum of 80 mg/day may be of benefit when \n\ngiven with the appropriate safety monitoring. It is recommended that dose titration from 60 mg/day \n\nto 80 mg/day is performed in 5 mg increments every 7 days. Upward dose titration should be \n\ndiscontinued if any adverse reaction or ECG abnormality is observed. \n\n \n\nThe effect of a single dose of 30 mg or 60 mg of amifampridine phosphate was used to evaluate the \n\npharmacokinetic-QTc relationship of amifampridine concentration on cardiac repolarization exposure \n\nin healthy volunteers. This evaluation was conducted in a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, \n\ncrossover study to define the ECG effects of amifampridine phosphate at these doses compared to \n\nplacebo and moxifloxacin (a positive control) in healthy men and women who are slow acetylators \n\n(n=52). There was no effect of amifampridine phosphate on heart rate, atrioventricular conduction or \n\ncardiac depolarization as measured by the heart rate, PR and QRS interval durations. No subjects \n\ndeveloped new clinically relevant ECG morphological changes following administration of \n\namifampridine phosphate. No effect was observed of amifampridine phosphate on cardiac \n\nrepolarization as assessed using the QTc interval. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety \n\nof amifampridine phosphate in Patients with LEMS was conduct in adult patients 18 years of age or \n\nolder (n=26). The patients were maintained on a stable dose and frequency of amifampridine \n\nphosphate for at least 7 days prior to randomization. In this four-day study, patients were randomized \n\n(1:1) to amifampridine phosphate (at patient’s optimal dose) or placebo on Day 0. Baseline \n\nassessments were obtained on day 0. The primary endpoints were change from baseline (CFB) in \n\nPatient Global Impression (SGI) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score at Day 4. A \n\nsecondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 4 in CGI-I score, which was \n\ndetermined by treating physicians. Patients were allowed to use stable doses of peripherally acting \n\ncholinesterase inhibitors or corticosteroids. Patients with recent use of immunomodulatory therapies \n\n(e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine), rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin G, and \n\nplasmapheresis were excluded from the study. Patients had a median age of 55.5 years \n\n(range: 31 to 75 years) and 62% were female and 38% were male. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nFollowing the 4 day double-blind discontinuation period, patients treated with amifampridine \n\nphosphate maintained muscle strength compared to patients treated with placebo who showed \n\nworsening of muscle strength. Observed mean difference in QMG Total and SGI change from baseline \n\nscore between treatments were -6.54 (95% CI: -9.78, -3.29; p=0.0004) and 2.95 (95% CI: 1.53, 4.38; \n\np=0.0003) respectively, both statistically significant in favour of amifampridine phosphate. In \n\naddition, CGI-I scores at day 4 as determined by physicians showed significant improvement in \n\npatients remaining on amifampridine phosphate compared to placebo (p=0.0020). \n\n \n\nSummary of Changes in Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints from Baseline \n\n \n\nAssessment Amifampridine (n=13) Placebo (n=13) \n\nQMG Scoresa \n\nLS Meand  0.00 6.54 \n\nLS Mean Diff (95% CI) -6.54 (-9.78, -3.29) \n\np-valued 0.0004 \n\nSGI Scoresb \n\nLS Meand  -0.64 -3.59 \n\nLS Mean Diff (95% CI) 2.95 (1.53, 4.38) \n\np-valued 0.0003 \n\nCGI-I Scoresc \n\nMean (SD)  3.8 (0.80) 5.5 (1.27) \n\np-valuee 0.0020 \na Total QMG score range 0 – 39, 13 items, 0-3 points on each test.

A 2-fold increase in the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was observed in the presence of food. Similarly \n\nCmax and AUC0-∞ were greater in the fasted state than in the fed state. Overall, food slowed and \n\ndecreased the absorption of amifampridine with a lowering of exposure by Cmax on average by ~44% \n\nand lowered exposure by AUC ~20%. based on geometric mean ratios (fed-to-fasted).  \n\n \n\nApparent plasma terminal elimination half-life differences were 3-4 fold between subjects in the food \n\neffect study. Bioavailability is approximately 93-100% based on recoveries of unmetabolised \n\namifampridine and a major 3-N-acetylated amifampridine metabolite in urine.  \n\n \n\nTable 2:  PK Parameters for Amifampridine in Fed and Fasted Subjects Following \n\nAdministration of a Single Oral Dose of Amifampridine Phosphate \n\n \n\nAmifampridi\n\nne \n\n20 mg  \n\nCmax \n\n(ng/ml) \n\nmean (S.D.), \n\nrange \n\nAUC0-∞ \n\n(ng∙hr/ml)  \n\nMean (S.D.), \n\nrange \n\nTmax \n\n(hr) \n\nmean(S.D.), range \n\nt1/2 \n\n(hr) \n\nmean (S.D.), range \n\nFasted (N=45) 59.1 (34.4), 16-13\n\n7 \n\n117 (76.6), 22.1-2\n\n71 \n\n \n\n0.637 (0.247), 0.25-\n\n1.5 \n\n2.5 (0.73), 1.23-4.31 \n\nFed* (N=46) 40.6 (31.3), 2.81-1\n\n32 \n\n109 (76.4), 9.66-2\n\n92 \n\n \n\n1.31 (0.88), 0.5-4.0 2.28 (0.704), 0.822-3\n\n.78 \n\n*  Eating a standardised high-fat meal \n\n \n\nIn a study of healthy volunteers, systemic exposure of amifampridine was notably influenced by the \n\noverall metabolic acetylation activity of NAT enzymes and NAT2 genotype. The NAT genes are \n\nhighly polymorphic and result in phenotypes with variable acetylation activity rates ranging from slow \n\nto fast. In the healthy volunteer study, fast acetylators were defined by having a caffeine metabolite \n\nratio >0.3 and slow acetylators with a caffeine metabolite ratio <0.2 . There was significantly higher \n\nexposure to amifampridine in slow acetylators compared to fast acetylators. Statistically significant \n\ndifferences in amifampridine PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-∞, t1/2 and apparent clearance was observed \n\nbetween fast and slow acetylators at all dose levels. In this study, slow acetylators experienced more \n\nadverse reactions than the fast acetylators. The safety profile in this study is consistent with adverse \n\nreactions observed with patients on amifampridine. \n\n \n\nhttp://pdr3d.com/detail.php?c=12671#footnote-1\nhttp://pdr3d.com/detail.php?c=12671#footnote-reference-1\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 3:  Mean PK Parameters of Amifampridine in Healthy Subjects after Single Oral Doses \n\n(5-30mg) in Slow and Fast Acetylator Phenotypes \n\n \n\nAmifampridi\n\nne Dose (mg) \n\n5 10 20 30 \n\nSubjects (N) 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 \n\nAcetylator \n\nPhenotype \n\nFast Slow Fast Slow Fast Slow Fast Slow \n\nMean Amifampridine PK Parameters \n\nAUC0-t \n(ng∙hr/ml ) \n\n2.89 30.1 9.55 66.3 24.7 142 43.5 230 \n\nAUC0-∞ \n(ng∙hr/ml) \n\n3.57 32.1 11.1 68.9 26.2 146 45.2 234 \n\nCmax (ng/ml) 3.98 17.9 9.91 34.4 16.2 56.7 25.5 89.6 \n\nTmax (hr) 0.750 0.830 0.805 1.14 1.04 1.07 0.810 1.29 \n\nt 1/2 (hr) 0.603 2.22 1.21 2.60 1.23 2.93 1.65 3.11 \n\nThe mean caffeine acetylator ratio for these 12 subjects receiving four escalating doses \n\nwere 0.408 and 0.172 for fast and slow acetylators types respectively.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nDistribution of amifampridine was studied in the rat. Following oral administration of radiolabelled \n\n[14C] amifampridine, radioactive material is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and \n\nwidely distributed throughout the body. Concentrations in tissues are generally similar to or greater \n\nthan concentrations in plasma, with the greatest concentration in organs of excretion (liver, kidney and \n\nthe gastrointestinal tract) and some tissues of glandular function (lacrimal, salivary, mucous, pituitary \n\nand thyroid glands). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in humans indicate that amifampridine is metabolised to a single \n\nmajor 3-N-acetylated amifampridine metabolite.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nIn humans, 93.2% to 100% of amifampridine is excreted into the urine within 24 hours after dosing as \n\namifampridine (19%) and its 3-N-acetylated amifampridine metabolite (74.0% to 81.7%). The plasma \n\nelimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours for the amifampridine and 4 hours for \n\nthe 3-N-acetylated amifampridine metabolite.  \n\n \n\nThe overall clearance of amifampridine is predominantly due to metabolism by N-acetylation and \n\nacetylator phenotype has a greater effect on an individual’s metabolism and elimination of \n\namifampridine than does elimination by renal function (See Table 4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nExposure of amifampridine was generally higher in subjects with renal impairment than in subjects \n\nwith normal renal function; however, NAT2 phenotype had a greater effect on an individual’s \n\nexposure to amifampridine than renal function status (See Table 4). Amifampridine exposure by \n\nAUC0–∞ was up to 2-fold higher in slow acetylators and up to 3-fold higher in fast acetylators with \n\nsevere renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Exposure by Cmax was \n\nmarginally affected by renal impairment regardless of acetylation status.  \n\n \n\nIn contrast, the 3-N-acetyl metabolite exposure levels were affected to a greater extent by renal \n\nimpairment than those for amifampridine. The 3-N-acetyl metabolite exposure by AUC0–∞ was up \n\nto 6.8-fold higher in slow acetylators and up to 4-fold higher in fast acetylators with severe renal \n\nimpairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Exposure by Cmax was only marginally \n\n\n\n11 \n\naffected by renal impairment regardless of acetylation status. Although the metabolite is inactive at \n\npotassium channels, potential off target effects due to accumulation are unknown. \n\n \n\nTable 4:  Mean PK Parameters of Amifampridine in Normal and Renal Impaired Subjects \n\nafter Single Oral Dose Administration (10mg) in Slow and Fast Acetylator \n\nPhenotypes \n\n \n\nRenal \n\nStatus \n\nNormal Mild Moderate Severe \n\nSubjects \n\n(N) \n\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 \n\nNAT2 \n\nPhenotype \n\nFast Slow Fast Slow Fast Slow Fast Slow \n\nMean Amifampridine PK Parameters \n\nAUC 0-∞ \n(ng·h/ml) \n\n       \n\n 10.7\n\n  \n\n        \n\n59.1 \n\n        \n\n16.1  \n\n        \n\n81.3 \n\n        \n\n14.3  \n\n      \n\n126  \n\n        \n\n32.8  \n\n      \n\n119  \n\n \n\nCmax \n\n(ng/ml) \n\n          \n\n7.65  \n\n        \n\n38.6  \n\n        \n\n11.1  \n\n        \n\n33.5  \n\n          \n\n8.33  \n\n        \n\n52.5  \n\n          \n\n9.48  \n\n        \n\n44.1  \n\n \n\nTmax (hr) \n\n         \n\n 0.44\n\n  \n\n          \n\n0.43  \n\n          \n\n0.88  \n\n          \n\n0.88  \n\n          \n\n0.51  \n\n          \n\n0.55  \n\n          \n\n0.56  \n\n         \n\n 0.63  \n\n \n\nt1/2 (hr) \n\n         \n\n1.63  \n\n          \n\n2.71  \n\n          \n\n1.86  \n\n          \n\n2.95  \n\n          \n\n1.72  \n\n         \n\n3.89  \n\n          \n\n1.64  \n\n         \n\n 3.17  \n\nMean 3-N-acetyl Amifampridine PK Parameters \n\nAUC 0 -∞ \n(ng·h/ml) \n\n \n\n872 \n\n \n\n594 \n\n \n\n1264 \n\n \n\n1307 \n\n \n\n2724 \n\n \n\n1451 \n\n \n\n3525 \n\n \n\n4014 \n\n \n\nCmax \n\n(ng/ml) \n\n \n\n170 \n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\n208 \n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\n180 \n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\n164 \n\n \n\n178 \n\n \n\nTmax (hr) 1.13 0.75 1.44 1.38 2.00 1.13 1.63 \n\n \n\n2.81 \n\n \n\nt 1/2 (hr) 4.32 4.08 5.35 7.71 13.61 6.99 18.22 \n\n \n\n15.7 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the pharmacokinetics of amifampridine in patients with hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the pharmacokinetics of amifampridine in paediatric patients (see sections 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of amifampridine has not been studied.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nIn safety pharmacology studies in rats, no respiratory system related effects were seen up to 10 mg/kg \n\nor on the central nervous system up to 40 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nIn a repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, effects on the central and autonomic nervous system, \n\nincreased liver and kidney weights and cardiac effects (second degree atrioventricular block) were \n\n\n\n12 \n\nseen. No safety margins to human exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity \n\nof the animal models used. \n\n \n\nIn a 2-year rat dietary carcinogenicity study, amifampridine caused small but statistically significant \n\ndose-related increases in the incidence of Schwannomas in both genders and of endometrial \n\ncarcinomas in females. The clinical relevance of these results is unknown. \n\n \n\nAmifampridine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies evaluating the reproductive and developmental toxicity of amifampridine were \n\nconducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day. Amifampridine had no adverse reaction on \n\nmale or female fertility in rats at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day, and no effect on post-natal development or \n\nfertility was observed in the offspring of the treated animals. In a perinatal/postnatal reproduction \n\nstudy in pregnant rats treated with amifampridine, a dose-related increase in the percentage of mothers \n\nwith stillborn offspring (16.7%-20%) was observed at 22.5 mg/kg/day and 75 mg/kg/day \n\n(1.1 and 2.7 times the 80 mg per day dose in humans based on Cmax). However, in a similar study in \n\npregnant rabbits, there was no effect on embryo-foetal viability when evaluated just prior to birth at \n\ndoses up to 57 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What FIRDAPSE is and what is it used for \n\n \n\nFIRDAPSE is used to treat symptoms of a disease of the nerves and the muscles called Lambert-Eaton \n\nmyasthenic syndrome or LEMS in adults. This disease is a disorder affecting the transmission of nerve \n\nimpulses to muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. It can be associated with certain tumour types \n\n(paraneoplastic form of LEMS) or in the absence of these tumours (non-paraneoplastic form of \n\nLEMS). \n\n \n\nIn patients suffering from this disease, a chemical substance called acetylcholine, which communicates \n\nnerve impulses to muscles is not released normally and the muscle doesn't receive some or all of the \n\nnerve's signals.  \n\n \n\nFIRDAPSE works by increasing the release of acetylcholine and helps the muscle to receive the nerve \n\nsignals. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take FIRDAPSE \n\n \n\nDo not take FIRDAPSE \n\n If you are allergic to amifampridine, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6) \n\n If you have uncontrolled asthma \n\n If you are epileptic \n\n Together with medicines that may change the electrical activity of your heart (QT-interval \nprolongation - detectable in the electrocardiogram), such as: \n\n Sultropride (a medicine prescribed to treat certain behavioural disorders in adults),  \n\n Antiarrhythmic medicine (e.g., disopyramide)  \n\n Medicines to treat digestive problems (e.g., cisapride, domperidone) \n\n\n\n24 \n\n Medicines to treat infections - antibiotics (e.g., rifampicin) and antifungals (e.g., \nketoconazole) \n\n Together with medicines with a therapeutic dose close to the maximum safe dose \n\n If you were born with heart problems (congenital QT syndromes) \n \n\nIf you have any doubts, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking FIRDAPSE. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you have  \n\n Asthma \n\n A history of fits (convulsions) \n\n Kidney problems \n\n Liver problems \n \n\nYour doctor will monitor carefully how FIRDAPSE works for you and may need to change the dose \n\nof the medicines you take.
