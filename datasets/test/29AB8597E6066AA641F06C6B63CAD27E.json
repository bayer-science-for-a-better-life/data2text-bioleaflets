NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTopotecan Actavis 1 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 1 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride).  \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml concentrate contains 1 mg topotecan. \n \nExcipient with known effect:  \nEach vial contains 0.52 mg (0.0225 mmol) sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nYellow lyophilisate. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTopotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer \n(SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nTopotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix \nrecurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to \ncisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in \nthe use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nWhen used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for cisplatin should be \nconsulted. \n \nPrior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count \nof \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of \u2265 100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion \nif necessary). \n \nSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma \n\n \nInitial dose \n\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area/day administered by intravenous \ninfusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three week interval between the start \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nof each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1).  \n \nSubsequent doses \n\nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is \u2265 1 x 109/l, the platelet count \nis \u2265 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil \ncount < 0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, \nor who have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.25 mg/m2/day \nto 1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \n\nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical trials, \ntopotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2 and a further dose reduction \nwas required to manage adverse effects. \n \nCervical Carcinoma \n\n \nInitial dose \n\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as 30 minute intravenous \ninfusion daily on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a \ndose of 50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every \n21 days for six courses or until progressive disease. \n \nSubsequent doses \n\nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is more than or equal to \n1.5 x 109/l, the platelet count is more than or equal to 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is more \nthan or equal to 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count less than \n0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection or who \nhave had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20 % to \n0.60 mg/m2/day for subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. \n \nDosage in renally impaired patients \n\n \n\nMonotherapy (Small cell lung carcinoma) \n\nInsufficient data are available to make a recommendation for patients with a creatinine \nclearance <20 ml/min. Limited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment. The recommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with small cell lung \ncarcinoma and a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for \nfive consecutive days. \n \nCombination therapy (Cervical carcinoma) \n\nIn clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical cancer, \ntherapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl. If, during \ntopotecan/cisplatin combination therapy serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl, it is recommended that \nthe full prescribing information be consulted for any advice on cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data regarding continuing monotherapy with \ntopotecan in patients with cervical cancer. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe experience in children is limited, therefore no recommendation for treatment of paediatric \npatients with Topotecan Actavis can be given (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTopotecan Actavis is for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. It must be \nreconstituted and further diluted before use (see section 6.6). \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nReconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product must be performed by trained personnel. The \npreparation should be performed in a designated area under aseptic conditions.  \nAdequate protective disposable gloves, goggles, gown and mask should be worn. Precautions should \nbe taken to avoid the medicinal product accidentally coming into contact with the eyes. In the event of \ncontact with the eyes, irrigate with large amounts of water. Then seek medical evaluation by a \nphysician. In case of skin contact, thoroughly wash the affected area with large amount of water. \nAlways wash hands after removing gloves. See section 6.6. \n \nPregnant staff should not handle the cytotoxic preparation. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTopotecan is contraindicated in patients who \n- have a history of severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1 \n- are breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n- already have severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by \n\nbaseline neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of < 100 x 109/l. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be monitored \nregularly (see section 4.2). \n \nAs with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. \nMyelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8). \n \nTopotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis \nhave been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and \na compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. \n \nTopotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have \nbeen fatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung \ncancer, thoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating \nfactors. Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, \ndyspnoea and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is \nconfirmed. \n \nTopotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with \nclinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account, when prescribing topotecan \ne.g. in case patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nAs expected, patients with poor performance status (PS > 1) have a lower response rate and an \nincreased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). Accurate \nassessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that patients have \nnot deteriorated to performance status 3. \n \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum \nbilirubin \u2265 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in these patient \ngroups. \n \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2 for five days every three weeks. A reduction in topotecan \nclearance was observed. However there are insufficient data available to make a dose \nrecommendation for this patient group. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTopotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In an intravenous population \nstudy, the coadministration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did not appear to \nhave a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nIn combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal \nproduct may be required to improve tolerability. However, in combining with platinum agents, there is \na distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on \nday 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan \ndosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each \nagent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. \n \nWhen topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on Day 1) were \nadministered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12 %, n=9) and \nCmax (23 %, n=11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nAs with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, effective contraceptive methods must be advised when either \npartner is treated with topotecan. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nTopotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies \n(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and \ntherefore women of child bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during \ntherapy with topotecan.  \n \nPregnancy \nIf topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with \ntopotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nBreastfeeding \nTopotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Although it is not known \nwhether topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start \nof therapy. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats (see \nsection 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products topotecan is genotoxic and effects \non fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \ncaution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn dose-finding trials involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients with \nrelapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was found to be \nhaematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of cumulative \nhaematological or non-haematological toxicity. \n \nThe adverse event profile for topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical \ncancer clinical trials is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall \nhaematological toxicity is lower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin \ncompared to topotecan monotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone. \n \nAdditional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin, \nhowever, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and not attributable to topotecan. The \nprescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse events associated \ncisplatin use. \n \nThe integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported \nevents). Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), including \nisolated reports and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common: infection \nCommon: sepsis1 \n\n \n\n1Fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.4) \n\n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \n\nVery common:  \n\n \nfebrile neutropenia \nneutropenia (see Gastrointestinal disorders below) \nthrombocytopenia \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nanaemia \nleukopenia \n \n\nCommon:  \n\n \n\npancytopenia \n \n\nNot known: severe bleeding (associated with thrombocytopenia) \n \nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon:  \n\n \n\nhypersensitivity reaction including rash \n\nRare: anaphylactic reaction \nangioedema \nurticaria \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common:  anorexia (which may be severe) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nRare: interstitial lung disease (some cases have been fatal) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common:  \n\n \nnausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all of which may be severe) \nconstipation \nabdominal pain2 \nmucositis \n \n2Neutropenic colitis, including fatal neutropenic colitis, has \nbeen reported to occur as a complication of topotecan-\ninduced neutropenia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCommon:  hyperbilirubinaemia \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common:  \n\n \nalopecia \n \n\nCommon:  pruritus \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common:  \n\n \npyrexia \nasthenia \nfatigue \n \n\nCommon:  malaise \n \n\nVery rare:  extravasation3 \n \n3Extravasation has been reported very rarely.

In \nassociation with severe neutropenia, fever or infection occurred in 16 % of patients during course 1 \nand overall in 23 % of patients (6 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was \nnine days and the median duration was seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in \n11 % of courses overall. Among all patients treated in clinical trials (including both those with severe \nneutropenia and those who did not develop severe neutropenia), 11 % (4 % of courses) developed \nfever and 26 % (9 % of courses) developed infection. In addition, 5 % of all patients treated (1 % of \ncourses) developed sepsis (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombocytopenia: Severe (platelets less than 25 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (8 % of courses); \nmoderate (platelets between 25.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (15 % of courses). Median time \nto onset of severe thrombocytopenia was Day 15 and the median duration was five days. Platelet \ntransfusions were given in 4 % of courses. Reports of significant sequelae associated with \nthrombocytopenia including fatalities due to tumour bleeds have been infrequent. \n \nAnaemia: Moderate to severe (Hb \u2264 8.0 g/dl) in 37 % of patients (14 % of courses). Red cell \ntransfusions were given in 52 % of patients (21 % of courses). \n \nNon-haematological \n\nFrequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal such as nausea (52 %), vomiting \n(32 %), and diarrhoea (18 %), constipation (9 %) and mucositis (14 %). Severe (grade 3 or 4) nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis incidence was 4, 3, 2 and 1 % respectively. \n \nMild abdominal pain was also reported amongst 4 % of patients. \n \nFatigue was observed in approximately 25 % and asthenia in 16 % of patients whilst receiving \ntopotecan. Severe (grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia incidence was 3 and 3 % respectively. \n \nTotal or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30 % of patients and partial alopecia in 15 % of \npatients. \n \nOther severe events occurring in patients that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan \ntreatment were anorexia (12 %), malaise (3 %) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 %). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported rarely. In clinical trials, rash was reported in 4 % of patients and pruritus in 1.5 % of patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdoses have been reported in patients being treated with intravenous topotecan (up to 10 fold of \nthe recommended dose) and topotecan capsules (up to 5 fold of the recommended dose).  The \nobserved signs and symptoms for overdose were consistent with the known undesirable events \nassociated with topotecan (see section 4.8). The primary complications of overdose are bone marrow \nsuppression and mucositis. In addition, elevated hepatic enzymes have been reported with intravenous \ntopotecan overdose. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nThere is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. Further management should be as clinically \nindicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX17. \n \nThe anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme \nintimately involved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the \nmoving replication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of \nenzyme and strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular \nsequela of inhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA \nsingle-strand breaks. \n \nRelapsed SCLC \n\nA phase III trial (study 478) compared oral topotecan plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) (n = 71) with \nBSC alone (n = 70) in patients who had relapsed following first line therapy (median time to \nprogression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan + BSC, 90 days for BSC) and for \nwhom retreatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. Oral topotecan \nplus BSC group had a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the BSC \nalone group (Log-rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for oral topotecan plus BSC group \nrelative to BSC alone group was 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.45, 0.90). The median survival for patients treated \nwith topotecan + BSC was 25.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 18.3, 31.6) compared to 13.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 11.1, \n18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). \n \nPatient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for \nsymptom benefit for oral topotecan + BSC. \n \nOne Phase 2 study (Study 065) and one Phase 3 study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed \u2265 90 days after \ncompletion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were \nassociated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-\nreports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 1.

In those \n(n = 102) with recurrence after 180 days, the median survival in the topotecan plus cisplatin arm was \n9.9 months (95 % C.I.: 7, 12.6) versus 6.3 months (95 % C.I.: 4.9, 9.5) for the cisplatin arm with a \nhazard ratio of 0.75 (0.49, 1.16). \n \nPaediatric population \n\nTopotecan was also evaluated in the paediatric population; however, only limited data on efficacy and \nsafety are available. \n \nIn an open-label trial involving children (n = 108, age range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent or \nprogressive solid tumours, topotecan was administered at a starting dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given as a \n30 minute infusion for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending on response to \ntherapy. Tumour types included were Ewing's Sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, \nneuroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Antitumour activity was demonstrated \nprimarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric patients with recurrent \nand refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this study, \nforty-six (43 %) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1 %) courses; sixty-five (60 %) received \ntransfusions of Packed Red Blood Cells and fifty (46 %) of platelets over 139 and 159 courses \n(30.5 % and 34.9 %) respectively. Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the \nmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0 mg/m2/day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day \nwithout G-CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30 minute \ninfusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22), \ncorresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of \ndistribution, about 132 l, (SD 57) and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of \npharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of \ndosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. There is \nlittle or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change \nin the PK after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate plasma protein binding of topotecan is low \n(35 %) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous. \n \nThe elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of clearance of \ntopotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened carboxylate. \n \nMetabolism accounts for < 10 % of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, which \nwas shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was found in urine, \nplasma, and faeces. The mean metabolite:parent AUC ratio was less than 10 % for both total \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\ntopotecan and topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl \ntopotecan has been identified in the urine. \n \nOverall recovery of medicinal product-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was 71 \nto 76 % of the administered IV dose. Approximately 51 % was excreted as total topotecan and 3 % \nwas excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan accounted \nfor 18 % while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 %. Overall, the N-desmethyl \nmetabolite contributed a mean of less than 7 % (range 4-9 %) of the total medicinal product related \nmaterial accounted for in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and N-desmethyl \ntopotecan-O-glucuronide in the urine were less than 2.0 %. \n \nIn vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of \nN-demethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, \nCYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A or CYP4A nor did it inhibit the human \ncytosolic enzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase. \n \nWhen given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance of \ntopotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to 21.3 l/h/m2 [n = 9]) (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) \ndecreased to about 67 % when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan half-life was \nincreased by about 30 % but no clear change in volume of distribution was observed. Plasma \nclearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic impairment only \ndecreased by about 10 % compared with the control group of patients. \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) decreased to \nabout 67 % compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly decreased and thus \nhalf-life only increased by 14 %. In patients with moderate renal impairment topotecan plasma \nclearance was reduced to 34 % of the value in control patients. Mean half-life increased from \n1.9 hours to 4.9 hours. \n \nIn a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant effect \non clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nPaediatrics \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two \nstudies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 mg/m2 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to \n12 years, n = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9), and young adults (aged 16 to 21 years, \nn = 9) with refractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 mg/m2 to \n5.2 mg/m2 in children (n = 8), adolescents (n = 3), and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In these \nstudies, there were no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among children, \nadolescents, and young adult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too limited to \ndraw definite conclusions. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nResulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma \ncells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also \nshown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; \nhowever, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nYellow lyophilisate. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTopotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer \n(SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nTopotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix \nrecurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to \ncisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in \nthe use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nWhen used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for cisplatin should be \nconsulted. \n \nPrior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count \nof \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of \u2265 100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion \nif necessary). \n \nSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma \n\n \nInitial dose \n\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area/day administered by intravenous \ninfusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three week interval between the start \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nof each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1).  \n \nSubsequent doses \n\nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is \u2265 1 x 109/l, the platelet count \nis \u2265 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil \ncount < 0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, \nor who have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.25 mg/m2/day \nto 1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \n\nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical trials, \ntopotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2 and a further dose reduction \nwas required to manage adverse effects. \n \nCervical Carcinoma \n\n \nInitial dose \n\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as 30 minute intravenous \ninfusion daily on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a \ndose of 50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every \n21 days for six courses or until progressive disease. \n \nSubsequent doses \n\nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is more than or equal to \n1.5 x 109/l, the platelet count is more than or equal to 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is more \nthan or equal to 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count less than \n0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection or who \nhave had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20 % to \n0.60 mg/m2/day for subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. \n \nDosage in renally impaired patients \n\n \n\nMonotherapy (Small cell lung carcinoma) \n\nInsufficient data are available to make a recommendation for patients with a creatinine \nclearance <20 ml/min. Limited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment. The recommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with small cell lung \ncarcinoma and a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for \nfive consecutive days. \n \nCombination therapy (Cervical carcinoma) \n\nIn clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical cancer, \ntherapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl. If, during \ntopotecan/cisplatin combination therapy serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl, it is recommended that \nthe full prescribing information be consulted for any advice on cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nIf cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data regarding continuing monotherapy with \ntopotecan in patients with cervical cancer. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe experience in children is limited, therefore no recommendation for treatment of paediatric \npatients with Topotecan Actavis can be given (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTopotecan Actavis is for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. It must be \nreconstituted and further diluted before use (see section 6.6). \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nReconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product must be performed by trained personnel. The \npreparation should be performed in a designated area under aseptic conditions.  \nAdequate protective disposable gloves, goggles, gown and mask should be worn. Precautions should \nbe taken to avoid the medicinal product accidentally coming into contact with the eyes. In the event of \ncontact with the eyes, irrigate with large amounts of water. Then seek medical evaluation by a \nphysician. In case of skin contact, thoroughly wash the affected area with large amount of water. \nAlways wash hands after removing gloves. See section 6.6. \n \nPregnant staff should not handle the cytotoxic preparation. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTopotecan is contraindicated in patients who \n- have a history of severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1 \n- are breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n- already have severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by \n\nbaseline neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of < 100 x 109/l. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be monitored \nregularly (see section 4.2). \n \nAs with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. \nMyelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8). \n \nTopotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis \nhave been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and \na compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. \n \nTopotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have \nbeen fatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung \ncancer, thoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating \nfactors. Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, \ndyspnoea and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is \nconfirmed. \n \nTopotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with \nclinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account, when prescribing topotecan \ne.g. in case patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nAs expected, patients with poor performance status (PS > 1) have a lower response rate and an \nincreased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). Accurate \nassessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that patients have \nnot deteriorated to performance status 3. \n \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum \nbilirubin \u2265 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in these patient \ngroups. \n \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2 for five days every three weeks. A reduction in topotecan \nclearance was observed. However there are insufficient data available to make a dose \nrecommendation for this patient group. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTopotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In an intravenous population \nstudy, the coadministration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did not appear to \nhave a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nIn combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal \nproduct may be required to improve tolerability. However, in combining with platinum agents, there is \na distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on \nday 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan \ndosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each \nagent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. \n \nWhen topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on Day 1) were \nadministered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12 %, n=9) and \nCmax (23 %, n=11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nAs with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, effective contraceptive methods must be advised when either \npartner is treated with topotecan. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nTopotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies \n(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and \ntherefore women of child bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during \ntherapy with topotecan.  \n \n\nPregnancy \nIf topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with \ntopotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nBreastfeeding \nTopotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Although it is not known \nwhether topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start \nof therapy. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats (see \nsection 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products topotecan is genotoxic and effects \non fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \ncaution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn dose-finding trials involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients with \nrelapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was found to be \nhaematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of cumulative \nhaematological or non-haematological toxicity. \n \nThe adverse event profile for topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical \ncancer clinical trials is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall \nhaematological toxicity is lower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin \ncompared to topotecan monotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone. \n \nAdditional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin, \nhowever, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and not attributable to topotecan. The \nprescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse events associated \ncisplatin use. \n \nThe integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported \nevents).

In \nassociation with severe neutropenia, fever or infection occurred in 16 % of patients during course 1 \nand overall in 23 % of patients (6 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was \nnine days and the median duration was seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in \n11 % of courses overall. Among all patients treated in clinical trials (including both those with severe \nneutropenia and those who did not develop severe neutropenia), 11 % (4 % of courses) developed \nfever and 26 % (9 % of courses) developed infection. In addition, 5 % of all patients treated (1 % of \ncourses) developed sepsis (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombocytopenia: Severe (platelets less than 25 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (8 % of courses); \nmoderate (platelets between 25.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (15 % of courses). Median time \nto onset of severe thrombocytopenia was Day 15 and the median duration was five days. Platelet \ntransfusions were given in 4 % of courses. Reports of significant sequelae associated with \nthrombocytopenia including fatalities due to tumour bleeds have been infrequent. \n \nAnaemia: Moderate to severe (Hb \u2264 8.0 g/dl) in 37 % of patients (14 % of courses). Red cell \ntransfusions were given in 52 % of patients (21 % of courses). \n \nNon-haematological \n\nFrequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal such as nausea (52 %), vomiting \n(32 %), and diarrhoea (18 %), constipation (9 %) and mucositis (14 %). Severe (grade 3 or 4) nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis incidence was 4, 3, 2 and 1 % respectively. \n \nMild abdominal pain was also reported amongst 4 % of patients. \n \nFatigue was observed in approximately 25 % and asthenia in 16 % of patients whilst receiving \ntopotecan. Severe (grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia incidence was 3 and 3 % respectively. \n \nTotal or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30 % of patients and partial alopecia in 15 % of \npatients. \n \nOther severe events occurring in patients that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan \ntreatment were anorexia (12 %), malaise (3 %) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 %). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported rarely. In clinical trials, rash was reported in 4 % of patients and pruritus in 1.5 % of patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX17. \n \nThe anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme \nintimately involved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the \nmoving replication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of \nenzyme and strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular \nsequela of inhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA \nsingle-strand breaks. \n \nRelapsed SCLC \n\nA phase III trial (study 478) compared oral topotecan plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) (n = 71) with \nBSC alone (n = 70) in patients who had relapsed following first line therapy (median time to \nprogression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan + BSC, 90 days for BSC and for \nwhom retreatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. Oral topotecan \nplus BSC group had a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the BSC \nalone group (Log-rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for oral topotecan plus BSC group \nrelative to BSC alone group was 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.45, 0.90). The median survival for patients treated \nwith topotecan + BSC was 25.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 18.3, 31.6) compared to 13.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 11.1, \n18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). \n \nPatient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for \nsymptom benefit for oral topotecan + BSC. \n \nOne Phase 2 study (Study 065) and one Phase 3 study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed \u2265 90 days after \ncompletion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were \nassociated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-\nreports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 1.

Median time to progression was similar in the \ntwo groups (13.3 weeks and 12.3 weeks respectively). Median survivals for the two groups were 25.0 \nand 24.7 weeks respectively.

Tumour types included were Ewing's Sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, \nneuroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Antitumour activity was demonstrated \nprimarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric patients with recurrent \nand refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this study, \nforty-six (43 %) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1 %) courses; sixty-five (60 %) received \ntransfusions of Packed Red Blood Cells and fifty (46 %) of platelets over 139 and 159 courses \n(30.5 % and 34.9 %) respectively. Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the \nmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0 mg/m2/day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day \nwithout G-CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30 minute \ninfusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22), \ncorresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of \ndistribution, about 132 l, (SD 57) and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of \npharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of \ndosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. There is \nlittle or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change \nin the PK after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate plasma protein binding of topotecan is low \n(35 %) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous. \n \nThe elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of clearance of \ntopotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened carboxylate. \n \nMetabolism accounts for < 10 % of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, which \nwas shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was found in urine, \nplasma, and faeces. The mean metabolite:parent AUC ratio was less than 10 % for both total \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\ntopotecan and topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl \ntopotecan has been identified in the urine. \n \nOverall recovery of medicinal product-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was 71 \nto 76 % of the administered IV dose. Approximately 51 % was excreted as total topotecan and 3 % \nwas excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan accounted \nfor 18 % while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 %. Overall, the N-desmethyl \nmetabolite contributed a mean of less than 7 % (range 4-9 %) of the total medicinal product related \nmaterial accounted for in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and N-desmethyl \ntopotecan-O-glucuronide in the urine were less than 2.0 %. \n \nIn vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of \nN-demethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, \nCYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A or CYP4A nor did it inhibit the human \ncytosolic enzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase. \n \nWhen given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance of \ntopotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to 21.3 l/h/m2 [n = 9]) (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) \ndecreased to about 67 % when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan half-life was \nincreased by about 30 % but no clear change in volume of distribution was observed. Plasma \nclearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic impairment only \ndecreased by about 10 % compared with the control group of patients. \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) decreased to \nabout 67 % compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly decreased and thus \nhalf-life only increased by 14 %. In patients with moderate renal impairment topotecan plasma \nclearance was reduced to 34 % of the value in control patients. Mean half-life increased from \n1.9 hours to 4.9 hours. \n \nIn a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant effect \non clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nPaediatrics \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two \nstudies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 mg/m2 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to \n12 years, n = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9), and young adults (aged 16 to 21 years, \nn = 9) with refractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 mg/m2 to \n5.2 mg/m2 in children (n = 8), adolescents (n = 3), and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In these \nstudies, there were no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among children, \nadolescents, and young adult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too limited to \ndraw definite conclusions. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nResulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma \ncells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also \nshown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; \nhowever, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n6.

if you have any kidney problems. your dose of topotecan actavis may need to be adjusted. topotecan actavis is not recommended in case of severe kidney impairment; - if you have liver problems. topotecan actavis is not recommended in case of severe liver impairment; - if you suffer from lung inflammation with signs such as cough, fever and difficulties in breathing, see also section 4 \"possible side effects\". topotecan actavis may cause a decrease in the number of blood clotting cells (platelets). this can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. rarely, it can lead to more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). talk to your doctor for advice on how to minimize the risk of bleeding. the incidence of side effects is more frequent in patients who are in poor general health. the doctor will evaluate your general health during the treatment and you should tell him/her in case you have fever, infection or are in some ways feeling unwell. use in children and adolescents the experience in children and adolescents is limited and treatment is therefore not recommended. other medicines and topotecan actavis tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding topotecan actavis should not be used in pregnant women, unless clearly necessary. if you are or think you might be pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. effective contraception methods should be used to avoid becoming pregnant/fathering a child while on treatment. ask your doctor for advice. patients who are concerned about their fertility should ask their doctor for counselling on fertility and family planning options prior to starting treatment. you must not breast-feed while on treatment with topotecan actavis. driving and using machines topotecan actavis can make you feel tired or weak. if you experience this, do not drive or use machines. topotecan actavis contains sodium this medicine contains

cells (leucotyes) in the blood. abnormal low number of neutrophil granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the blood, with or without fever. - unusual bruising or bleeding, sometimes severe, caused by a decrease in the number of blood clotting cells (platelets). - weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); tiredness; weakness. - feeling sick (nausea), vomiting; diarrhoea; stomach pain; constipation. - inflammation of the lining of the mouth and digestive tract. - fever. - infections. - hair loss. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) - allergic (hypersensitivity)

the number of all blood cells (pancytopenia) - feeling unwell. - serious blood infection, which can be fatal. - itching (pruritus). rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) - swelling caused by fluid build-up (angioedema) e.g. around the eyes and lips as well as hands, feet and throat. if severe it may cause breathing difficulties. - itchy rash (or hives). very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) - mild pain and inflammation at the site of injection due to accidental administration of the medicinal product into the surrounding tissue (extravasation) e.g. by leakage. if you are being treated for cervical cancer, you may get side effects from the other medicine (cisplatin) that you will be given along with topotecan actavis. reporting of side effects if
