CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEntecavir Accord is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (see \nsection 5.1) in adults with:  \n compensated liver disease and evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or \nfibrosis.  \n\n decompensated liver disease (see section 4.4) \n \nFor both compensated and decompensated liver disease, this indication is based on clinical trial data in \nnucleoside naive patients with HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative HBV infection. With respect to \npatients with lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B, see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nEntecavir Accord is also indicated for the treatment of chronic HBV infection in nucleoside naive \npaediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with compensated liver disease who have evidence of \nactive viral replication and persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nmoderate to severe inflammation and/or fibrosis. With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in \npaediatric patients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B \ninfection. \n \nEntecavir Accord is only available as 0.5 and 1 mg film-coated tablets. For patients who are not able \nto swallow tablets or for whom a dose reduction is recommended, other entecavir-containing products \nwith more suitable formulations may be available. \n \nPosology \n \nCompensated liver disease \n \nNucleoside naïve patients: the recommended dose in adults is 0.5 mg once daily, with or without food. \n \nLamivudine-refractory patients (i.e. with evidence of viraemia while on lamivudine or the presence of \nlamivudine resistance [LVDr] mutations) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): the recommended dose in adults is \n1 mg once daily, which must be taken on an empty stomach (more than 2 hours before and more than \n2 hours after a meal) (see section 5.2). In the presence of LVDr mutations, combination use of \nentecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross-resistance with either lamivudine \nor entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir monotherapy (see section 4.4.). \n \nDecompensated liver disease \n \nThe recommended dose for adult patients with decompensated liver disease is 1 mg once daily, which \nmust be taken on an empty stomach (more than 2 hours before and more than 2 hours after a meal) \n(see section 5.2). For patients with lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nDuration of therapy \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown. Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows: \n In HBeAg positive adult patients, treatment should be administered at least until 12 months after \n\nachieving HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection on \ntwo consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) or until HBs seroconversion or there \nis loss of efficacy (see section 4.4). \n\n In HBeAg negative adult patients, treatment should be administered at least until HBs \nseroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With prolonged treatment for more than \n2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy \nremains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nIn patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment cessation is not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFor appropriate dosing in the paediatric population, Entecavir Accord 0.5 mg film-coated tablets are \navailable and for dosages below 0.5 mg an oral solution may be available.  \n \nThe decision to treat paediatric patients should be based on careful consideration of individual patient \nneeds and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the value of baseline \nhistological information. The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with continued therapy must \nbe weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence of resistant hepatitis B \nvirus. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least \n12 months in patients with HBeAg negative disease. \n \nPaediatric patients with a body weight of at least 32.6 kg, should be administered a daily dose of one \n0.5 mg tablet with or without food. An oral solution may be available for patients with body weight \nless than 32.6 kg. \n \nThere are no recommendations for entecavir in children less than 2 years of age or weighing less than \n10 kg. \n \nDuration of therapy for paediatric patients \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown. In accordance with current paediatric practice \nguidelines, treatment discontinuation may be considered as follows: \n In HBeAg positive paediatric patients, treatment should be administered for at least 12 months \n\nafter achieving undetectable HBV DNA and HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg loss and anti-HBe \ndetection on two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) or until HBs \nseroconversion or there is loss of efficacy. Serum ALT and HBV DNA levels should be \nfollowed regularly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n\n In HBeAg negative paediatric patients, treatment should be administered until HBs \nseroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  \n\n \nPharmacokinetics in paediatric patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been studied. \n \nElderly: no dosage adjustment based on age is required. The dose should be adjusted according to the \npatient’s renal function (see dosage recommendations in renal impairment and section 5.2). \n \nGender and race: no dosage adjustment based on gender or race is required. \n \nRenal impairment: the clearance of entecavir decreases with decreasing creatinine clearance (see \nsection 5.2). Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, \nincluding those on haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A reduction \nof the daily dose using entecavir oral solution, as detailed in the table, is recommended. As an \nalternative, in case the oral solution is not available, the dose can be adjusted by increasing the dosage \ninterval, also shown in the table. The proposed dose modifications are based on extrapolation of \nlimited data, and their safety and effectiveness have not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, \nvirological response should be closely monitored.  \n \n\n Entecavir Accord dosage* \n\nCreatinine clearance \n(ml/min) \n\n \n\nNucleoside naïve patients \n \n \n\nLamivudine-refractory or \ndecompensated liver disease \n\n \n≥ 50 0.5 mg once daily 1 mg once daily \n\n30 - 49 0.25 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 48 hours \n\n0.5 mg once daily \n \n\n10 - 29 0.15 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 72 hours \n\n0.3 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 48 hours \n< 10 \n\nHaemodialysis or \nCAPD** \n\n0.05 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 5-7 days \n\n0.1 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 72 hours \n* for doses < 0.5 mg entecavir oral solution is recommended. \n** on haemodialysis days, administer entecavir after haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nEntecavir Accord should be taken orally. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal impairment: dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2). The proposed dose modifications are based on extrapolation of limited data, and their \nsafety and effectiveness have not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, virological response should be \nclosely monitored.  \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis: spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common \nand are characterised by transient increases in serum ALT. After initiating antiviral therapy, serum \nALT may increase in some patients as serum HBV DNA levels decline (see section 4.8). Among \nentecavir-treated patients on-treatment exacerbations had a median time of onset of 4-5 weeks. In \npatients with compensated liver disease, these increases in serum ALT are generally not accompanied \nby an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or hepatic decompensation. Patients with advanced \nliver disease or cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation following hepatitis \nexacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in patients who have discontinued hepatitis B \ntherapy (see section 4.2). Post-treatment exacerbations are usually associated with rising HBV DNA, \nand the majority appears to be self-limited. However, severe exacerbations, including fatalities, have \nbeen reported. \n \nAmong entecavir-treated nucleoside naive patients, post-treatment exacerbations had a median time to \nonset of 23-24 weeks, and most were reported in HBeAg negative patients (see section 4.8). Hepatic \nfunction should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at \nleast 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B \ntherapy may be warranted. \n \nPatients with decompensated liver disease: a higher rate of serious hepatic adverse events (regardless \nof causality) has been observed in patients with decompensated liver disease, in particular in those \nwith Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class C disease, compared with rates in patients with compensated \nliver function. Also, patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis \nand for specific renal adverse events such as hepatorenal syndrome. Therefore, clinical and laboratory \nparameters should be closely monitored in this patient population (see also sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: occurrences of lactic acidosis (in the absence \nof hypoxaemia), sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, \nhave been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. As entecavir is a nucleoside analogue, this \nrisk cannot be excluded. Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued when rapidly \nelevating aminotransferase levels, progressive hepatomegaly or metabolic/lactic acidosis of unknown \naetiology occur. Benign digestive symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, might be \nindicative of lactic acidosis development. Severe cases, sometimes with fatal outcome, were associated \nwith pancreatitis, liver failure/hepatic steatosis, renal failure and higher levels of serum lactate. \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing nucleoside analogues to any patient (particularly obese \nwomen) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease. These patients \nshould be followed closely. \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nTo differentiate between elevations in aminotransferases due to response to treatment and increases \npotentially related to lactic acidosis, physicians should ensure that changes in ALT are associated with \nimprovements in other laboratory markers of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nResistance and specific precaution for lamivudine-refractory patients: mutations in the HBV \npolymerase that encode lamivudine-resistance substitutions may lead to the subsequent emergence of \nsecondary substitutions, including those associated with entecavir associated resistance (ETVr). In a \nsmall percentage of lamivudine-refractory patients, ETVr substitutions at residues rtT184, rtS202 or \nrtM250 were present at baseline. Patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV are at higher risk of \ndeveloping subsequent entecavir resistance than patients without lamivudine resistance. The \ncumulative probability of emerging genotypic entecavir resistance after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years treatment \nin the lamivudine-refractory studies was 6%, 15%, 36%, 47% and 51%, respectively. Virological \nresponse should be frequently monitored in the lamivudine-refractory population and appropriate \nresistance testing should be performed. In patients with a suboptimal virological response after 24 \nweeks of treatment with entecavir, a modification of treatment should be considered (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1). When starting therapy in patients with a documented history of lamivudine-resistant HBV, \ncombination use of entecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross-resistance with \neither lamivudine or entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir monotherapy. \n \nPre-existing lamivudine-resistant HBV is associated with an increased risk for subsequent entecavir \nresistance regardless of the degree of liver disease; in patients with decompensated liver disease, \nvirologic breakthrough may be associated with serious clinical complications of the underlying liver \ndisease. Therefore, in patients with both decompensated liver disease and lamivudine-resistant HBV, \ncombination use of entecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross-resistance with \neither lamivudine or entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir monotherapy. \n \nPaediatric population: A lower rate of virologic response (HBV DNA < 50 IU/ml) was observed in \npaediatric patients with baseline HBV DNA ≥ 8.0 log10 IU/ml (see section 5.1). Entecavir should be \nused in these patients only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the child (e.g. \nresistance). Since some paediatric patients may require long-term or even lifetime management of \nchronic active hepatitis B, consideration should be given to the impact of entecavir on future treatment \noptions. \n \nLiver transplant recipients: renal function should be carefully evaluated before and during entecavir \ntherapy in liver transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (see section 5.2). \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: there are no data on the efficacy of entecavir in patients co-infected \nwith hepatitis C or D virus. \n \nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV co-infected patients not receiving concomitant \nantiretroviral therapy: entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients not \nconcurrently receiving effective HIV treatment. Emergence of HIV resistance has been observed when \nentecavir was used to treat chronic hepatitis B infection in patients with HIV infection not receiving \nhighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (see section 5.1). Therefore, therapy with entecavir \nshould not be used for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not receiving HAART. Entecavir has \nnot been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use. \n \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving concomitant antiretroviral therapy: entecavir has been studied \nin 68 adults with HIV/HBV co-infection receiving a lamivudine-containing HAART regimen (see \nsection 5.1). No data are available on the efficacy of entecavir in HBeAg-negative patients co-infected \nwith HIV. There are limited data on patients co-infected with HIV who have low CD4 cell counts \n(< 200 cells/mm3). \n \nGeneral: patients should be advised that therapy with entecavir has not been proven to reduce the risk \nof transmission of HBV and therefore appropriate precautions should still be taken. \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nSoy polysaccharides: This medicinal product contains soy polysaccharides. If you are allergic to soya, \ndo not use this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSince entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney (see section 5.2), coadministration with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase \nserum concentrations of either medicinal product. Apart from lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the effects of coadministration of entecavir with medicinal products that \nare excreted renally or affect renal function have not been evaluated. Patients should be monitored \nclosely for adverse reactions when entecavir is coadministered with such medicinal products. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and lamivudine, adefovir or tenofovir were \nobserved. \n \nEntecavir is not a substrate, an inducer or an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (see \nsection 5.2). Therefore CYP450 mediated drug interactions are unlikely to occur with entecavir. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential: given that the potential risks to the developing foetus are unknown, \nwomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception. \n \nPregnancy: there are no adequate data from the use of entecavir in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Entecavir Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \nThere are no data on the effect of entecavir on transmission of HBV from mother to newborn infant. \nTherefore, appropriate interventions should be used to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV. \n \nBreast-feeding: it is unknown whether entecavir is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological \ndata in animals have shown excretion of entecavir in milk (for details see section 5.3). A risk to the \ninfants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Entecavir \nAccord. \n \nFertility: toxicology studies in animals administered entecavir have shown no evidence of impaired \nfertility (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness, \nfatigue and somnolence are common side effects which may impair the ability to drive and use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \nIn clinical studies in patients with compensated liver disease, the most common adverse reactions of \nany severity with at least a possible relation to entecavir were headache (9%), fatigue (6%), dizziness \n(4%) and nausea (3%). Exacerbations of hepatitis during and after discontinuation of entecavir therapy \nhave also been reported (see section 4.4 and c. Description of selected adverse reactions). \n \nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on experience from postmarketing surveillance and four \nclinical studies in which 1,720 patients with chronic hepatitis B infection and compensated liver \n\n\n\n 8 \n\ndisease received double-blind treatment with entecavir (n = 862) or lamivudine (n = 858) for up to \n107 weeks (see section 5.1). In these studies, the safety profiles, including laboratory abnormalities, \nwere comparable for entecavir 0.5 mg daily (679 nucleoside-naive HBeAg positive or negative \npatients treated for a median of 53 weeks), entecavir 1 mg daily (183 lamivudine-refractory patients \ntreated for a median of 69 weeks), and lamivudine. \n \nAdverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with entecavir are listed by body \nsystem organ class. Frequency is defined as very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nImmune system disorders: \nrare : anaphylactoid reaction \nPsychiatric disorders: \ncommon : insomnia \nNervous system disorders: \ncommon : headache, dizziness, somnolence \nGastrointestinal disorders: \ncommon : vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, dyspepsia \nHepatobiliary disorders: \ncommon : increased transaminases \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nuncommon : rash, alopecia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \ncommon : \n\n \nfatigue \n\nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other \nserious medical conditions or drug exposures (see section 4.4). \n \nTreatment beyond 48 weeks: continued treatment with entecavir for a median duration of 96 weeks did \nnot reveal any new safety signals. \n \nc. Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities: In clinical studies with nucleoside-naive patients, 5% had ALT \nelevations > 3 times baseline, and < 1% had ALT elevations > 2 times baseline together with total \nbilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and > 2 times baseline. Albumin levels < 2.5 g/dl \noccurred in < 1% of patients, amylase levels > 3 times baseline in 2%, lipase levels > 3 times baseline \nin 11% and platelets < 50,000/mm3 in < 1%. \n \nIn clinical studies with lamivudine-refractory patients, 4% had ALT elevations > 3 times baseline, and \n< 1% had ALT elevations > 2 times baseline together with total bilirubin > 2 times ULN and > 2 times \nbaseline. Amylase levels > 3 times baseline occurred in 2% of patients, lipase levels > 3 times baseline \nin 18% and platelets < 50,000/mm3 in < 1%. \n \nExacerbations during treatment: in studies with nucleoside naive patients, on treatment ALT elevations \n> 10 times ULN and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2% of entecavir treated patients vs 4% of \nlamivudine treated patients. In studies with lamivudine-refractory patients, on treatment ALT \nelevations > 10 times ULN and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2% of entecavir treated patients vs 11% \nof lamivudine treated patients. Among entecavir-treated patients, on-treatment ALT elevations had a \nmedian time to onset of 4-5 weeks, generally resolved with continued treatment, and, in a majority of \ncases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the \nALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment. \n \nExacerbations after discontinuation of treatment: acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported \nin patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B virus therapy, including therapy with entecavir (see \nsection 4.4). In studies in nucleoside-naive patients, 6% of entecavir-treated patients and 10% of \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nlamivudine-treated patients experienced ALT elevations (> 10 times ULN and > 2 times reference \n[minimum of baseline or last end-of-dosing measurement]) during post-treatment follow-up. Among \nentecavir-treated nucleoside-naive patients, ALT elevations had a median time to onset of 23-\n24 weeks, and 86% (24/28) of ALT elevations occurred in HBeAg negative patients. In studies in \nlamivudine-refractory patients, with only limited numbers of patients being followed up, 11% of \nentecavir-treated patients and no lamivudine-treated patients developed ALT elevations during post-\ntreatment follow-up. \n \nIn the clinical trials entecavir treatment was discontinued if patients achieved a prespecified response. \nIf treatment is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment ALT flares \ncould be higher. \n \nd. Paediatric Population \n \nThe safety of entecavir in paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age is based on two ongoing \nclinical trials in subjects with chronic HBV infection; one Phase 2 pharmacokinetic trial (study 028) \nand one Phase 3 trial (study 189). These trials provide experience in 195 HBeAg-positive nucleoside-\ntreatment-naïve subjects treated with entecavir for a median duration of 99 weeks. The adverse \nreactions observed in paediatric subjects who received treatment with entecavir were consistent with \nthose observed in clinical trials of entecavir in adults.(see a. Summary of the safety profile and \nsection 5.1) \n \ne. Other special populations \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease: the safety profile of entecavir in patients \nwith decompensated liver disease was assessed in a randomized open-label comparative study in \nwhich patients received treatment with entecavir 1 mg/day (n = 102) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day \n(n = 89) (study 048). Relative to the adverse reactions noted in section b. Tabulated list of adverse \nreactions, one additional adverse reaction [decrease in blood bicarbonate (2%)] was observed in \nentecavir-treated patients through week 48. The on-study cumulative death rate was 23% (23/102), and \ncauses of death were generally liver-related, as expected in this population. The on-study cumulative \nrate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 12% (12/102). Serious adverse events were generally \nliver-related, with an on-study cumulative frequency of 69%. Patients with high baseline CTP score \nwere at higher risk of developing serious adverse events (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities: through week 48 among entecavir-treated patients with decompensated \nliver disease, none had ALT elevations both > 10 times ULN and > 2 times baseline, and 1% of \npatients had ALT elevations > 2 times baseline together with total bilirubin > 2 times ULN and > 2 \ntimes baseline. Albumin levels < 2.5 g/dl occurred in 30% of patients, lipase levels > 3 times baseline \nin 10% and platelets < 50,000/mm3 in 20%. \n \nExperience in patients co-infected with HIV: the safety profile of entecavir in a limited number of \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients on lamivudine-containing HAART (highly active antiretroviral \ntherapy) regimens was similar to the safety profile in monoinfected HBV patients (see section 4.4). \n \nGender/age: there was no apparent difference in the safety profile of entecavir with respect to gender \n(≈ 25% women in the clinical trials) or age (≈ 5% of patients > 65 years of age). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions: Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of \nthe medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the \nmedicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the \nnational reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of entecavir overdose reported in patients. Healthy subjects who received \nup to 20 mg/day for up to 14 days, and single doses up to 40 mg had no unexpected adverse reactions. \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nIf overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity and given standard \nsupportive treatment as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse  \ntranscriptase inhibitors \nATC code: J05AF10 \n \nMechanism of action: entecavir, a guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV \npolymerase, is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate (TP) form, which has an \nintracellular half-life of 15 hours. By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine TP, \nentecavir-TP functionally inhibits the 3 activities of the viral polymerase: (1) priming of the HBV \npolymerase, (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand DNA from the pregenomic messenger \nRNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand HBV DNA. The entecavir-TP Ki for HBV DNA \npolymerase is 0.0012 μM. Entecavir-TP is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and δ \nwith Ki values of 18 to 40 µM. In addition, high exposures of entecavir had no relevant adverse effects \non γ polymerase or mitochondrial DNA synthesis in HepG2 cells (Ki > 160 µM). \n \nAntiviral activity: entecavir inhibited HBV DNA synthesis (50% reduction, EC50) at a concentration \nof 0.004 µM in human HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type HBV. The median EC50 value for \nentecavir against LVDr HBV (rtL180M and rtM204V) was 0.026 µM (range 0.010-0.059 µM). \nRecombinant viruses encoding adefovir-resistant substitutions at either rtN236T or rtA181V remained \nfully susceptible to entecavir. \n \nAn analysis of the inhibitory activity of entecavir against a panel of laboratory and clinical HIV-1 \nisolates using a variety of cells and assay conditions yielded EC50 values ranging from 0.026 to \n> 10 µM; the lower EC50 values were observed when decreased levels of virus were used in the assay. \nIn cell culture, entecavir selected for an M184I substitution at micromolar concentrations, confirming \ninhibitory pressure at high entecavir concentrations. HIV variants containing the M184V substitution \nshowed loss of susceptibility to entecavir (see section 4.4). \n \nIn HBV combination assays in cell culture, abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir or \nzidovudine were not antagonistic to the anti-HBV activity of entecavir over a wide range of \nconcentrations. In HIV antiviral assays, entecavir at micromolar concentrations was not antagonistic to \nthe anti-HIV activity in cell culture of these six NRTIs or emtricitabine.  \n \nResistance in cell culture: relative to wild-type HBV, LVDr viruses containing rtM204V and \nrtL180M substitutions within the reverse transcriptase exhibit 8-fold decreased susceptibility to \nentecavir. Incorporation of additional ETVr amino acid changes rtT184, rtS202 or rtM250 decreases \nentecavir susceptibility in cell culture. Substitutions observed in clinical isolates (rtT184A, C, F, G, I, \nL, M or S; rtS202 C, G or I; and/or rtM250I, L or V) further decreased entecavir susceptibility 16- to \n741-fold relative to wild-type virus. Lamivudine-resistant strains harboring rtL180M plus rtM204V in \ncombination with amino acid substitution rtA181C conferred 16- to 122-fold reductions in entecavir \nphenotypic susceptibility.  The ETVr substitutions at residues rtT184, rtS202 and rtM250 alone have \nonly a modest effect on entecavir susceptibility, and have not been observed in the absence of LVDr \nsubstitutions in more than 1000 patient samples sequenced. Resistance is mediated by reduced \ninhibitor binding to the altered HBV reverse transcriptase, and resistant HBV exhibits reduced \nreplication capacity in cell culture. \n \nClinical experience: the demonstration of benefit is based on histological, virological, biochemical, \nand serological responses after 48 weeks of treatment in active-controlled clinical trials of 1,633 adults \nwith chronic hepatitis B infection, evidence of viral replication and compensated liver disease. The \nsafety and efficacy of entecavir were also evaluated in an active-controlled clinical trial of 191 HBV-\n\n\n\n 11 \n\ninfected patients with decompensated liver disease and in a clinical trial of 68 patients co-infected with \nHBV and HIV. \n \nIn studies in patients with compensated liver disease, histological improvement was defined as a ≥ 2-\npoint decrease in Knodell necro-inflammatory score from baseline with no worsening of the Knodell \nfibrosis score. Responses for patients with baseline Knodell Fibrosis Scores of 4 (cirrhosis) were \ncomparable to overall responses on all efficacy outcome measures (all patients had compensated liver \ndisease). High baseline Knodell necroinflammatory scores (> 10) were associated with greater \nhistological improvement in nucleoside-naive patients. Baseline ALT levels ≥ 2 times ULN and \nbaseline HBV DNA ≤ 9.0 log10 copies/ml were both associated with higher rates of virologic response \n(Week 48 HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml) in nucleoside-naive HBeAg-positive patients. Regardless of \nbaseline characteristics, the majority of patients showed histological and virological responses to \ntreatment. \n \nExperience in nucleoside-naive patients with compensated liver disease: \nResults at 48 weeks of randomised, double blind studies comparing entecavir (ETV) to lamivudine \n(LVD) in HBeAg positive (022) and HBeAg negative (027) patients are presented in the table. \n \n Nucleoside Naive \n\nHBeAg Positive \n(study 022) \n\nHBeAg Negative \n(study 027) \n\nETV \n0.5 mg \n\nonce daily \n\nLVD \n100 mg \n\nonce daily \n\nETV \n0.5 mg \n\nonce daily \n\nLVD \n100 mg \n\nonce daily \nn 314a 314a 296a 287a \n\nHistological improvementb 72%* 62% 70%* 61% \nIshak fibrosis score improvement 39% 35% 36% 38% \nIshak fibrosis score worsening 8% 10% 12% 15% \nn 354 355 325 313 \nViral load reduction (log10 copies/ml)c -6.86* -5.39 -5.04* -4.53 \nHBV DNA undetectable \n(< 300 copies/ml by PCR)c \n\n67%* 36% 90%* 72% \n\nALT normalisation (≤ 1 times ULN) 68%* 60% 78%* 71% \n     \nHBeAg Seroconversion 21% 18%   \n*p value vs lamivudine < 0.05 \na patients with evaluable baseline histology (baseline Knodell Necroinflammatory Score ≥ 2) \nb a primary endpoint \nc Roche Cobas Amplicor PCR assay (LLOQ = 300 copies/ml) \n\n \nExperience in lamivudine-refractory patients with compensated liver disease: \nIn a randomised, double-blind study in HBeAg positive lamivudine-refractory patients (026), with \n85% of patients presenting LVDr mutations at baseline, patients receiving lamivudine at study entry \neither switched to entecavir 1 mg once daily, with neither a washout nor an overlap period (n = 141), \nor continued on lamivudine 100 mg once daily (n = 145).

Response criteria were HBV virological suppression (HBV DNA \n< 0.7 MEq/ml by bDNA) and loss of HBeAg (in HBeAg positive patients) or ALT < 1.25 times ULN \n(in HBeAg negative patients). Patients in response were followed for an additional 24 weeks off-\ntreatment. Patients who met virologic but not serologic or biochemical response criteria continued \nblinded treatment. Patients who did not have a virologic response were offered alternative treatment. \n \nNucleoside-naive: \nHBeAg positive (study 022): treatment with entecavir for up to 96 weeks (n = 354) resulted in \ncumulative response rates of 80% for HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml by PCR, 87% for ALT \nnormalisation, 31% for HBeAg seroconversion and 2% for HBsAg seroconversion (5% for HBsAg \nloss). For lamivudine (n = 355), cumulative response rates were 39% for HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml \nby PCR, 79% for ALT normalisation, 26% for HBeAg seroconversion, and 2% for HBsAg \nseroconversion (3% for HBsAg loss). \nAt end of dosing, among patients who continued treatment beyond 52 weeks (median of 96 weeks), \n81% of 243 entecavir-treated and 39% of 164 lamivudine-treated patients had HBV DNA \n< 300 copies/ml by PCR while ALT normalisation (≤ 1 times ULN) occurred in 79% of entecavir-\ntreated and 68% of lamivudine-treated patients. \n \nHBeAg negative (study 027): treatment with entecavir up to 96 weeks (n = 325) resulted in cumulative \nresponse rates of 94% for HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml by PCR and 89% for ALT normalisation versus \n77% for HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml by PCR and 84% for ALT normalisation for lamivudine-treated \npatients (n = 313). \nFor 26 entecavir-treated and 28 lamivudine-treated patients who continued treatment beyond 52 weeks \n(median 96 weeks), 96% of entecavir-treated and 64% of lamivudine-treated patients had HBV DNA \n< 300 copies/ml by PCR at end of dosing. ALT normalisation (≤ 1 times ULN) occurred in 27% of \nentecavir-treated and 21% of lamivudine-treated patients at end of dosing. \n \nFor patients who met protocol-defined response criteria, response was sustained throughout the 24-\nweek post-treatment follow-up in 75% (83/111) of entecavir responders vs 73% (68/93) for \nlamivudine responders in study 022 and 46% (131/286) of entecavir responders vs 31% (79/253) for \nlamivudine responders in study 027. By 48 weeks of post-treatment follow-up, a substantial number of \nHBeAg negative patients lost response. \n \nLiver biopsy results: 57 patients from the pivotal nucleoside-naive studies 022 (HBeAg positive) and \n027 (HBeAg negative) who enrolled in a long-term rollover study were evaluated for long-term liver \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nhistology outcomes. The entecavir dosage was 0.5 mg daily in the pivotal studies (mean exposure 85 \nweeks) and 1 mg daily in the rollover study (mean exposure 177 weeks), and 51 patients in the \nrollover study initially also received lamivudine (median duration 29 weeks). Of these patients, 55/57 \n(96%) had histological improvement as previously defined (see above), and 50/57 (88%) had a ≥ 1-\npoint decrease in Ishak fibrosis score. For patients with baseline Ishak fibrosis score ≥ 2, 25/43 (58%) \nhad a ≥ 2-point decrease. All (10/10) patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline (Ishak \nfibrosis score of 4, 5 or 6) had a ≥ 1 point decrease (median decrease from baseline was 1.5 points). At \nthe time of the long-term biopsy, all patients had HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml and 49/57 (86%) had \nserum ALT ≤ 1 times ULN. All 57 patients remained positive for HBsAg. \n \nLamivudine-refractory: \nHBeAg positive (study 026): treatment with entecavir for up to 96 weeks (n = 141) resulted in \ncumulative response rates of 30% for HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml by PCR, 85% for ALT \nnormalisation and 17% for HBeAg seroconversion. \nFor the 77 patients who continued entecavir treatment beyond 52 weeks (median 96 weeks), 40% of \npatients had HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml by PCR and 81% had ALT normalisation (≤ 1 times ULN) at \nend of dosing. \n \nAge/gender: \nThere was no apparent difference in efficacy for entecavir based on gender (≈ 25% women in the \nclinical trials) or age (≈ 5% of patients > 65 years of age). \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with decompensated liver disease: in study 048, 191 patients with HBeAg positive or \nnegative chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a CTP score of 7 \nor higher, received entecavir 1 mg once daily or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily. Patients were \neither HBV-treatment-naïve or pretreated (excluding pretreatment with entecavir, adefovir dipivoxil, \nor tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). At baseline, patients had a mean CTP score of 8.59 and 26% of \npatients were CTP class C. The mean baseline Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was \n16.23. Mean serum HBV DNA by PCR was 7.83 log10 copies/ml and mean serum ALT was 100 U/l; \n54% of patients were HBeAg positive, and 35% of patients had LVDr substitutions at baseline. \nEntecavir was superior to adefovir dipivoxil on the primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from \nbaseline in serum HBV DNA by PCR at week 24.

Patients had stable controlled HIV (HIV RNA \n< 400 copies/ml) with recurrence of HBV viraemia on a lamivudine-containing HAART regimen. \nHAART regimens did not include emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. At baseline \nentecavir-treated patients had a median duration of prior lamivudine therapy of 4.8 years and median \nCD4 count of 494 cells/mm3 (with only 5 subjects having CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3). Patients \ncontinued their lamivudine-regimen and were assigned to add either entecavir 1 mg once daily \n(n = 51) or placebo (n = 17) for 24 weeks followed by an additional 24 weeks where all received \nentecavir. At 24 weeks the reduction in HBV viral load was significantly greater with entecavir (-3.65 \nvs an increase of 0.11 log10 copies/ml). For patients originally assigned to entecavir treatment, the \nreduction in HBV DNA at 48 weeks was -4.20 log10 copies/ml, ALT normalisation had occurred in \n37% of patients with abnormal baseline ALT and none achieved HBeAg seroconversion.  \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients not receiving concomitant HAART: entecavir has not been evaluated in \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients not concurrently receiving effective HIV treatment. Reductions in HIV \nRNA have been reported in HIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving entecavir monotherapy without \nHAART. In some cases, selection of HIV variant M184V has been observed, which has implications \nfor the selection of HAART regimens that the patient may take in the future. Therefore, entecavir \nshould not be used in this setting due to the potential for development of HIV resistance (see section \n4.4). \n \nLiver transplant recipients: the safety and efficacy of entecavir 1 mg once daily were assessed in a \nsingle-arm study in 65 patients who received a liver transplant for complications of chronic HBV \ninfection and had HBV DNA <172 IU/ml (approximately 1000 copies/ml) at the time of transplant. \nThe study population was 82% male, 39% Caucasian, and 37% Asian, with a mean age of 49 years; \n89% of patients had HBeAg-negative disease at the time of transplant. Of the 61 patients who were \nevaluable for efficacy (received entecavir for at least 1 month), 60 also received hepatitis B immune \nglobulin (HBIg) as part of the post-transplant prophylaxis regimen. Of these 60 patients, 49 received \nmore than 6 months of HBIg therapy. At Week 72 post-transplant, none of 55 observed cases had \nvirologic recurrence of HBV [defined as HBV DNA ≥50 IU/ml (approximately 300 copies/ml)], and \nthere was no reported virologic recurrence at time of censoring for the remaining 6 patients. All 61 \npatients had HBsAg loss post-transplantation, and 2 of these later became HBsAg positive despite \nmaintaining undetectable HBV DNA (<6 IU/ml). The frequency and nature of adverse events in this \nstudy were consistent with those expected in patients who have received a liver transplant and the \nknown safety profile of entecavir. \n \nPaediatric population: Study 189 is an ongoing study of the efficacy and safety of entecavir among \n180 nucleoside-treatment-naïve children and adolescents from 2 to < 18 years of age with HBeAg-\npositive chronic hepatitis B infection, compensated liver disease, and elevated ALT. Subjects were \nrandomized (2:1) to receive blinded treatment with entecavir 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg/day (N = 120) \nor placebo (N = 60). The randomization was stratified by age group (2 to 6 years; > 6 to 12 years; and \n> 12 to < 18 years). Baseline demographics and HBV disease characteristics were comparable \nbetween the 2 treatment arms and across age cohorts. At study entry, the mean HBV DNA was \n8.1 log10 IU/ml and mean ALT was 103 U/l across the study population.

The \ntwo trials provide resistance data in 183 patients treated and monitored in Year 1 and 180 patients  \ntreated and monitored in Year 2. Genotypic evaluations were performed for all patients with available \nsamples who had virologic breakthrough through Week 96  or HBV DNA ≥ 50 IU/ml at Week 48 or \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nWeek 96 . During Year 2, genotypic resistance to ETV was detected in 2 patients (1.1% cumulative \nprobability of resistance through Year 2). \n \nClinical resistance in Adults: patients in clinical trials initially treated with entecavir 0.5 mg \n(nucleoside-naive) or 1.0 mg (lamivudine-refractory) and with an on-therapy PCR HBV DNA \nmeasurement at or after Week 24 were monitored for resistance. \nThrough Week 240 in nucleoside-naive studies, genotypic evidence of ETVr substitutions at rtT184, \nrtS202, or rtM250 was identified in 3 patients treated with entecavir, 2 of whom experienced virologic \nbreakthrough (see table). These substitutions were observed only in the presence of LVDr \nsubstitutions (rtM204V and rtL180M). \n \nEmerging Genotypic Entecavir Resistance Through Year 5, Nucleoside-Naive Studies \n\n Year 1 Year 2 Year 3a Year 4a Year 5a \n\nPatients treated and monitored for \nresistanceb \n\n663 278 149 121 108 \n\nPatients in specific year with:      \n - emerging genotypic ETVrc  1  1  1  0 0 \n\n - genotypic ETVrc with virologic \nbreakthroughd \n\n1  0 1 0 0 \n\nCumulative probability of:      \n\n- emerging genotypic ETVrc 0.2% 0.5% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% \n\n - genotypic ETVrc with virologic \nbreakthroughd  \n\n0.2% 0.2% 0.8% 0.8% 0.8% \n\na Results reflect use of a 1-mg dose of entecavir for 147 of 149 patients in Year 3 and all patients in Years 4 and 5 \nand of combination entecavir-lamivudine therapy (followed by long-term entecavir therapy) for a median of 20 \nweeks for 130 of 149 patients in Year 3 and for 1 week for 1 of 121 patients in Year 4 in a rollover study.  \n\nb Includes patients with at least one on-therapy HBV DNA measurement by PCR at or after week 24 through week 58 \n(Year 1), after week 58 through week 102 (Year 2), after week 102 through week 156 (Year 3), after week 156 \nthrough week 204 (Year 4), or after week 204 through week 252 (Year 5). \n\nc Patients also have LVDr substitutions. \nd ≥ 1 log10 increase above nadir in HBV DNA by PCR, confirmed with successive measurements or at the end of the \n\nwindowed time point. \n \nETVr substitutions (in addition to LVDr substitutions rtM204V/I ± rtL180M) were observed at \nbaseline in isolates from 10/187 (5%) lamivudine-refractory patients treated with entecavir and \nmonitored for resistance, indicating that prior lamivudine treatment can select these resistance \nsubstitutions and that they can exist at a low frequency before entecavir treatment. Through Week 240, \n3 of the 10 patients experienced virologic breakthrough (≥ 1 log10 increase above nadir).

These 14 patients had a lower rate of genotypic \nentecavir resistance (cumulative probability 18.8% through 5 years of follow-up) than the overall \nstudy population (see table). Also, lamivudine-refractory patients who achieved HBV DNA < 104 log10 \ncopies/ml by PCR at Week 24 had a lower rate of resistance than those who did not (5-year cumulative \nprobability 17.6% [n= 50] versus 60.5% [n= 135], respectively). \n \nIntegrated Analysis of Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Studies: In a post-approval integrated analysis of \nentecavir resistance data from 17 Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, an emergent entecavir resistance-\nassociated substitution rtA181C was detected in 5 out of 1461 subjects during treatment with \nentecavir. This substitution was detected only in the presence of lamivudine resistance-associated \nsubstitutions rtL180M plus rtM204V. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: entecavir is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5-\n1.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability has not been determined. Based on urinary excretion of \nunchanged drug, the bioavailability has been estimated to be at least 70%. There is a dose-\nproportionate increase in Cmax and AUC values following multiple doses ranging from 0.1-1 mg. \nSteady-state is achieved between 6-10 days after once daily dosing with ≈ 2 times accumulation. Cmax \nand Cmin at steady-state are 4.2 and 0.3 ng/ml, respectively, for a dose of 0.5 mg, and 8.2 and \n0.5 ng/ml, respectively, for 1 mg. The tablet and oral solution were bioequivalent in healthy subjects; \ntherefore, both forms may be used interchangeably. \n \nAdministration of 0.5 mg entecavir with a standard high-fat meal (945 kcal, 54.6 g fat) or a light meal \n(379 kcal, 8.2 g fat) resulted in a minimal delay in absorption (1-1.5 hour fed vs. 0.75 hour fasted), a \ndecrease in Cmax of 44-46%, and a decrease in AUC of 18-20%. The lower Cmax and AUC when taken \nwith food is not considered to be of clinical relevance in nucleoside-naive patients but could affect \nefficacy in lamivudine-refractory patients (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n \nDistribution: the estimated volume of distribution for entecavir is in excess of total body water. \nProtein binding to human serum protein in vitro is ≈ 13%. \n \nBiotransformation: entecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the CYP450 enzyme system. \nFollowing administration of 14C-entecavir, no oxidative or acetylated metabolites and minor amounts \nof the phase II metabolites, glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, were observed. \n \nElimination: entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney with urinary recovery of unchanged \ndrug at steady-state of about 75% of the dose. Renal clearance is independent of dose and ranges \nbetween 360-471 ml/min suggesting that entecavir undergoes both glomerular filtration and net \ntubular secretion. After reaching peak levels, entecavir plasma concentrations decreased in a bi-\nexponential manner with a terminal elimination half-life of ≈ 128-149 hours. The observed drug \naccumulation index is ≈ 2 times with once daily dosing, suggesting an effective accumulation half-life \nof about 24 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment: pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nRenal impairment: entecavir clearance decreases with decreasing creatinine clearance. A 4 hour period \nof haemodialysis removed ≈ 13% of the dose, and 0.3% was removed by CAPD. The \npharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1 mg dose in patients (without chronic hepatitis B \ninfection) are shown in the table below: \n \n Baseline Creatinine Clearance (ml/min)   \n\nUnimpaired \n> 80 \n\n \n \n\n(n = 6) \n\nMild \n> 50; \n≤ 80 \n\n \n(n = 6) \n\nModerate \n30-50 \n\n \n \n\n(n = 6) \n\nSevere \n20-\n< 30 \n\n \n(n = 6) \n\nSevere \nManaged with \nHaemodialysis \n\n \n(n = 6) \n\nSevere \nManaged \n\nwith CAPD \n \n\n(n = 4) \nCmax (ng/ml) \n(CV%) \n\n8.1 \n(30.7) \n\n \n\n10.4 \n(37.2) \n\n10.5 \n(22.7) \n\n15.3 \n(33.8) \n\n15.4 \n(56.4) \n\n16.6 \n(29.7) \n\nAUC(0-T) \n(ng·h /ml) \n(CV) \n\n27.9 \n \n\n(25.6) \n \n\n51.5 \n \n\n(22.8) \n\n69.5 \n \n\n(22.7) \n\n145.7 \n \n\n(31.5) \n\n233.9 \n \n\n(28.4) \n\n221.8 \n \n\n(11.6) \n\nCLR (ml/min) \n(SD) \n\n383.2 \n(101.8) \n\n \n\n197.9 \n(78.1) \n\n135.6 \n(31.6) \n\n40.3 \n(10.1) \n\nNA NA \n\nCLT/F (ml/min) \n(SD) \n\n588.1 \n(153.7) \n\n309.2 \n(62.6) \n\n226.3 \n(60.1) \n\n100.6 \n(29.1) \n\n50.6 \n(16.5) \n\n35.7 \n(19.6) \n\n \nPost-Liver transplant: entecavir exposure in HBV-infected liver transplant recipients on a stable dose \nof cyclosporine A or tacrolimus (n = 9) was ≈ 2 times the exposure in healthy subjects with normal \nrenal function. Altered renal function contributed to the increase in entecavir exposure in these patients \n(see section 4.4). \n \nGender: AUC was 14% higher in women than in men, due to differences in renal function and weight. \nAfter adjusting for differences in creatinine clearance and body weight there was no difference in \nexposure between male and female subjects. \n \nElderly: the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir was evaluated comparing elderly \nsubjects in the age range 65-83 years (mean age females 69 years, males 74 years) with young subjects \nin the age range 20-40 years (mean age females 29 years, males 25 years). AUC was 29% higher in \nelderly than in young subjects, mainly due to differences in renal function and weight. After adjusting \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nfor differences in creatinine clearance and body weight, elderly subjects had a 12.5% higher AUC than \nyoung subjects.The population pharmacokinetic analysis covering patients in the age range 16-\n75 years did not identify age as significantly influencing entecavir pharmacokinetics. \n \nRace: the population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify race as significantly influencing \nentecavir pharmacokinetics. However, conclusions can only be drawn for the Caucasian and Asian \ngroups as there were too few subjects in the other categories. \n \nPaediatric population: the steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir were evaluated (study 028) in \n24 nucleoside naïve and 19 lamivudine-experienced HBeAg-positive paediatric subjects from \n2 to < 18 years of age with compensated liver disease. Entecavir exposure among nucleoside naïve \nsubjects receiving once daily doses of entecavir 0.015 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 0.5 mg was \nsimilar to the exposure achieved in adults receiving once daily doses of 0.5 mg. The Cmax, AUC(0-\n24), and Cmin for these subjects was 6.31 ng/ml, 18.33 ng h/ml, and 0.28 ng/ml, respectively. \nEntecavir exposure among lamivudine-experienced subjects receiving once daily doses of entecavir \n0.030 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg was similar to the exposure achieved in adults receiving \nonce daily doses of 1.0 mg. The Cmax, AUC(0-24), and Cmin for these subjects was 14.48 ng/ml, \n38.58 ng∙h/ml, and 0.47 ng/ml, respectively. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicology studies in dogs, reversible perivascular inflammation was observed in the \ncentral nervous system, for which no-effect doses corresponded to exposures 19 and 10 times those in \nhumans (at 0.5 and 1 mg respectively). This finding was not observed in repeat-dose studies in other \nspecies, including monkeys administered entecavir daily for 1 year at exposures ≥ 100 times those in \nhumans. \n \nIn reproductive toxicology studies in which animals were administered entecavir for up to 4 weeks, no \nevidence of impaired fertility was seen in male or female rats at high exposures. Testicular changes \n(seminiferous tubular degeneration) were evident in repeat-dose toxicology studies in rodents and dogs \nat exposures ≥ 26 times those in humans. No testicular changes were evident in a 1-year study in \nmonkeys. \n \nIn pregnant rats and rabbits administered entecavir, no effect levels for embryotoxicity and maternal \ntoxicity corresponded to exposures ≥ 21 times those in humans. In rats, maternal toxicity, embryo-\nfoetal toxicity (resorptions), lower foetal body weights, tail and vertebral malformations, reduced \nossification (vertebrae, sternebrae, and phalanges), and extra lumbar vertebrae and ribs were observed \nat high exposures. In rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity (resorptions), reduced ossification (hyoid), and an \nincreased incidence of 13th rib were observed at high exposures. In a peri-postnatal study in rats, no \nadverse effects on offspring were observed. In a separate study wherein entecavir was administered to \npregnant lactating rats at 10 mg/kg, both foetal exposure to entecavir and secretion of entecavir into \nmilk were demonstrated. In juvenile rats administered entecavir from postnatal days 4 to 80, a \nmoderately reduced acoustic startle response was noted during the recovery period (postnatal days \n110 to 114) but not during the dosing period at AUC values ≥ 92 times those in humans at the 0.5 mg \ndose or paediatric equivalent dose. Given the exposure margin, this finding is considered of unlikely \nclinical significance. \n \nNo evidence of genotoxicity was observed in an Ames microbial mutagenicity assay, a mammalian-\ncell gene mutation assay, and a transformation assay with Syrian hamster embryo cells. A \nmicronucleus study and a DNA repair study in rats were also negative. Entecavir was clastogenic to \nhuman lymphocyte cultures at concentrations substantially higher than those achieved clinically. \n \nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies: in male mice, increases in the incidences of lung tumours were \nobserved at exposures ≥ 4 and ≥ 2 times that in humans at 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively. Tumour \ndevelopment was preceded by pneumocyte proliferation in the lung which was not observed in rats, \ndogs, or monkeys, indicating that a key event in lung tumour development observed in mice likely was \nspecies-specific. Increased incidences of other tumours including brain gliomas in male and female \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nrats, liver carcinomas in male mice, benign vascular tumours in female mice, and liver adenomas and \ncarcinomas in female rats were seen only at high lifetime exposures. However, the no effect levels \ncould not be precisely established. The predictivity of the findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Entecavir Accord is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Entecavir Accord \n3. How to take Entecavir Accord \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Entecavir Accord \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Entecavir Accord is and what it is used for \n \nEntecavir Accord tablets are anti-viral medicines, used to treat chronic (long term) hepatitis B \nvirus (HBV) infection in adults. Entecavir Accord can be used in people whose liver is damaged but \nstill functions properly (compensated liver disease) and in people whose liver is damaged and does not \nfunction properly (decompensated liver disease). \n \nEntecavir Accord tablets are also used to treat chronic (long term) HBV infection in children \nand adolescents aged 2 years to less than 18 years. Entecavir Accord can be used in children whose \nliver is damaged but still functions properly (compensated liver disease). \n \nInfection by the hepatitis B virus can lead to damage to the liver. Entecavir Accord reduces the amount \nof virus in your body, and improves the condition of the liver. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Entecavir Accord \n \nDo not take Entecavir Accord \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to entecavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \nWarning and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Entecavir Accord \n if you have ever had problems with your kidneys, tell your doctor. This is important because \n\nEntecavir Accord is eliminated from your body through the kidneys and your dose or dosing \nschedule may need to be adjusted. \n\n \n do not stop taking Entecavir Accord without your doctor’s advice since your hepatitis may \n\nworsen after stopping treatment. When your treatment with Entecavir Accord is stopped, your \ndoctor will continue to monitor you and take blood tests for several months. \n\n \n discuss with your doctor whether your liver functions properly and, if not, what the possible \n\neffects on your Entecavir Accord treatment may be. \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n \n if you are also infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) be sure to tell your doctor. \n\nYou should not take Entecavir Accord to treat your hepatitis B infection unless you are taking \nmedicines for HIV at the same time, as the effectiveness of future HIV treatment may be \nreduced. Entecavir Accord will not control your HIV infection. \n\n \n taking Entecavir Accord will not stop you from infecting other people with hepatitis B \n\nvirus (HBV) through sexual contact or body fluids (including blood contamination). So, it is \nimportant to take appropriate precautions to prevent others from becoming infected with HBV. \nA vaccine is available to protect those at risk from becoming infected with HBV. \n\n \n Entecavir Accord belongs to a class of medicines that can cause lactic acidosis (excess of \n\nlactic acid in your blood) and enlargement of the liver. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and \nstomach pain might indicate the development of lactic acidosis. This rare but serious side effect \nhas occasionally been fatal. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are \nvery overweight. Your doctor will monitor you regularly while you are receiving Entecavir \nAccord. \n\n \n if you have previously received treatment for chronic hepatitis B, please inform your doctor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nEntecavir Accord should not be used for children below 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg. \n \nOther medicines and Entecavir Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nEntecavir Accord with food and drink \nIn most cases you may take Entecavir Accord with or without food. However, if you have had a \nprevious treatment with a medicine containing the active substance lamivudine you should consider \nthe following. If you were switched over to Entecavir Accord because the treatment with lamivudine \nwas not successful, you should take Entecavir Accord on an empty stomach once daily. If your liver \ndisease is very advanced, your doctor will also instruct you to take Entecavir Accord on an empty \nstomach. Empty stomach means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next \nmeal. \nChildren and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age) can take Entecavir Accord with or \nwithout food. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It has not been demonstrated that \nEntecavir Accord is safe to use during pregnancy. Entecavir Accord must not be used during \npregnancy unless specifically directed by your doctor. It is important that women of childbearing age \nreceiving treatment with Entecavir Accord use an effective method of contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant. \n \nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Entecavir Accord. Tell your doctor if you are breast-\nfeeding. It is not known whether entecavir, the active ingredient in Entecavir Accord, is excreted in \nhuman breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness, tiredness (fatigue) and sleepiness (somnolence) are common side effects which may impair \nyour ability to drive and use machines. If you have any concerns consult your doctor. \n \nEntecavir Accord contains soy polysaccharides \nThis medicinal product contains soy polysaccharides. If you are allergic to soya, do not use this \nmedicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n \n3. How to take Entecavir Accord \n \nNot all patients need to take the same dose of Entecavir Accord. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nFor adults the recommended dose is either 0.5 mg or 1 mg once daily orally (by mouth). \n \nYour dose will depend on: \n whether you have been treated for HBV infection before, and what medicine you received. \n whether you have kidney problems. Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose for you or instruct \n\nyou to take it less often than once a day. \n the condition of your liver. \n \nFor children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age), Entecavir Accord 0.5 mg tablets \nare available or an entecavir oral solution may be available. \nYour child's doctor will decide the right dose based on your child's weight. Children weighing at least \n32.6 kg may take the 0.5 mg tablet or an entecavir oral solution may be available. For patients \nweighing from 10 kg to 32.5 kg, an entecavir oral solution is recommended. All dosing will be taken \nonce daily orally (by mouth). There are no recommendations for entecavir in children less than 2 years \nof age or weighing less than 10 kg. \n \nYour doctor will advise you on the dose that is right for you. Always take the dose recommended by \nyour doctor to ensure that your medicine is fully effective and to reduce the development of resistance \nto treatment. Take Entecavir Accord as long as your doctor has told you. Your doctor will tell you if \nand when you should stop the treatment. \n \nSome patients must take Entecavir Accord on an empty stomach (see Entecavir Accord with food \nand drink in Section 2). If your doctor instructs you to take Entecavir Accord on an empty stomach, \nempty stomach means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next meal. \n \nEntecavir Accord is only available as 0.5 and 1 mg film-coated tablets. For patients who are not able \nto swallow tablets or for whom a dose reduction is recommended, other entecavir-containing products \nwith more suitable formulations may be available. \n \nIf you take more Entecavir Accord than you should \nContact your doctor at once. \n \nIf you forget to take Entecavir Accord \nIt is important that you do not miss any doses. If you miss a dose of Entecavir Accord, take it as soon \nas possible, and then take your next scheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next \ndose, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nDo not stop Entecavir Accord without your doctor’s advice \nSome people get very serious hepatitis symptoms when they stop taking Entecavir Accord. Tell your \ndoctor immediately about any changes in symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
