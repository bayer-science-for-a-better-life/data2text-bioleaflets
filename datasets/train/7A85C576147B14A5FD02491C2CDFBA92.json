NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 1 mg bortezomib (as a mannitol boronic ester). \n\n \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of solution for intravenous injection contains 1 mg bortezomib. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \n \nWhite to off-white lyophilized powder or cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBortezomib as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or \n\ndexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma \n\nwho have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nBortezomib in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult \npatients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose \n\nchemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \nBortezomib in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is \n\nindicated for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma \n\nwho are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \nBortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is \n\nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who \n\nare unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nBortezomib treatment must be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of cancer patients, however bortezomib may be administered by a healthcare professional \n\nexperienced in use of chemotherapeutic agents. Bortezomib must be reconstituted by a healthcare \n\nprofessional (see section 6.6). \n\n \nPosology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one \n\nprior therapy) \n\nMonotherapy \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous \n\ninjection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on \n\ndays 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment \n\ncycle. It is recommended that patients receive 2 cycles of bortezomib following a confirmation of a \ncomplete response. It is also recommended that responding patients who do not achieve a complete \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nremission receive a total of 8 cycles of bortezomib therapy. At least 72 hours should elapse \n\nbetween consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n \n\nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy \n\nBortezomib treatment must be withheld at the onset of any grade 3 non-haematological or any \ngrade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4). \n\nOnce the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, bortezomib treatment may be re-initiated at a \n\n25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2; 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the \n\ntoxicity is not resolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of bortezomib must be \nconsidered unless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk. \n\n \n\nNeuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy \nPatients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to \n\nbe managed as presented in table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy \n\nmay be treated with bortezomib only after careful risk/benefit assessment. \n\n \nTable 1:  Recommended* posology modifications for bortezomib-related neuropathy \n\nSeverity of neuropathy Posology modification \n\nGrade 1 (asymptomatic; loss of deep tendon \n\nreflexes or paresthesia) with no pain or loss of \n\nfunction \n\nNone \n\nGrade 1 with pain or grade 2 (moderate \n\nsymptoms; limiting instrumental Activities of \n\nDaily Living (ADL)**) \n\nReduce bortezomib to 1.0 mg/m2 \n\nor \n\nChange bortezomib treatment schedule to \n\n1.3 mg/m2 once per week. \n\nGrade 2 with pain or grade 3 (severe symptoms; \n\nlimiting self care ADL***) \n\nWithhold bortezomib treatment until symptoms \n\nof toxicity have resolved. When toxicity resolves \n\nre-initiate bortezomib treatment and reduce dose \n\nto 0.7 mg/m2 once per week \n\nGrade 4 (life-threatening consequences; urgent \n\nintervention indicated)  \n\nand/or severe autonomic neuropathy \n\nDiscontinue bortezomib \n\n* Based on posology modifications in Phase II and III multiple myeloma studies and post-marketing \n\nexperience. \n\nGrading based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria CTCAE v 4.0. \n\n** Instrumental ADL: refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using telephone, managing \n\nmoney, etc; \n\n*** Self care ADL: refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medicinal \n\nproducts, and not bedridden. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous \n\ninjection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on \n\ndays 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment \n\ncycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n\n \n\nPegylated liposomal doxorubicin is administered at 30 mg/m2 on day 4 of the bortezomib treatment \n\ncycle as a 1 hour intravenous infusion administered after the bortezomib injection. \n\n \n\nUp to 8 cycles of this combination therapy can be administered as long as patients have not \n\nprogressed and tolerate treatment. Patients achieving a complete response can continue treatment \n\nfor at least 2 cycles after the first evidence of complete response, even if this requires treatment for \n\nmore than 8 cycles. Patients whose levels of paraprotein continue to decrease after 8 cycles can also \n\ncontinue for as long as treatment is tolerated and they continue to respond. \n\nFor additional information concerning pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, see the corresponding \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nSummary of Product Characteristics. \n\nCombination with dexamethasone \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous \n\ninjection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on \n\ndays 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21 day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. \n\nAt least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the \n\nbortezomib treatment cycle. \n\nPatients achieving a response or a stable disease after 4 cycles of this combination therapy can \n\ncontinue to receive the same combination for a maximum of 4 additional cycles. \n\nFor additional information concerning dexamethasone, see the corresponding Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments for combination therapy for patients with progressive multiple myeloma \n\nFor bortezomib dosage adjustments for combination therapy follow dose modification guidelines \n\ndescribed under monotherapy above. \n\n \n\nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients not eligible for haematopoietic stem \n\ncell transplantation \n\nCombination therapy with melphalan and prednisone \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous \n\ninjection in combination with oral melphalan and oral prednisone as shown in table 2. A 6-week \n\nperiod is considered a treatment cycle. In cycles 1-4, bortezomib is administered twice weekly on \n\ndays 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32. In cycles 5-9, bortezomib is administered once weekly on days \n\n1, 8, 22 and 29. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n\nMelphalan and prednisone should both be given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first week of \n\neach bortezomib treatment cycle. \n\nNine treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered. \n\n \n\nTable 2:  Recommended posology for bortezomib in combination with melphalan and \n\nprednisone \n\nTwice weekly bortezomib (cycles 1-4) \n\nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\nB \n(1.3 mg/m2) \n\nDay \n1 \n\n-- -- Day \n4 \n\nDay \n8 \n\nDay \n11 \n\nrest \nperiod \n\nDay \n22 \n\nDay \n25 \n\nDay \n29 \n\nDay \n32 \n\nrest \nperiod \n\nM (9 mg/m2) \nP (60 mg/m2) \n\nDay \n1 \n\nDay \n2 \n\nDay \n3 \n\nDay \n4 \n\n-- -- rest \nperiod \n\n-- -- -- -- rest \nperiod \n\nOnce weekly bortezomib (cycles 5-9) \n\nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\nB \n\n(1.3 mg/m2) \n\nDay \n\n1 \n\n-- -- -- Day \n\n8 \n\nrest \n\nperiod \n\nDay \n\n22 \n\nDay \n\n29 \n\nrest \n\nperiod \n\nM (9 mg/m2) \n\nP (60 mg/m2) \n\nDay \n\n1 \n\nDay \n\n2 \n\nDay \n\n3 \n\nDay \n\n4 \n\n-- rest \n\nperiod \n\n-- \n \n\nrest \n\nperiod \n\nB=bortezomib; M=melphalan, P=prednisone \n\n \nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for combination therapy with \n\nmelphalan and prednisone \n\nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: \n\n\u2022 Platelet counts should be \u2265 70 x 109/l and the absolute neutrophils count should be \n\u2265 1.0 x 109/l \n\n\u2022 Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to grade 1 or baseline \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nTable 3:  Posology modifications during subsequent cycles of bortezomib therapy in \n\n combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nToxicity Posology modification or delay \n\nHaematological toxicity during a cycle \n \n\n\u2022 If prolonged grade 4 neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia with \n\nbleeding is observed in the previous cycle \n\nConsider reduction of the melphalan dose by \n\n25% in the next cycle. \n\n\u2022 If platelet counts \u2264 30 x 109/l or ANC \n\u2264 0.75 x 109/l on a bortezomib dosing day \n\n(other than day 1) \n\nBortezomib therapy should be withheld \n\n\u2022 If several bortezomib doses in a cycle are \nwithheld (\u2265 3 doses during twice weekly \n\nadministration or \u2265 2 doses during weekly \nadministration) \n\nBortezomib dose should be reduced by 1 dose \n\nlevel (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from \n1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2) \n\nGrade \u2265 3 non-haematological toxicities Bortezomib therapy should be withheld until \nsymptoms of the toxicity have resolved to \n\ngrade 1 or baseline. Then, bortezomib may be \n\nreinitiated with one dose level reduction (from \n1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to \n\n0.7 mg/m2). For bortezomib-related neuropathic \n\npain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or \nmodify bortezomib as outlined in table 1. \n\n \nFor additional information concerning melphalan and prednisone, see the corresponding Summary \n\nof Product Characteristics. \n\n \nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients eligible for haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplantation (induction therapy) \n\nCombination therapy with dexamethasone \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous \n\ninjection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on \n\ndays 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment \n\ncycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \nDexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib \n\ntreatment cycle. \n\nFour treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered. \n \n\nCombination therapy with dexamethasone and thalidomide \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via intravenous \ninjection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on \n\ndays 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 28-day treatment cycle. This 4-week period is considered a treatment \n\ncycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib \ntreatment cycle. \n\nThalidomide is administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14 and if tolerated the dose is \n\nincreased to 100 mg on days 15-28, and thereafter may be further increased to 200 mg daily from \ncycle 2 (see table 4). \n\nFour treatment cycles of this combination are administered.

This 3-week period is \n\nconsidered a treatment cycle. Six bortezomib cycles are recommended, although for patients with a \nresponse first documented at cycle 6, two additional bortezomib cycles may be given. At least 72 \n\nhours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n\n \nThe following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each bortezomib 3 week treatment \n\ncycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and \n\ndoxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. \nPrednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each bortezomib \n\ntreatment cycle. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma \nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: \n\n- Platelet counts should be \u2265 100,000 cells/\u03bcL and the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) should \nbe \u2265 1,500 cells/\u03bcL \n\n- Platelet counts should be \u2265 75,000 cells/\u03bcL in patients with bone marrow infiltration or splenic \nsequestration \n\n- Haemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL \n- Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to grade 1 or baseline. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nBortezomib treatment must be withheld at the onset of any \u2265 grade 3 bortezomib -related \n\nnon-haematological toxicities (excluding neuropathy) or \u2265 grade 3 haematological toxicities (see \nalso section 4.4). For dose adjustments, see table 5 below. \n\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to \n\nlocal standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be \nconsidered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration. Platelet transfusion for the treatment \n\nof thrombocytopenia should be considered when clinically appropriate. \n\n \n\nTable 5:  Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell \n  lymphoma \n\nToxicity Posology modification or delay \n\nHaematological toxicity \n\n- \u2265 Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, grade 4 \nneutropenia lasting more than 7 days, a \nplatelet count < 10,000 cells/\u03bcL \n\nBortezomib therapy should be withheld for up to \n\n2 weeks until the patient has an ANC \n\u2265 750 cells/\u03bcL and a platelet count \n\n\u2265 25,000 cells/\u03bcL. \n\n- If, after bortezomib has been held, the \ntoxicity does not resolve, as defined above, \n\nthen bortezomib must be discontinued. \n\n- If toxicity resolves i.e. patient has an ANC \n\u2265 750 cells/\u03bcL and a platelet count \n\u2265 25,000 cells/\u03bcL, bortezomib may be \n\nreinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose \n\nlevel (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from \n1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). \n\n- If platelet counts < 25,000 cells/\u03bcL. or ANC \n< 750 cells/\u03bcL on a bortezomib dosing day \n\n(other than Day 1 of each cycle) \n\nBortezomib therapy should be withheld \n\nGrade \u2265 3 non-haematological toxicities \n\nconsidered to be related to bortezomib  \n\nBortezomib therapy should be withheld until \n\nsymptoms of the toxicity have resolved to \n\ngrade 2 or better. Then, bortezomib may be \nreinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level \n\n(from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to \n\n0.7 mg/m2). For bortezomib-related neuropathic \n\npain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or \nmodify bortezomib as outlined in table 1. \n\n \n\nIn addition, when bortezomib is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal \n\nproducts, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the \nevent of toxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age \nwith multiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma. \n\nThere are no studies on the use of bortezomib in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple \n\nmyeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplantation. Therefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population. \n\nIn a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients \n\nexposed to bortezomib were in the range 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years of age, respectively. In \n\npatients aged \u2265 75 years, both regimens, BR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per \nthe recommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on \n\nbortezomib at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a \n\nsubsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered \nbased on patient tolerability (see table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nTable 6:  Recommended starting dose modification for bortezomib in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment \n\nGrade of hepatic \n\nimpairment* \nBilirubin level SGOT (AST) \n\nlevels \nModification of starting \n\ndose \n\nMild \u2264 1.0 x ULN > ULN None \n\n> 1.0 x \u22121.5 x ULN Any None \n\nModerate > 1.5 x \u22123 x ULN Any Reduce bortezomib to \n\n0.7 mg/m2 in the first \n\ntreatment cycle.

It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced \nin patients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\nSince dialysis may reduce bortezomib concentrations, bortezomib should be administered after the \n\ndialysis procedure (see section 5.2). \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of bortezomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established \n\n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous \n\nadministration only.  \n \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or \n\nsubcutaneous administration. \n\n \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or \n\nsubcutaneous administration. \n\n \nBortezomib should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death. \n\n \n\nIntravenous injection \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is for intravenous administration \nonly. The reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection through \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\na peripheral or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n\n(0.9%) solution for injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of \nbortezomib. \n\n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nAcute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease. \n\n \nWhen bortezomib is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their Summaries \n\nof Product Characteristics for additional contraindications. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment \nwith bortezomib. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and \n\nprevention requirements is needed (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nIntrathecal administration \n\nThere have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of bortezomib. Bortezomib \n\nFresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is for intravenous use only, while \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is for intravenous or \nsubcutaneous use. Bortezomib should not be administered intrathecally. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal toxicity \nGastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common \n\nwith bortezomib treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). \n\nTherefore, patients who experience constipation should be closely monitored. \n \n\nHaematological toxicity \n\nBortezomib treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities \n\n(thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia). In studies in patients with relapsed multiple \nmyeloma treated with bortezomib and in patients with previously untreated MCL treated with \n\nbortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone \n\n(BR-CAP), one of the most common haematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. \nPlatelets were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of bortezomib treatment and typically recovered to \n\nbaseline by the next cycle. There was no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia. The mean \n\nplatelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of baseline in the single-agent multiple \nmyeloma studies and 50% in the MCL study. In patients with advanced myeloma the severity of \n\nthrombocytopenia was related to pre-treatment platelet count: for baseline platelet counts \n\n< 75,000/\u03bcl, 90% of 21 patients had a count \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study, including 14% \n\n< 10,000/\u03bcl; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count > 75,000/\u03bcl, only 14% of 309 patients had a \ncount \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study. \n\n \n\nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of \ngrade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia in the bortezomib treatment group (BR-CAP) as compared to the \n\nnon-bortezomib treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and \n\nprednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence \n\nof all-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the BR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well \nas grade 3 and higher bleeding events (BR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In \n\nthe BR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients \n\nin the R-CHOP group. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with bortezomib \n\ntreatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of bortezomib. \nBortezomib therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/\u03bcl or, in the case of \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone, when the platelet count is \u2264 30,000/\u03bcl (see \n\nsection 4.2). Potential benefit of the treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, \nparticularly in case of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding. \n\n \n\nComplete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently \n\nmonitored throughout treatment with bortezomib. Platelet transfusion should be considered when \nclinically appropriate (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with \nno evidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of \n\nbortezomib treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, \n\ncolony stimulating factor support was given to 78% of patients in the BR-CAP arm and 61% of \n\npatients in the R-CHOP arm. Since patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, \nthey should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte \n\ncolony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local \n\nstandard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered \nin case of repeated delays in cycle administration (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHerpes zoster virus reactivation \nAntiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with bortezomib. \n\nIn the Phase III study in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence \n\nof herpes zoster reactivation was more common in patients treated with \n\nBortezomib+Melphalan+Prednisone compared with Melphalan+Prednisone (14% versus 4% \nrespectively). \n\n \n\nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the \nBR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and infection \nWhen rituximab is used in combination with bortezomib, HBV screening must always be \n\nperformed in patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of \n\nhepatitis B and patients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and \n\nlaboratory signs of active HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment \nwith bortezomib. Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of rituximab for more information. \n\n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\nVery rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML \n\nand death, have been reported in patients treated with bortezomib. Patients diagnosed with PML \n\nhad prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within \n12 months of their first dose of bortezomib. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for \n\nany new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of \n\nthe differential diagnosis of CNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be \nreferred to a specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. \n\nDiscontinue bortezomib if PML is diagnosed. \n\n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nTreatment with bortezomib is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is \n\npredominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory \n\nperipheral neuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early \nin the treatment and has been observed to peak during cycle 5. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a \n\nburning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or \nweakness. \n\n \n\nPatients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo \n\nneurological evaluation and may require a change in the dose or schedule of bortezomib \n\n(see section 4.2). Neuropathy has been managed with supportive care and other therapies. \n \n\nEarly and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological \n\nevaluation should be considered in patients receiving bortezomib in combination with medicinal \nproducts known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose reduction \n\nor treatment discontinuation should be considered. \n\n \nIn addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some \n\nadverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on \n\nautonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited. \n\n \nSeizures \n\nSeizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or \n\nepilepsy. Special care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures. \n \n\nHypotension \n\nBortezomib treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse \n\nreactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who \ndeveloped orthostatic hypotension on bortezomib (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of \n\northostatic hypotension prior to treatment with bortezomib. Most patients required treatment for \n\ntheir orthostatic hypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced \nsyncopal events. Orthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of \n\nbortezomib. The mechanism of this event is unknown although a component may be due to \n\nautonomic neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may \naggravate an underlying condition such as diabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised \n\nwhen treating patients with a history of syncope receiving medicinal products known to be \n\nassociated with hypotension; or who are dehydrated due to recurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. \n\nManagement of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive \nmedicinal products, rehydration or administration of mineralocorticosteroids and/or \n\nsympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if they experience \n\nsymptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells. \n \n\nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \n\nThere have been reports of PRES in patients receiving bortezomib. PRES is a rare, often reversible, \nrapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, \n\nlethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, \n\npreferably Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients \n\ndeveloping PRES, bortezomib should be discontinued. \n \n\nHeart failure \n\nAcute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left \nventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be \n\na predisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or \n\nexisting heart disease should be closely monitored. \n\n \nElectrocardiogram investigations \n\nThere have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not \n\nbeen established. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nPulmonary disorders \n\nThere have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology \nsuch as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress \n\nsyndrome (ARDS) in patients receiving bortezomib (see section 4.8). Some of these events have \n\nbeen fatal. A pre-treatment chest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential \npost-treatment pulmonary changes. \n\n \n\nIn the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt \n\ndiagnostic evaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio \nshould be considered prior to continuing bortezomib therapy. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous \ninfusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and bortezomib for relapsed acute myelogenous \n\nleukaemia died of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, \n\nthis specific regimen with concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) \n\nby continuous infusion over 24 hours is not recommended. \n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nRenal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal \nimpairment should be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \nBortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with \n\nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with bortezomib at reduced \n\ndoses and closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \nHepatic reactions \n\nRare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving bortezomib and concomitant \n\nmedicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic \nreactions include increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may \n\nbe reversible upon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8). \n\n \nTumour lysis syndrome \n\nBecause bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells and MCL cells, \n\nthe complications of tumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis \n\nsyndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored \nclosely and appropriate precautions taken. \n\n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \nPatients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent \n\nCYP3A4-inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when bortezomib is combined with CYP3A4- or \n\nCYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5). \n\n \nNormal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving \n\noral hypoglycemics (see section 4.5). \n\n \nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions \n\nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis \n\nwith rash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib should \nbe discontinued if serious reactions occur. \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) \nisozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nthe metabolism of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect \n\nthe overall disposition of bortezomib. \nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC \n\nincrease of 35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should \nbe closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \n\nketoconazole, ritonavir). \n\n \n\nIn a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on \nthe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the \n\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients. \n\n \nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the \n\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC \n\nreduction of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John's \nWort) is not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. \n\n \n\nIn the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 \ninducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients. \n\n \nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the \n\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC \n\nincrease of 17% based on data from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant. \n\n \nDuring clinical trials, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were uncommonly and commonly reported \n\nin diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving \n\nbortezomib treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of \nthe dose of their antidiabetics. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nMale and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures \n\nduring and for 3 months following treatment. \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The \nteratogenic potential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated. \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and \n\nrabbits at the highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of \nbortezomib on parturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). \n\nBortezomib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman \n\nrequires treatment with bortezomib. \nIf bortezomib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this \n\nmedicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus. \n\n \nThalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening \n\nbirth defects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing \n\npotential unless all the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. \n\nPatients receiving bortezomib in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy \nprevention programme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \n\nthalidomide for additional information. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \nadverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \n\nbortezomib. \n\n \nFertility \n\nFertility studies were not conducted with bortezomib (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nBortezomib may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nBortezomib may be associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope \n\nuncommonly and orthostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, \npatients must be cautious when driving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or \n\noperate machinery if they experience these symptoms (see section 4.8). \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nSerious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with bortezomib include cardiac \n\nfailure, tumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy. \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with bortezomib are nausea, \n\ndiarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, \n\nperipheral neuropathy (including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, \nrash, herpes zoster and myalgia. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nMultiple myeloma \n\nUndesirable effects in table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or \n\nprobable causal relationship to bortezomib. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data \nset of 5,476 patients of whom 3,996 were treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in \n\ntable 7. \n\nOverall, bortezomib was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients. \n\n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are \n\ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order \n\nof decreasing seriousness. Table 7 has been generated using Version 14.1 of the MedDRA. \n\nPost-marketing adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials are also included. \n \n\nTable 7:  Adverse reactions in patients with

Postmarketing adverse reaction regardless of indication \n\n \n\nMantle cell lymphoma (MCL) \n\nThe safety profile of bortezomib in 240 MCL patients treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 in \ncombination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP) versus \n\n242 patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone \n\n[R-CHOP] was relatively consistent to that observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main \ndifferences described below. Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of \n\nthe combination therapy (BR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia \n\n(1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse \n\ndrug reactions are not attributable to bortezomib alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient \npopulation as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a \u2265 5% higher incidence \n\nof the haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, \n\nlymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and \nhair disorders. \n\nAdverse drug reactions identified as those with a \u2265 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the \n\nBR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the \nBR-CAP arm, are listed in table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in the \n\nBR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal \n\nrelationship to bortezomib based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies. \n\n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are \n\ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).

Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute \nonset of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical \n\ncardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, see section 5.3. \n\n \nThere is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the \n\npatient's vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood \n\npressure (such as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: \n\nL01XX32. \n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nBortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like \n\nactivity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex \nthat degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in \n\nregulating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. \n\nInhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling \ncascades within the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. \n\n \n\nBortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 \u03bcM concentrations, bortezomib does not \ninhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more \n\nselective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome \n\ninhibition were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome \n\nwith a t\u00bd of 20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible. \n \n\nBortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but \n\nnot limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor \nkappa B (NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. \n\nNF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, \n\nincluding cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, \n\nbortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow \nmicroenvironment. \n\n \n\nExperiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and \nthat cancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than \n\nnormal cells. Bortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour \n\nmodels, including multiple myeloma. \n \n\nData from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast \n\ndifferentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in \n\npatients with multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with \nbortezomib. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma \nA prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 \n\nVISTA) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected \n\nintravenously) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in \nimprovement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone \n\n(60 mg/m2) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered \n\nfor a maximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease \n\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nwere male, 88% were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the \n\npatients was 80. Patients had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median \nhemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a median platelet count of 221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients \n\nhad creatinine clearance \u2264 30 ml/min (3% in each arm). \n\nAt the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, time to progression, was met \nand patients in the M+P arm were offered B+M+P treatment. Median follow-up was 16.3 months. \n\nThe final survival update was performed with a median duration of follow-up of 60.1 months. A \n\nstatistically significant survival benefit in favour of the B+M+P treatment group was observed \n\n(HR=0.695; p=0.00043) despite subsequent therapies including bortezomib-based regimens. \nMedian survival for the B+M+P treatment group was 56.4 months compared to 43.1 for the M+P \n\ntreatment group.

Patients in the BDx group received four \n\n21 day cycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly \n\non days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in \ncycles 1 and 2, and on days 1 to 4 in cycles 3 and 4). \n\nAutologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in \n\nthe VDDx and BDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant \n\nprocedure. Patient demographic and baseline disease charateristics were similar between the \ntreatment groups. Median age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of \n\npatients had high-risk cytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx \n\ngroup and 11 weeks for the BDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups was \n4 cycles. \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR).

As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at \n\nthe recommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to \n\ndexamethasone were then offered bortezomib, regardless of disease status. Due to this early \n\ncrossover, the median duration of follow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients \nwho were refractory to their last prior therapy and those who were not refractory, overall survival \n\nwas significantly longer and response rate was significantly higher on the bortezomib arm. \n\n \nOf the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well \n\nas TTP remained significantly better for bortezomib independently of age. Regardless of \n\n\u03b22-microglobulin levels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (time to progression and overall \nsurvival, as well as response rate) were significantly improved on the bortezomib arm. \n\n \n\nIn the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent \n\nreview committee and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow Transplant \nGroup. The median survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ months). This \n\nsurvival was greater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by consultant clinical \n\ninvestigators for a similar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response rate was \nindependent of myeloma type, performance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the number \n\nor type of previous therapies. Patients who had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had a \n\nresponse rate of 32% (10/32) and patients who received greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens \nhad a response rate of 31% (21/67). \n\n \n\nTable 14: Summary of disease outcomes from the Phase III (APEX) and Phase II studies  \nPhase III Phase III Phase III Phase II \n\n \nAll patients 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy \n\n> 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy \n\n\u2265 2 prior \n\nlines \n\nTime related \n\nevents \n\nB \n\nn=333\na\n \n\nDex \n\nn=336\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=132\na\n \n\nDex \n\nn=119\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=200\na\n \n\nDex \n\nn=217\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=202\na\n \n\nTTP, days \n\n[95% CI] \n\n189b \n\n[148, 211] \n\n106b \n\n[86, 128] \n\n212d \n\n[188, 267] \n\n169d \n\n[105, 191] \n\n148b \n\n[129, 192] \n\n87b \n\n[84, 107] \n\n210 \n\n[154, 281] \n\n1 year survival, % \n\n[95% CI] \n\n \n\n80d \n\n[74,85] \n\n \n\n66d \n\n[59,72] \n\n \n\n89d \n\n[82,95] \n\n \n\n72d \n\n[62,83] \n\n \n\n73 \n\n[64,82] \n\n \n\n62 \n\n[53,71] \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\nBest response \n\n(%) \n\nB \n\nn=315c \n\nDex \n\nn=312c \n\nB \n\nn=128 \n\nDex \n\nn=110 \n\nB \n\nn=187 \n\nDex \n\nn=202 \n\nB \n\nn=193 \n\nCR 20 (6)b 2 (< 1)b 8 (6) 2 (2) 12 (6) 0 (0) (4)** \n\nCR+nCR 41 (13)b 5 (2)b 16 (13) 4 (4) 25 (13) 1 (< 1) (10)** \n\nCR+nCR+PR 121 (38)b 56 (18)b 57 (45)d 29 (26)d 64 (34)b 27 (13)b (27)** \n\nCR+nCR+PR+MR 146 (46) 108 (35) 66 (52) 45 (41) 80 (43) 63 (31) (35)** \n\nMedian duration \n\nDays (months) \n\n242 (8.0) 169 (5.6) 246 (8.1) 189 (6.2) 238 (7.8) 126 (4.1) 385* \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \nPhase III Phase III Phase III Phase II \n\n \nAll patients 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy \n> 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy \n\u2265 2 prior \n\nlines \n\nTime related \n\nevents \nB \n\nn=333\na\n \n\nDex \nn=336\n\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=132\na\n \n\nDex \nn=119\n\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=200\na\n \n\nDex \nn=217\n\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=202\na\n \n\nTime to response \nCR+PR (days) \n\n43 43 44 46 41 27 38* \n\na Intent to Treat (ITT) population \nb p-value from the stratified log-rank test; analysis by line of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic \n\nhistory; p < 0.0001 \nc Response population includes patients who had measurable disease at baseline and received at least 1 dose \n\nof study medicinal product. \nd p-value from the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test adjusted for the stratification factors; analysis by \n\nline of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic history \n\n* CR+PR+MR **CR=CR, (IF-); nCR=CR (IF+) \n\nNA=not applicable, NE=not estimated \n\nTTP-Time to Progression \n\nCI=Confidence Interval \n\nB=bortezomib; Dex=dexamethasone \nCR=Complete Response; nCR=near Complete response \n\nPR=Partial Response; MR=Minimal response \n\n \n\nIn the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with bortezomib \nalone were able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with bortezomib. The protocol \n\nallowed patients to receive dexamethasone if they had had a less than optimal response to \n\nbortezomib alone. A total of 74 evaluable patients were administered dexamethasone in \n\ncombination with bortezomib. Eighteen percent of patients achieved, or had an improved response \n[MR (11%) or PR (7%)] with combination treatment. \n\n \n\nBortezomib combination treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (study \nDOXIL-MMY-3001) \n\nA Phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 646 \n\npatients comparing the safety and efficacy of bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \n\nversus bortezomib monotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 \nprior therapy and who did not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy. The primary \n\nefficacy endpoint was TTP while the secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), \n\nusing the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. \nA protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination \n\nfor efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45% (95% CI; 29-57%, \n\np < 0.0001) for patients treated with combination therapy of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal \ndoxorubicin. The median TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients compared \n\nwith 9.3 months for the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy \n\npatients. These results, though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis. \n\nThe final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant \ndifference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; \n\n25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 28.9-37.1 \n\nmonths) for the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. \n \n\nBortezomib combination treatment with dexamethasone \n\nIn the absence of any direct comparison between bortezomib and bortezomib in combination with \ndexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis \n\nwas conducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of bortezomib in combination with \n\ndexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the bortezomib \n\nmonotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL \nMMY-3001) in the same indication. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nThe matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. \n\nbortezomib in combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. \nbortezomib) are made comparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study \n\nsubjects. This minimises the effects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects \n\nusing non-randomised data. \n \n\nOne hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis \n\ndemonstrated improved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS \n\n(hazard ratio 0.511; 95% CI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; \np=0.001) for bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone over bortezomib monotherapy. \n\n \n\nLimited information on bortezomib retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available. \nPhase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine \n\nthe efficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib. One hundred and thirty patients (\u2265 18 years \n\nof age) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a \n\nbortezomib-containing regimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior \ntherapy, bortezomib was started at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or \u2264 1.0 mg/m2 \n\n(n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single \n\nagent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. \nDexamethasone was administered in combination with bortezomib to 83 patients in cycle 1 with an \n\nadditional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of bortezomib retreatment cycles. \n\nThe primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. \nThe overall best response rate (CR+PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, \n\n47.4). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) \nStudy LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety \n\nof the combination of bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone \n\n(BR-CAP; n=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone \n(R-CHOP; n=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in \n\nthe BR-CAP treatment arm received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days \n\n12-21), rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 IV on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 day \n\nbortezomib treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional \n\ntreatment cycles were given. \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on Independent Review \nCommittee (IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included, time to progression (TTP), time to \n\nnext anti-lymphoma treatment (TNT), duration of treatment free interval (TFI), overall response \n\nrate (ORR) and complete response (CR/CRu) rate, overall survival (OS) and response duration. \n \n\nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the \n\ntwo treatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and \n\n32% Asian, 69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow \nbiopsy for MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of \u2265 3, and 76% \n\nhad Stage IV disease. Treatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up \n\n(median=40 months) were comparable in both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received \nby patients in both treatment arms with 14% of subjects in the BR-CAP group and 17% of patients \n\nin the R-CHOP group receiving 2 additional cycles. The majority of the patients in both groups \n\ncompleted treatment, 80% in the BR-CAP group and 82% in the R-CHOP group.

The median duration of complete response was 42.1 months in the \nBR-CAP group compared with 18 months in the R-CHOP group. The duration of overall response \n\nwas 21.4 months longer in the BR-CAP group (median 36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the \n\nR-CHOP group). The final analysis for OS was performed after a median follow-up of 82 months. \nMedian OS was 90.7 months for the BR-CAP group compared with 55.7 months for the R-CHOP \n\ngroup (HR=0.66; p=0.001). The observed final median difference in the OS between the 2 \n\ntreatment groups was 35 months. \n\n \nPatients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis \n\nAn open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy \n\nof bortezomib in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety \nconcerns were observed during the study, and in particular bortezomib did not exacerbate target \n\norgan damage (heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate \n\n(including a 28.6% CR rate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 \n\nevaluable patients treated with the maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 \ntwice-weekly. For these dose cohorts, the combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nbortezomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell \n\nlymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\nA Phase II, single arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children's \n\nOncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi agent re induction \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nchemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An \neffective reinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. Bortezomib \n\nwas administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with \n\ncoadministered drugs in Block 3. \n \n\nComplete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse \n\nwithin 18 months of diagnosis (n=27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event \n\nfree survival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from \ndiagnosis (n=33) the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate \n\nwas 73% (95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n=22) was 68% \n\n(95% CI: 45, 86) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported \nefficacy data are considered inconclusive (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThere were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 \n\nyears (range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to the \nstandard pediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions \n\n(grade \u2265 3) were observed at a higher incidence in the bortezomib containing treatment regimen as \n\ncompared with a historical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in \nBlock 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% \n\nversus 2%). No information on possible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were \n\navailable in this study. Higher incidences were also noted for infections with grade \u2265 3 neutropenia \n(24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in \n\nBlock 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and \n\nhyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 4% versus 0 in Block 2). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \nFollowing intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with \n\nmultiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose \n\nmaximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent \ndoses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the \n\n1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \nThe mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- \n\nor repeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple \n\nmyeloma. This suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib \nconcentration range of 0.01 to 1.0 \u03bcg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human \n\nplasma. The fraction of bortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 \n\nisozymes indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 \n\nenzymes, 3A4, 2C19, and 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two \ndeboronated metabolites that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. \n\nDeboronated-bortezomib metabolites are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors. \n\n \nElimination \n\nThe mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours. \n\nBortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. \n\nMean total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 \nand 1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent \n\ndoses for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I \n\nstudy during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying \n\ndegrees of hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2. \n \n\nWhen compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter \n\ndose-normalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were \n\nincreased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower \nstarting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those \n\npatients should be closely monitored (see section 4.2, table 6). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who \n\nwere classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups: \n\nNormal (CrCL \u2265 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL=40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate \n(CrCL=20-39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of \n\ndialysis patients who were dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were \n\nadministered intravenous doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib twice weekly. Exposure of \nbortezomib (dose-normalised AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \nAge \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus \n\nadministration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 pediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis, clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area \n\n(BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at \n\nsteady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After \ncorrecting for the BSA effect, other demographics such as age, body weight and sex did not have \n\nclinically significant effects on bortezomib clearance. BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in \n\npediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nBortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the \n\nin vitro chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations \nas low as 3.125 \u03bcg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not \n\ngenotoxic when tested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus \n\nassay in mice. \n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally \n\ntoxic doses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies \nwere not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general \n\ntoxicity studies. In the 6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have \n\nbeen observed. It is, therefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or \n\nfemale fertility. Peri- and postnatal development studies were not conducted. \n \n\nIn multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs \n\nincluded the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and \nlymphatic tissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and \n\nhaematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice \n\nand dogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs \nhave shown partial to full recovery following discontinuation of treatment. \n\nBased on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to \n\nbe limited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nCardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses \napproximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated \n\nwith increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the \n\ndecreased cardiac contractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive \ninotropic or pressor agents. Moreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval \n\nwas observed. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol (E 421) \n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n2 years \n \nReconstituted solution \nThe chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution has been demonstrated at \nconcentrations of 1 mg/ml  for 96 hours at 25\u00b0C and 8 days at 2-8\u00b0C, when stored in the original \nvial and/or a syringe.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately after \npreparation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBortezomib as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or \ndexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma \n\nwho have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \nBortezomib in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult \n\npatients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose \n\nchemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n \n\nBortezomib in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is \n\nindicated for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma \nwho are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nBortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is \n\nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who \nare unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nBortezomib treatment must be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of cancer patients, however bortezomib may be administered by a healthcare professional \n\nexperienced in use of chemotherapeutic agents. Bortezomib must be reconstituted by a healthcare \n\nprofessional (see section 6.6). \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nPosology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one \nprior therapy) \n\nMonotherapy \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via \nintravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area \n\ntwice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period \n\nis considered a treatment cycle. It is recommended that patients receive 2 cycles of bortezomib \n\nfollowing a confirmation of a complete response. It is also recommended that responding patients \nwho do not achieve a complete remission receive a total of 8 cycles of bortezomib therapy. At least \n\n72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib. \n\n \nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy \n\nBortezomib treatment must be withheld at the onset of any grade 3 non-haematological or any \n\ngrade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4). \n\nOnce the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, bortezomib treatment may be re-initiated at a \n25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2; 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the \n\ntoxicity is not resolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of bortezomib must be \n\nconsidered unless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk. \n \n\nNeuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy \n\nPatients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to \nbe managed as presented in table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy \n\nmay be treated with bortezomib only after careful risk/benefit assessment. \n\n \n\nTable 1:  Recommended* posology modifications for bortezomib-related neuropathy \n\nSeverity of neuropathy Posology modification \n\nGrade 1 (asymptomatic; loss of deep tendon \n\nreflexes or paresthesia) with no pain or loss of \n\nfunction \n\nNone \n\nGrade 1 with pain or grade 2 (moderate \n\nsymptoms; limiting instrumental Activities of \n\nDaily Living (ADL)**) \n\nReduce bortezomib to 1.0 mg/m2 \n\nor \n\nChange bortezomib treatment schedule to \n\n1.3 mg/m2 once per week. \n\nGrade 2 with pain or grade 3 (severe symptoms; \n\nlimiting self care ADL***) \n\nWithhold bortezomib treatment until symptoms \n\nof toxicity have resolved. When toxicity resolves \n\nre-initiate bortezomib treatment and reduce dose \n\nto 0.7 mg/m2 once per week \n\nGrade 4 (life-threatening consequences; urgent \n\nintervention indicated)  \n\nand/or severe autonomic neuropathy \n\nDiscontinue bortezomib \n\n* Based on posology modifications in Phase II and III multiple myeloma studies and post-marketing \n\nexperience. \n\nGrading based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria CTCAE v 4.0. \n\n** Instrumental ADL: refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using telephone, managing \n\nmoney, etc; \n\n*** Self care ADL: refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medicinal \n\nproducts, and not bedridden. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via \n\nintravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area \n\ntwice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day treatment cycle. This 3-week period \n\nis considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of \n\nbortezomib. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nPegylated liposomal doxorubicin is administered at 30 mg/m2 on day 4 of the bortezomib treatment \n\ncycle as a 1 hour intravenous infusion administered after the bortezomib injection. \n\nUp to 8 cycles of this combination therapy can be administered as long as patients have not \n\nprogressed and tolerate treatment. Patients achieving a complete response can continue treatment \n\nfor at least 2 cycles after the first evidence of complete response, even if this requires treatment for \n\nmore than 8 cycles. Patients whose levels of paraprotein continue to decrease after 8 cycles can also \n\ncontinue for as long as treatment is tolerated and they continue to respond. \n\nFor additional information concerning pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, see the corresponding \n\nSummary of Product Characteristics. \n\n \n\nCombination with dexamethasone \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via \n\nintravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area \n\ntwice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21 day treatment cycle. This 3-week period \n\nis considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of \n\nbortezomib. \n\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the \n\nbortezomib treatment cycle. \n\nPatients achieving a response or a stable disease after 4 cycles of this combination therapy can \n\ncontinue to receive the same combination for a maximum of 4 additional cycles. \n\nFor additional information concerning dexamethasone, see the corresponding Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments for combination therapy for patients with progressive multiple myeloma \n\nFor bortezomib dosage adjustments for combination therapy follow dose modification guidelines \n\ndescribed under monotherapy above. \n\n \n\nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients not eligible for haematopoietic stem \n\ncell transplantation \n\nCombination therapy with melphalan and prednisone \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is administered via \n\nintravenous or subcutaneous injection in combination with oral melphalan and oral prednisone as \n\nshown in table 2.

For bortezomib-related neuropathic \n\npain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or \n\nmodify bortezomib as outlined in table 1. \n\n \nIn addition, when bortezomib is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal \n\nproducts, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the \n\nevent of toxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product \nCharacteristics. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \nElderly \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age \n\nwith multiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma. \nThere are no studies on the use of bortezomib in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple \n\nmyeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplantation. Therefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population. \nIn a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients \n\nexposed to bortezomib were in the range 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years of age, respectively. In \n\npatients aged \u2265 75 years, both regimens, BR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per \nthe recommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on \n\nbortezomib at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a \n\nsubsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered \n\nbased on patient tolerability (see table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\nTable 6:  Recommended starting dose modification for bortezomib in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment \n\nGrade of hepatic \n\nimpairment* \nBilirubin level SGOT (AST) \n\nlevels \nModification of starting \n\ndose \n\nMild \u2264 1.0 x ULN > ULN None \n\n> 1.0 x \u22121.5 x ULN Any None \n\nModerate > 1.5 x \u22123 x ULN Any Reduce bortezomib to \n\n0.7 mg/m2 in the first \n\ntreatment cycle.

It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced \nin patients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\nSince dialysis may reduce bortezomib concentrations, bortezomib should be administered after the \n\ndialysis procedure (see section 5.2). \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of bortezomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established \n\n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous \n\nadministration only.  \n\n \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nsubcutaneous administration. \n\n \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is available for intravenous or \n\nsubcutaneous administration. \n\n \nBortezomib should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death. \n\n \n\nIntravenous injection \n\nBortezomib reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection \nthrough a peripheral or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride \n\n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses \n\nof bortezomib. \n \n\nSubcutaneous injection \n\nBortezomib reconstituted solution is administered subcutaneously through the thighs (right or left) \n\nor abdomen (right or left). The solution should be injected subcutaneously, at a 45-90\u00b0 angle. \nInjection sites should be rotated for successive injections. \n\n \n\nIf local injection site reactions occur following bortezomib subcutaneous injection, either a less \nconcentrated bortezomib solution (bortezomib to be reconstituted to 1 mg/ml instead of 2.5 mg/ml) \n\nmay be administered subcutaneously or a switch to intravenous injection is recommended. \n\n \nWhen bortezomib is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the Summary of \n\nProduct Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nAcute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease. \n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their Summaries \n\nof Product Characteristics for additional contraindications. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment \n\nwith bortezomib. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and \n\nprevention requirements is needed (see section 4.6). \n\n \nIntrathecal administration \n\nThere have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of bortezomib. Bortezomib \n\nFresenius Kabi 1 mg powder for solution for injection is for intravenous use only, while \nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 and 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection is for intravenous or \n\nsubcutaneous use. Bortezomib should not be administered intrathecally. \n\n \nGastrointestinal toxicity \n\nGastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common \n\nwith bortezomib treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). \n\nTherefore, patients who experience constipation should be closely monitored. \n \n\nHaematological toxicity \n\nBortezomib treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities \n(thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia). In studies in patients with relapsed multiple \n\nmyeloma treated with bortezomib and in patients with previously untreated MCL treated with \n\nbortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n(BR-CAP), one of the most common haematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. \n\nPlatelets were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of bortezomib treatment and typically recovered to \nbaseline by the next cycle. There was no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia. The mean \n\nplatelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of baseline in the single-agent multiple \n\nmyeloma studies and 50% in the MCL study. In patients with advanced myeloma the severity of \nthrombocytopenia was related to pre-treatment platelet count: for baseline platelet counts \n\n< 75,000/\u03bcl, 90% of 21 patients had a count \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study, including 14% \n\n< 10,000/\u03bcl; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count > 75,000/\u03bcl, only 14% of 309 patients had a \n\ncount \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study. \n \n\nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of \n\ngrade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia in the bortezomib treatment group (BR-CAP) as compared to the \nnon-bortezomib treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and \n\nprednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence \n\nof all-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the BR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well \n\nas grade 3 and higher bleeding events (BR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In \nthe BR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients \n\nin the R-CHOP group. \n\n \nGastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with bortezomib \n\ntreatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of bortezomib. \n\nBortezomib therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/\u03bcl or, in the case of \ncombination with melphalan and prednisone, when the platelet count is \u2264 30,000/\u03bcl (see \n\nsection 4.2). Potential benefit of the treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, \n\nparticularly in case of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding. \n\n \nComplete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently \n\nmonitored throughout treatment with bortezomib. Platelet transfusion should be considered when \n\nclinically appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \n\nIn patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with \n\nno evidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of \nbortezomib treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, \n\ncolony stimulating factor support was given to 78% of patients in the BR-CAP arm and 61% of \n\npatients in the R-CHOP arm. Since patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, \n\nthey should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte \ncolony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local \n\nstandard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered \n\nin case of repeated delays in cycle administration (see section 4.2). \n \n\nHerpes zoster virus reactivation \n\nAntiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with bortezomib. \n\nIn the Phase III study in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence \nof herpes zoster reactivation was more common in patients treated with \n\nBortezomib+Melphalan+Prednisone compared with Melphalan+Prednisone (14% versus 4% \n\nrespectively). \nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the \n\nBR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8). \n\n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and infection \n\nWhen rituximab is used in combination with bortezomib, HBV screening must always be \n\nperformed in patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of \n\nhepatitis B and patients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and \nlaboratory signs of active HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment \n\nwith bortezomib. Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of rituximab for more information. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nVery rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML \n\nand death, have been reported in patients treated with bortezomib. Patients diagnosed with PML \n\nhad prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within \n12 months of their first dose of bortezomib. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for \n\nany new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of \n\nthe differential diagnosis of CNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be \n\nreferred to a specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. \nDiscontinue bortezomib if PML is diagnosed. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \nTreatment with bortezomib is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is \n\npredominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory \n\nperipheral neuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early \n\nin the treatment and has been observed to peak during cycle 5. \n \n\nIt is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a \n\nburning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or \nweakness. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase III study comparing bortezomib administered intravenously versus subcutaneously, the \nincidence of grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% for the subcutaneous injection group \n\nand 41% for the intravenous injection group (p=0.0124). Grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred \n\nin 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 16% in the intravenous \n\ntreatment group (p=0.0264). The incidence of all grade peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib \nadministered intravenously was lower in the historical studies with bortezomib administered \n\nintravenously than in study MMY-3021. \n\n \nPatients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo neurological \n\nevaluation and may require a change in the dose, schedule or route of administration to \n\nsubcutaneous (see section 4.2). Neuropathy has been managed with supportive care and other \ntherapies. \n\n \n\nEarly and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological \n\nevaluation should be considered in patients receiving bortezomib in combination with medicinal \nproducts known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose reduction \n\nor treatment discontinuation should be considered. \n\n \nIn addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some \n\nadverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on \n\nautonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited. \n\n \nSeizures \n\nSeizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or \n\nepilepsy. Special care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures. \n \n\nHypotension \n\nBortezomib treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse \nreactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who \n\ndeveloped orthostatic hypotension on bortezomib (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of \n\northostatic hypotension prior to treatment with bortezomib. Most patients required treatment for \n\ntheir orthostatic hypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced \nsyncopal events. Orthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of \n\nbortezomib. The mechanism of this event is unknown although a component may be due to \n\nautonomic neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\naggravate an underlying condition such as diabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised \n\nwhen treating patients with a history of syncope receiving medicinal products known to be \nassociated with hypotension; or who are dehydrated due to recurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. \n\nManagement of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive \n\nmedicinal products, rehydration or administration of mineralocorticosteroids and/or \nsympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if they experience \n\nsymptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells. \n\n \n\nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \nThere have been reports of PRES in patients receiving bortezomib. PRES is a rare, often reversible, \n\nrapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, \n\nlethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, \npreferably Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients \n\ndeveloping PRES, bortezomib should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \nAcute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left \n\nventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be \n\na predisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or \nexisting heart disease should be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nElectrocardiogram investigations \nThere have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not \n\nbeen established. \n\n \n\nPulmonary disorders \nThere have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology \n\nsuch as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress \n\nsyndrome (ARDS) in patients receiving bortezomib (see section 4.8). Some of these events have \nbeen fatal. A pre-treatment chest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential \n\npost-treatment pulmonary changes. \n\n \nIn the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt \n\ndiagnostic evaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio \n\nshould be considered prior to continuing bortezomib therapy. \n\n \nIn a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous \n\ninfusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and bortezomib for relapsed acute myelogenous \n\nleukaemia died of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, \nthis specific regimen with concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) \n\nby continuous infusion over 24 hours is not recommended. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \nRenal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal \n\nimpairment should be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n\nBortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with \n\nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with bortezomib at reduced \ndoses and closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic reactions \n\nRare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving bortezomib and concomitant \nmedicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic \n\nreactions include increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may \n\nbe reversible upon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \nBecause bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells and MCL cells, \n\nthe complications of tumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis \n\nsyndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored \nclosely and appropriate precautions taken. \n\n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nPatients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent \nCYP3A4-inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when bortezomib is combined with CYP3A4- or \n\nCYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5). \n\n \nNormal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving \n\noral hypoglycemics (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions \nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis \n\nwith rash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib should \n\nbe discontinued if serious reactions occur. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) \n\nisozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to \nthe metabolism of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect \n\nthe overall disposition of bortezomib. \n\nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on \nthe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC \n\nincrease of 35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should \n\nbe closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \n\nketoconazole, ritonavir). \n \n\nIn a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients. \n\n \n\nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the \n\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC \nreduction of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John's \n\nWort) is not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. \n \n\nIn the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 \n\ninducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients. \n\n \n\nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the \n\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC \nincrease of 17% based on data from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical trials, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were uncommonly and commonly reported \nin diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving \n\nbortezomib treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of \n\nthe dose of their antidiabetics. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nContraception in males and females \n\nMale and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures \n\nduring and for 3 months following treatment. \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The \n\nteratogenic potential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated. \n \n\nIn non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and \n\nrabbits at the highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of \nbortezomib on parturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). \n\nBortezomib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman \n\nrequires treatment with bortezomib. \n\nIf bortezomib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this \nmedicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus. \n\n \n\nThalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening \nbirth defects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing \n\npotential unless all the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. \n\nPatients receiving bortezomib in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy \nprevention programme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \n\nthalidomide for additional information. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \n\nadverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \n\nbortezomib. \n \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies were not conducted with bortezomib (see section 5.3). \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nBortezomib may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nBortezomib may be associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope \nuncommonly and orthostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, \n\npatients must be cautious when driving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or \n\noperate machinery if they experience these symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nSerious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with bortezomib include cardiac \nfailure, tumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy \n\nsyndrome, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy. \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with bortezomib are nausea, \ndiarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, \n\nperipheral neuropathy (including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, \n\nrash, herpes zoster and myalgia. \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nUndesirable effects in table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or \nprobable causal relationship to bortezomib. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nset of 5,476 patients of whom 3,996 were treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in \n\ntable 7. \nOverall, bortezomib was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are \ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \n\nfrom the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order \n\nof decreasing seriousness. Table 7 has been generated using Version 14.1 of the MedDRA. \nPost-marketing adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials are also included. \n\n \n\nTable 7:  Adverse reactions in patients with

Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of \nthe combination therapy (BR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia \n\n(1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse \n\ndrug reactions are not attributable to bortezomib alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient \npopulation as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a \u2265 5% higher incidence \n\nof the haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, \n\nlymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and \n\nhair disorders. \nAdverse drug reactions identified as those with a \u2265 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the \n\nBR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the \n\nBR-CAP arm, are listed in table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in the \nBR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal \n\nrelationship to bortezomib based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping.

All grade peripheral neuropathy and grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 40% \n\nand 8.5% of patients, respectively. \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute \n\nonset of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical \ncardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, see section 5.3. \n\n \n\nThere is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the \npatient's vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood \n\npressure (such as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). \n \n \n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: \nL01XX32. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \nBortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like \n\nactivity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex \n\nthat degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in \n\nregulating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nInhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling \n\ncascades within the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. \n \n\nBortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 \u03bcM concentrations, bortezomib does not \n\ninhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more \nselective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome \n\ninhibition were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome \n\nwith a t\u00bd of 20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible. \n\n \nBortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but \n\nnot limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor \n\nkappa B (NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. \nNF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, \n\nincluding cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, \n\nbortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow \n\nmicroenvironment. \n \n\nExperiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and \n\nthat cancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than \nnormal cells. Bortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour \n\nmodels, including multiple myeloma. \n\n \nData from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast \n\ndifferentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in \n\npatients with multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with \n\nbortezomib. \n \n\nClinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma \n\nA prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 \nVISTA) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected \n\nintravenously) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in \n\nimprovement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone \n(60 mg/m2) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered \n\nfor a maximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease \n\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% \n\nwere male, 88% were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the \npatients was 80. Patients had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median \n\nhemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a median platelet count of 221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients \n\nhad creatinine clearance \u2264 30 ml/min (3% in each arm). \nAt the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, time to progression, was met \n\nand patients in the M+P arm were offered B+M+P treatment.

Patients in the BDx group received four \n\n21 day cycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly \n\non days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in \ncycles 1 and 2, and on days 1 to 4 in cycles 3 and 4). \n\nAutologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in \n\nthe VDDx and BDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant \nprocedure. Patient demographic and baseline disease charateristics were similar between the \n\ntreatment groups. Median age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of \n\npatients had high-risk cytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx \n\ngroup and 11 weeks for the BDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups was \n4 cycles. \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR).

As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at \n\nthe recommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to \ndexamethasone were then offered bortezomib, regardless of disease status. Due to this early \n\ncrossover, the median duration of follow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients \n\nwho were refractory to their last prior therapy and those who were not refractory, overall survival \nwas significantly longer and response rate was significantly higher on the bortezomib arm. \n\n \n\nOf the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well \n\nas TTP remained significantly better for bortezomib independently of age. Regardless of \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n\u03b22-microglobulin levels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (time to progression and overall \n\nsurvival, as well as response rate) were significantly improved on the bortezomib arm. \n \n\nIn the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent \n\nreview committee and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow Transplant \nGroup. The median survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ months). This \n\nsurvival was greater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by consultant clinical \n\ninvestigators for a similar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response rate was \n\nindependent of myeloma type, performance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the number \nor type of previous therapies. Patients who had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had a \n\nresponse rate of 32% (10/32) and patients who received greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens \n\nhad a response rate of 31% (21/67). \n \n\nTable 14: Summary of disease outcomes from the Phase III (APEX) and Phase II studies  \nPhase III Phase III Phase III Phase II \n\n \nAll patients 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy \n\n> 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy \n\n\u2265 2 prior \n\nlines \n\nTime related \n\nevents \n\nB \n\nn=333\na\n \n\nDex \n\nn=336\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=132\na\n \n\nDex \n\nn=119\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=200\na\n \n\nDex \n\nn=217\na\n \n\nB \n\nn=202\na\n \n\nTTP, days \n\n[95% CI] \n\n189b \n\n[148, 211] \n\n106b \n\n[86, 128] \n\n212d \n\n[188, 267] \n\n169d \n\n[105, 191] \n\n148b \n\n[129, 192] \n\n87b \n\n[84, 107] \n\n210 \n\n[154, 281] \n\n1 year survival, % \n\n[95% CI] \n\n \n\n80d \n\n[74,85] \n\n \n\n66d \n\n[59,72] \n\n \n\n89d \n\n[82,95] \n\n \n\n72d \n\n[62,83] \n\n \n\n73 \n\n[64,82] \n\n \n\n62 \n\n[53,71] \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\nBest response \n\n(%) \n\nB \n\nn=315c \n\nDex \n\nn=312c \n\nB \n\nn=128 \n\nDex \n\nn=110 \n\nB \n\nn=187 \n\nDex \n\nn=202 \n\nB \n\nn=193 \n\nCR 20 (6)b 2 (< 1)b 8 (6) 2 (2) 12 (6) 0 (0) (4)** \n\nCR+nCR 41 (13)b 5 (2)b 16 (13) 4 (4) 25 (13) 1 (< 1) (10)** \n\nCR+nCR+PR 121 (38)b 56 (18)b 57 (45)d 29 (26)d 64 (34)b 27 (13)b (27)** \n\nCR+nCR+PR+MR 146 (46) 108 (35) 66 (52) 45 (41) 80 (43) 63 (31) (35)** \n\nMedian duration \n\nDays (months) \n\n242 (8.0) 169 (5.6) 246 (8.1) 189 (6.2) 238 (7.8) 126 (4.1) 385* \n\nTime to response \n\nCR+PR (days) \n\n43 43 44 46 41 27 38* \n\na Intent to Treat (ITT) population \nb p-value from the stratified log-rank test; analysis by line of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic \n\nhistory; p < 0.0001 \nc Response population includes patients who had measurable disease at baseline and received at least 1 dose \n\nof study medicinal product. \nd p-value from the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test adjusted for the stratification factors; analysis by \n\nline of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic history \n\n* CR+PR+MR **CR=CR, (IF-); nCR=CR (IF+) \nNA=not applicable, NE=not estimated \n\nTTP-Time to Progression \n\nCI=Confidence Interval \n\nB=bortezomib; Dex=dexamethasone \n\nCR=Complete Response; nCR=near Complete response \n\nPR=Partial Response; MR=Minimal response \n\n \nIn the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with bortezomib \n\nalone were able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with bortezomib.

The primary \nefficacy endpoint was TTP while the secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), \n\nusing the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. \n\nA protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination \n\nfor efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45% (95% CI; 29-57%, \np < 0.0001) for patients treated with combination therapy of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal \n\ndoxorubicin. The median TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients compared \n\nwith 9.3 months for the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy \npatients. These results, though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis. \n\nThe final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant \n\ndifference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; \n25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 28.9-37.1 \n\nmonths) for the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. \n\nBortezomib combination treatment with dexamethasone \n\nIn the absence of any direct comparison between bortezomib and bortezomib in combination with \ndexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis \n\nwas conducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of bortezomib in combination with \n\ndexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the bortezomib \nmonotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL \n\nMMY-3001) in the same indication. \n\nThe matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. \n\nbortezomib in combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. \nbortezomib) are made comparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study \n\nsubjects. This minimises the effects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects \n\nusing non-randomised data. \nOne hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis \n\ndemonstrated improved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS \n\n(hazard ratio 0.511; 95% CI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; \np=0.001) for bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone over bortezomib monotherapy. \n\n \n\nLimited information on bortezomib retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available. \n\nPhase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine \nthe efficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib. One hundred and thirty patients (\u2265 18 years \n\nof age) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a \n\nbortezomib-containing regimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior \ntherapy, bortezomib was started at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or \u2264 1.0 mg/m2 \n\n(n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single \n\nagent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. \nDexamethasone was administered in combination with bortezomib to 83 patients in cycle 1 with an \n\nadditional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of bortezomib retreatment cycles. \n\nThe primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. \n\nThe overall best response rate (CR+PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, \n47.4). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) \n\nStudy LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety \nof the combination of bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone \n\n(BR-CAP; n=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone \n\n(R-CHOP; n=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in \nthe BR-CAP treatment arm received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days \n\n12-21), rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin \n\n50 mg/m2 IV on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 day \n\nbortezomib treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional \ntreatment cycles were given. \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on Independent Review \n\nCommittee (IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included, time to progression (TTP), time to \nnext anti-lymphoma treatment (TNT), duration of treatment free interval (TFI), overall response \n\nrate (ORR) and complete response (CR/CRu) rate, overall survival (OS) and response duration. \n\n \n\nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the \ntwo treatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and \n\n32% Asian, 69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow \n\nbiopsy for MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of \u2265 3, and 76% \nhad Stage IV disease. Treatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up \n\n(median=40 months) were comparable in both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received \n\nby patients in both treatment arms with 14% of subjects in the BR-CAP group and 17% of patients \nin the R-CHOP group receiving 2 additional cycles. The majority of the patients in both groups \n\ncompleted treatment, 80% in the BR-CAP group and 82% in the R-CHOP group.

A statistically significant benefit \n(p < 0.001) in favour of the BR-CAP treatment group over the R-CHOP group was observed for \n\nTTP (median 30.5 versus 16.1 months), TNT (median 44.5 versus 24.8 months) and TFI (median \n\n40.6 versus 20.5 months). The median duration of complete response was 42.1 months in the \nBR-CAP group compared with 18 months in the R-CHOP group. The duration of overall response \n\nwas 21.4 months longer in the BR-CAP group (median 36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the \n\nR-CHOP group). The final analysis for OS was performed after a median follow-up of 82 months. \nMedian OS was 90.7 months for the BR-CAP group compared with 55.7 months for the R-CHOP \ngroup (HR=0.66; p=0.001). The observed final median difference in the OS between the 2 \n\ntreatment groups was 35 months. \n\n \nPatients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis \n\nAn open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy \n\nof bortezomib in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety \n\nconcerns were observed during the study, and in particular bortezomib did not exacerbate target \norgan damage (heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate \n\n(including a 28.6% CR rate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 \n\nevaluable patients treated with the maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 \ntwice-weekly. For these dose cohorts, the combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nbortezomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell \n\nlymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \nA Phase II, single arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children's \n\nOncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi agent re induction \n\nchemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An \n\neffective reinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. Bortezomib \n\nwas administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with \ncoadministered drugs in Block 3. \n\n \n\nComplete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse \n\nwithin 18 months of diagnosis (n=27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event \nfree survival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from \n\ndiagnosis (n=33) the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate \n\nwas 73% (95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n=22) was 68% \n(95% CI: 45, 86) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported \n\nefficacy data are considered inconclusive (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThere were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 \nyears (range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to the \n\nstandard pediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions \n\n(grade \u2265 3) were observed at a higher incidence in the bortezomib containing treatment regimen as \ncompared with a historical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in \n\nBlock 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% \n\nversus 2%). No information on possible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were \navailable in this study. Higher incidences were also noted for infections with grade \u2265 3 neutropenia \n\n(24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in \n\nBlock 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and \n\nhyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 4% versus 0 in Block 2). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nAbsorption \n\nFollowing intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with \n\nmultiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose \nmaximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent \n\ndoses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the \n\n1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose. \n\n \nFollowing an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m2 dose to patients with \n\nmultiple myeloma (n=14 in the intravenous group, n=17 in the subcutaneous group), the total \n\nsystemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUClast) was equivalent for subcutaneous and \nintravenous administrations. The Cmax after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/ml) was lower \n\nthan intravenous (223 ng/ml). The AUClast geometric mean ratio was 0.99 and 90% confidence \n\nintervals were 80.18%-122.80%. \n\n \nDistribution \n\nThe mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- \n\nor repeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple \nmyeloma. This suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib \n\nconcentration range of 0.01 to 1.0 \u03bcg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human \n\nplasma. The fraction of bortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent. \n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 \n\nisozymes indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 \nenzymes, 3A4, 2C19, and 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two \n\ndeboronated metabolites that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. \n\nDeboronated-bortezomib metabolites are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors. \n \n\nElimination \n\nThe mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours. \nBortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. \n\nMean total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 \n\nand 1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent \n\ndoses for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively. \n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I \n\nstudy during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying \n\ndegrees of hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2. \n\n \nWhen compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter \n\ndose-normalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were \n\nincreased by approximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower \nstarting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those \n\npatients should be closely monitored (see section 4.2, table 6). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who \n\nwere classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups: \n\nNormal (CrCL \u2265 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL=40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate \n(CrCL=20-39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of \n\ndialysis patients who were dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were \n\nadministered intravenous doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib twice weekly. Exposure of \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nbortezomib (dose-normalised AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see \n\nsection 4.2). \nAge \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus \n\nadministration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 pediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis, clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area \n\n(BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at \n\nsteady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After \ncorrecting for the BSA effect, other demographics such as age, body weight and sex did not have \n\nclinically significant effects on bortezomib clearance. BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in \n\npediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nBortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the \nin vitro chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations \n\nas low as 3.125 \u03bcg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not \n\ngenotoxic when tested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus \n\nassay in mice. \n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally \n\ntoxic doses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies \nwere not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general \n\ntoxicity studies. In the 6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have \n\nbeen observed. It is, therefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or \nfemale fertility. Peri- and postnatal development studies were not conducted. \n\n \n\nIn multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs \n\nincluded the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and \nlymphatic tissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and \n\nhaematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice \n\nand dogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs \nhave shown partial to full recovery following discontinuation of treatment. \n\nBased on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to \n\nbe limited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown. \n\n \nCardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses \n\napproximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated \n\nwith increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the \ndecreased cardiac contractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive \n\ninotropic or pressor agents. Moreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval \n\nwas observed. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol (E 421) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n2 years \n \nReconstituted solution \nThe chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution has been demonstrated at \nconcentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml for 96 hours at 25\u00b0C and 8 days at 2-8\u00b0C, when stored in \nthe original vial and/or a syringe.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately after \npreparation.

What you need to know before you use Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n\n3. How to use Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n \n\n1. What Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called \u2018proteasome inhibitor\u2019. \n\nProteasomes play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with \n\ntheir function, bortezomib can kill cancer cells. \n \n\nBortezomib is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients \n\nolder than 18 years: \n- alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, for \n\npatients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior treatment \n\nand for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is unsuitable. \n- in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease has \n\nnot been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem \n\ncell transplantation. \n\n- in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with \nthalidomide, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before receiving \n\nhigh-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction treatment). \n\n \nBortezomib is used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph \n\nnodes) in patients 18 years or older in combination with the medicines rituximab, \n\ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously \n\ntreated and for whom blood stem cell transplantation is unsuitable. \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n\n \n\nDo not use bortezomib  \n\n- if you are allergic to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6) \n\n- if you have certain severe lung or heart problems. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you have any of the following: \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n\u2022 low numbers of red or white blood cells \n\n\u2022 bleeding problems and/or low number of platelets in your blood \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting \n\n\u2022 fainting, dizziness or light-headedness in the past \n\n\u2022 kidney problems \n\n\u2022 moderate to severe liver problems \n\n\u2022 numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet (neuropathy) in the past \n\n\u2022 heart or blood pressure problems \n\n\u2022 shortness of breath or cough \n\n\u2022 seizures \n\n\u2022 shingles (localised including around the eyes or spread across the body) \n\n\u2022 symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome such as muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, \nvisual loss or disturbances and shortness of breath \n\n\u2022 memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty with walking or loss of vision. These may be signs \nof a serious brain infection and your doctor may suggest further testing and follow-up. \n\n \n\nYou will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with bortezomib, to \n\ncheck your blood cell counts regularly. \n \n\nIf you have mantle cell lymphoma and are given the medicine rituximab with bortezomib you must \n\ntell your doctor: \n\n\u2022 if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, \npatients who have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be \n\nfatal. If you have a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your \n\ndoctor for signs of active hepatitis B. \n\n \nYou must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with \n\nbortezomib for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with bortezomib. \n\nWhen thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is \nneeded (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThis medicine must not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how it will \naffect them. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and bortezomib  \n\nPlease tell your doctor, or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active \nsubstances: \n\n- ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections \n- ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection \n- rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections \n- carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat epilepsy \n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), used for depression or other conditions \n- oral antidiabetics \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou must not use this medicine if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary. \n \n\nBoth men and women receiving bortezomib must use effective contraception during and for up to 3 \n\nmonths after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nYou must not breast-feed while using bortezomib. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to \n\nrestart breast-feeding after finishing your treatment. \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\nThalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When bortezomib is given in combination with \nthalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package \n\nleaflet for thalidomide). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n\nBortezomib might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate \n\ntools or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you must still be cautious. \n\n \n \n\n3. How to use Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n\n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of bortezomib according to your height and weight (body \n\nsurface area). The usual starting dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week. \n\nYour doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your \n\nresponse to the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying \nconditions (e.g. liver problems). \n\n \n\nProgressive multiple myeloma \nWhen bortezomib is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of bortezomib intravenously on days 1, \n\n4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day \u2018rest period\u2019 without treatment. This 21-day period (3 weeks) \n\ncorresponds to one treatment cycle. You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n \n\nYou may also be given bortezomib together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or \n\ndexamethasone. \n\n \nWhen bortezomib is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive \n\nbortezomib intravenously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \n\n30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous infusion \nafter the bortezomib injection. \n\nYou might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \nWhen bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously \n\nas a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, \n\nand 12, of the bortezomib, 21-day treatment cycle. \n\nYou might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n \n\nPreviously untreated multiple myeloma \n\nIf you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem \ncell transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously together with two other medicines; \n\nmelphalan and prednisone. \n\nIn this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles \n\n(54 weeks). \n\n\u2022 In cycles 1 to 4, bortezomib is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and \n32. \n\n\u2022 In cycles 5 to 9, bortezomib is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. \nMelphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the \n\nfirst week of each cycle. \n \n\nIf you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell \n\ntransplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously together with the medicines \ndexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment. \n\n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously \n\nas a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 \nand 11 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nYou will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks). \n\n \nWhen bortezomib is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of a \n\ntreatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). \n\n \nDexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 28-day \n\ntreatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if \n\ntolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased \n\nto 200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards. \nYou might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated mantle cell lymphoma \nIf you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive bortezomib \n\nintravenously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and \n\nprednisone. \n\nBortezomib is given intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a \u2018rest period\u2019 without \ntreatment. The duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). You might receive up to 8 cycles \n\n(24 weeks). \n\nThe following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each bortezomib  21-day treatment cycle as \nintravenous infusions: \n\nRituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. \n\nPrednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the bortezomib treatment cycle. \n \n\nHow bortezomib is given \n\nThis medicine is for intravenous use only. Bortezomib will be administered by a health care \n\nprofessional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines. \nBortezomib powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare \n\nprofessional. The resulting solution is then injected into a vein rapidly, over 3 to 5 seconds.  \n\n \nIf you are given too much bortezomib  \n\nAs this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too \n\nmuch. \nIn the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some \n\nof these effects may be serious. \nIf you are given bortezomib for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, tell your doctor \n\nstraight away if you notice any of the following symptoms: \n\n- muscle cramping, muscle weakness \n- confusion, visual loss or disturbances, blindness, seizures, headaches \n- shortness of breath, swelling of your feet or changes in your heart beat, high blood pressure, \n\ntiredness, fainting \n\n- coughing and breathing difficulties or tightness in the chest. \n \n\nTreatment with bortezomib can very commonly cause a decrease in the numbers of red and white \n\nblood cells and platelets in your blood. Therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before \nand during your treatment with bortezomib, to check your blood cell counts regularly. You may \n\nexperience a reduction in the number of: \n\n- platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious \ninjury (e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or  \nbleeding from the liver) \n\n- red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness \n- white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms. \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you are given bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma the side effects you may get are \nlisted below: \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n\u2022 Sensitivity, numbness, tingling or burning sensation of the skin, or pain in the hands or feet, \ndue to nerve damage \n\n\u2022 Reduction in the number of red blood cells and or white blood cells (see above) \n\n\u2022 Fever \n\n\u2022 Feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting, loss of appetite \n\n\u2022 Constipation with or without bloating (can be severe) \n\n\u2022 Diarrhoea: if this happens, it is important that you drink more water than usual.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n1. What Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called \u2018proteasome inhibitor\u2019. \n\nProteasomes play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with \ntheir function, bortezomib can kill cancer cells. \n\n \n\nBortezomib is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients \nolder than 18 years: \n\n- alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, for \npatients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior treatment \nand for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is unsuitable. \n\n- in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease has \nnot been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem \n\ncell transplantation. \n- in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with \n\nthalidomide, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before receiving \n\nhigh-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction treatment). \n \n\nBortezomib is used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph \n\nnodes) in patients 18 years or older in combination with the medicines rituximab, \n\ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously \ntreated and for whom blood stem cell transplantation is unsuitable. \n\n \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you use Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n\n \n\nDo not use bortezomib  \n\n- if you are allergic to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6) \n\n- if you have certain severe lung or heart problems. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you have any of the following: \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n\u2022 low numbers of red or white blood cells \n\n\u2022 bleeding problems and/or low number of platelets in your blood \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting \n\n\u2022 fainting, dizziness or light-headedness in the past \n\n\u2022 kidney problems \n\n\u2022 moderate to severe liver problems \n\n\u2022 numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet (neuropathy) in the past \n\n\u2022 heart or blood pressure problems \n\n\u2022 shortness of breath or cough \n\n\u2022 seizures \n\n\u2022 shingles (localised including around the eyes or spread across the body) \n\n\u2022 symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome such as muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, \nvisual loss or disturbances and shortness of breath \n\n\u2022 memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty with walking or loss of vision. These may be signs \nof a serious brain infection and your doctor may suggest further testing and follow-up. \n\n \n\nYou will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with bortezomib, to \n\ncheck your blood cell counts regularly. \n \n\nIf you have mantle cell lymphoma and are given the medicine rituximab with bortezomib you must \n\ntell your doctor: \n\n\u2022 if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, \npatients who have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be \n\nfatal. If you have a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your \n\ndoctor for signs of active hepatitis B. \n\n \nYou must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with \n\nbortezomib for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with bortezomib. \n\nWhen thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is \nneeded (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThis medicine must not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how it will \naffect them. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and bortezomib  \n\nPlease tell your doctor, or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active \nsubstances: \n\n- ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections \n- ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection \n- rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections \n- carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat epilepsy \n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), used for depression or other conditions \n- oral antidiabetics \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou must not use this medicine if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary. \n \n\nBoth men and women receiving bortezomib must use effective contraception during and for up to 3 \n\nmonths after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nYou must not breast-feed while using bortezomib. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to \n\nrestart breast-feeding after finishing your treatment. \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\nThalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When bortezomib is given in combination with \nthalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package \n\nleaflet for thalidomide). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n\nBortezomib might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate \n\ntools or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you must still be cautious. \n\n \n \n\n3. How to use Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi  \n\n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of bortezomib according to your height and weight (body \n\nsurface area). The usual starting dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week. \n\nYour doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your \n\nresponse to the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying \nconditions (e.g. liver problems). \n\n \n\nProgressive multiple myeloma \nWhen bortezomib is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of bortezomib intravenously or \n\nsubcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day \u2018rest period\u2019 without treatment. This \n\n21-day period (3 weeks) corresponds to one treatment cycle. You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 \nweeks). \n\n \n\nYou may also be given bortezomib together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or \n\ndexamethasone. \n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive \n\nbortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal \ndoxorubicin 30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as an \n\nintravenous infusion after the bortezomib injection. \n\nYou might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously \n\nor subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 1, \n\n2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, of the bortezomib, 21-day treatment cycle. \nYou might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated multiple myeloma \nIf you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem \n\ncell transplantation you will receive bortezomib together with two other medicines; melphalan and \n\nprednisone. \n\nIn this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles \n(54 weeks). \n\n\u2022 In cycles 1 to 4, bortezomib is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and \n32. \n\n\u2022 In cycles 5 to 9, bortezomib is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. \nMelphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the \nfirst week of each cycle. \n\n \n\nIf you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell \ntransplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously together with the \n\nmedicines dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment. \n\n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously \nor subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle. \n\nYou will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks). \n \n\nWhen bortezomib is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of a \n\ntreatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). \n \n\nDexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 28-day \n\ntreatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if \n\ntolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased \nto 200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards. \n\nYou might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \nPreviously untreated mantle cell lymphoma \n\nIf you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive bortezomib \n\nintravenously or subcutaneously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, \n\ndoxorubicin and prednisone. \nBortezomib is given intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a \u2018rest \n\nperiod\u2019 without treatment. The duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). You might \n\nreceive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \nThe following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each bortezomib  21-day treatment cycle as \n\nintravenous infusions: \n\nRituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. \nPrednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the bortezomib treatment cycle. \n\n \n\nHow bortezomib is given \n\nThis medicine is for intravenous or subcutaneous use. Bortezomib will be administered by a health \ncare professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines. \n\nBortezomib powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare \n\nprofessional. The resulting solution is then either injected into a vein or under the skin. Injection \ninto a vein is rapid, taking 3 to 5 seconds. Injection under the skin is in either the thighs or the \n\nabdomen. \n\n \nIf you are given too much bortezomib  \n\nAs this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too \n\nmuch. \n\nIn the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. \n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some \n\nof these effects may be serious. \n\nIf you are given bortezomib for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, tell your doctor \nstraight away if you notice any of the following symptoms: \n\n- muscle cramping, muscle weakness \n- confusion, visual loss or disturbances, blindness, seizures, headaches \n- shortness of breath, swelling of your feet or changes in your heart beat, high blood pressure, \n\ntiredness, fainting \n\n- coughing and breathing difficulties or tightness in the chest. \n \n\nTreatment with bortezomib can very commonly cause a decrease in the numbers of red and white \n\nblood cells and platelets in your blood. Therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before \n\nand during your treatment with bortezomib, to check your blood cell counts regularly. You may \nexperience a reduction in the number of: \n\n- platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious \ninjury \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\n(e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or  \n\nbleeding from the liver) \n- red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness \n- white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms. \n\n \nIf you are given bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma the side effects you may get are \n\nlisted below: \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n\u2022 Sensitivity, numbness, tingling or burning sensation of the skin, or pain in the hands or feet, \ndue to nerve damage \n\n\u2022 Reduction in the number of red blood cells and or white blood cells (see above) \n\n\u2022 Fever \n\n\u2022 Feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting, loss of appetite \n\n\u2022 Constipation with or without bloating (can be severe) \n\n\u2022 Diarrhoea: if this happens, it is important that you drink more water than usual.

DISPOSAL \n\n \n\nA vial is for single use only and the remaining solution must be discarded. \n\nAny unused product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\nOnly the 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg vial can be administered subcutaneously, as described below. \n \n\n \n\n1. RECONSTITUTION FOR SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION \n\n \nNote: Bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent. Therefore, caution must be used during handling and \n\npreparation. Use of gloves and other protective clothing to prevent skin contact is recommended. \n\n \nASEPTIC TECHNIQUE MUST BE STRICTLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT HANDLING OF \n\nBORTEZOMIB SINCE NO PRESERVATIVE IS PRESENT. \n\n \n1.1 Preparation of the 2.5 mg vial: carefully add 1 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium \n\nchloride solution for injection to the vial containing the bortezomib by using a syringe of the \n\nappropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised powder is \n\ncompleted in less than 2 minutes. \n \n\nPreparation of the 3.5 mg vial: carefully add 1.4 ml of sterile, sodium chloride \n\n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to the vial containing the bortezomib powder by using \na syringe of the appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the \n\nlyophilised powder is completed in less than 2 minutes. \n\n \nThe concentration of the resulting solution will be 2.5 mg/ml. The solution will be clear and \n\ncolourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution. \n\n \n\n1.2 Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. \nIf any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution must be discarded. Be \n\nsure that the correct dose is being given for the subcutaneous route of administration \n\n(2.5 mg/ml). \n \n\n1.3 The chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution has been \n\ndemonstrated at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml for 96 hours at 25\u00b0C and 8 days at \n\n2-8\u00b0C, when stored in the original vial and/or a syringe.  \n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately \n\nafter preparation. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user. The total storage time for the reconstituted medicinal \n\nproduct should not exceed 96 hours (if stored at 25\u00b0C) and 8 days (if stored at 2-8 \u00b0C) prior \n\nto administration. \n \n\nIt is not necessary to protect the reconstituted medicinal product from light. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n2. ADMINISTRATION \n\n \n\n\u2022 Once dissolved, withdraw the appropriate amount of the reconstituted solution according to \ncalculated dose based upon the patient\u00b4s Body Surface Area. \n\n\u2022 Confirm the dose and concentration in the syringe prior to use. (check that the syringe is \nmarked as subcutaneous administration). \n\n\u2022 Inject the solution subcutaneously, under a 45-90\u00b0angle. \n\n\u2022 The reconstituted solution is administered subcutaneously through the thighs (right or left) or \nabdomen (right or left). \n\n\u2022 Injection sites must be rotated for successive injections. \n\n\u2022 If local injection site reactions occur following bortezomib injection subcutaneously, either a \nless concentrated bortezomib solution (1 mg/ml instead of 2.5 mg/ml) may be administered \n\nsubcutaneously or a switch to intravenous injection is recommended. \n\n \n\nBortezomib Fresenius Kabi 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg IS FOR SUBCUTANEOUS OR \n\nINTRAVENOUS USE. Do not give by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in \n\ndeath. \n\n \n \n\n3. DISPOSAL \n\n \nA vial is for single use only and the remaining solution must be discarded. \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week. your doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response to the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver problems). progressive multiple myeloma when bortezomib is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of bortezomib intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day 'rest period' without treatment. this 21-day period (3 weeks) corresponds to one treatment cycle. you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). you may also be given bortezomib together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone. when bortezomib is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive bortezomib intravenously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous infusion after the bortezomib injection. you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). when bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, of the bortezomib, 21-day treatment cycle. you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). previously untreated multiple myeloma if you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem cell transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously together with two other medicines; melphalan and prednisone. in this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). you will receive 9 cycles (54 weeks). in cycles 1 to 4, bortezomib is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32. in cycles 5 to 9, bortezomib is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first week of each cycle. if you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously together with the medicines dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment. when bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle. you will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks). when bortezomib is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of a treatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 28-day treatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased to 200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards. you might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks). previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma if you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive bortezomib intravenously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone. bortezomib is given intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 'rest period' without treatment. the duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). the following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. prednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the bortezomib treatment cycle. how bortezomib is given this medicine is for intravenous use only. bortezomib will be administered by a health care professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines. bortezomib powder has to be dissolved before administration. this will be done by a healthcare professional. the resulting solution is then injected into a vein rapidly, over 3 to 5 seconds. if you are given too much bortezomib as this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. in the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "bortezomib fresenius kabi", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 1, "BeginOffset": 39, "EndOffset":

blood cell counts regularly. you may experience a reduction in the number of: - platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious injury (e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or bleeding from the liver) - red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness - white blood cells may
