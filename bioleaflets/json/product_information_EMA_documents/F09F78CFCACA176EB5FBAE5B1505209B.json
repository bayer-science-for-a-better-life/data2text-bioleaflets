ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: \n\naspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal.\nb   If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive \n\ntherapy. Upon resolution (Grade 0), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 \n\nmonth, after which IMFINZI can be resumed based on clinical judgment.\nc   Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if adverse reaction does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there \n\nare signs of respiratory insufficiency.\nd   For myasthenia gravis, if there are signs of muscular weakness or respiratory insufficiency, IMFINZI should \n\nbe permanently discontinued. \n\nFor suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to \nconfirm etiology or exclude alternate etiologies. Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or \nusing additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is worsening or no improvement. Upon \nimprovement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month.\nAfter withhold, IMFINZI can be resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions improved to \n≤ Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.\nIMFINZI should be permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) \nimmune-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nFor non-immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider withholding IMFINZI for Grade 2 and 3 \nadverse reactions until ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. IMFINZI should be discontinued for Grade 4 adverse \nreactions (with the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to \ndiscontinue should be based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment)\n\n\n\n6\n\nSpecial populations\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of IMFINZI in children and adolescents aged below 18 years of age have not \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.1). Data on \npatients aged 75 years of age or older are limited.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of IMFINZI is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nData from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population\n(see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nData from patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited. Due to minor \ninvolvement of hepatic processes in the clearance of durvalumab no dose adjustment of IMFINZI is \nrecommended for patients with hepatic impairment as no difference in exposure is expected (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nIMFINZI is for intravenous use. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion solution over 1 \nhour (see section 6.6).\n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic \ncorticosteroids and with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI. \n\nRadiation pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and \nthe clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the PACIFIC \nStudy, in patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation \nwithin 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the trial, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 161 \n(33.9%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 58 (24.8%) in the placebo group, including Grade \n3 (3.4% vs. 3.0%) and Grade 5 (1.1% vs. 1.7%) (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis. \nSuspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and \ndisease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated hepatitis\nImmune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear \nalternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI, and as \n\n\n\n7\n\nindicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hepatitis should be managed as\nrecommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated colitis\nImmune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no \nclear alternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of colitis or diarrhoea and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated endocrinopathies\nImmune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis\nImmune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis occurred in patients receiving \nIMFINZI, and hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for abnormal thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as \nindicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and \nthyroiditis should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated adrenal insufficiency\nImmune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For \nsymptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus\nImmune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. For \nsymptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated hypophysitis/hypopituitarism\nImmune-mediated hypophysitis or hypopituitarism occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or \nhypopituitarism. For symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as \nrecommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated nephritis\nImmune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear \nalternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI\nand managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated rash\nImmune-mediated rash or dermatitis (including pemphigoid), defined as requiring use of systemic \ncorticosteroids and with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see \nsection 4.8). Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in \npatients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or \ndermatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nOther immune-mediated adverse reactions\nGiven the mechanism of action of IMFINZI, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions may \noccur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have been observed in patients treated with \nIMFINZI monotherapy: myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, \nencephalitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Events of pancreatitis have been reported in patients in the \nclinical study programme. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as \nrecommended for other immune-mediated adverse reactions, in section 4.2.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\n\n\n\n8\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Severe infusion-\nrelated reactions have been reported in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Infusion-related \nreactions should be managed as recommended in section 4.2\n\nPatients excluded from clinical trials\nPatients with the following were excluded from clinical trials: a baseline ECOG performance score \n≥ 2; active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history \nof immunodeficiency; a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that \nrequired systemic immunosuppression, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids \n(≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent); uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses; active tuberculosis or \nhepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or \nafter the start of IMFINZI. In the absence of data, durvalumab should be used with caution in these \npopulations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.\nThe safety of concurrent prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) with IMFINZI in patients with ES-\nSCLC is unknown.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting durvalumab, except \nphysiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not \nrecommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy \nof durvalumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after\nstarting durvalumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).\n\nNo formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab.\nSince the primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial \nsystem or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. PK drug-drug \ninteraction between durvalumab and chemotherapy was assessed in the CASPIAN study and showed \nconcomitant treatment with durvalumab did not impact the PK of etoposide, carboplatin or cisplatin. \nAdditionally, based on population PK analysis, concomitant chemotherapy treatment did not\nmeaningfully impact the PK of durvalumab.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with\ndurvalumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data on the use of durvalumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, \ndurvalumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy, and in a mouse allogeneic \npregnancy model, disruption of PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. \nAnimal studies with durvalumab are not indicative of reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human \nIgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and placental transfer of durvalumab was confirmed in \nanimal studies. Durvalumab may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is not \nrecommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective \ncontraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether durvalumab is secreted in human breast milk. Available toxicological data in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown low levels of durvalumab in breast milk on Day 28 after birth (see \nsection 5.3). In humans, antibodies may be transferred to breast milk, but the potential for absorption \nand harm to the newborn is unknown. However, a potential risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue or abstain\nfrom durvalumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit \nof therapy for the woman.\n\n\n\n9\n\nFertility\nThere are no data on the potential effects of durvalumab on fertility in humans or animals. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDurvalumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety of IMFINZI as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 3006 patients across multiple \ntumour types. IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 20 mg/kg every 4 \nweeks. The most frequent (>10%) adverse reactions were cough/productive cough (21.5%), diarrhoea \n(16.3%), rash (16.0%), pyrexia (13.8%), upper respiratory tract infections (13.5%), abdominal pain \n(12.7%), pruritus (10.8%), and hypothyroidism (10.1%).\n\nThe safety of IMFINZI given in combination with chemotherapy is based on data in 265 patients with \nSCLC. IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 1500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with \nchemotherapy followed by monotherapy every 4 weeks. The most frequent (>20%) adverse reactions \nwere neutropenia (48.7%), anaemia (38.5%), nausea (33.6%), fatigue (32.1%), alopecia (31.3%), \nthrombocytopenia (21.1%), and leukopenia (20.0%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 3 lists the incidence of adverse reactions in the monotherapy safety dataset and in patients \ntreated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy in the CASPIAN study. Adverse drug \nreactions are listed according to system organ class in MedDRA. Within each system organ class, the \nadverse drug reactions are presented in decreasing frequency. The corresponding frequency category \nfor each ADR is defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 3.

Most of these, \nincluding severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal \nof IMFINZI. The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions reflect the combined \nsafety database of 3006 patients which includes the PACIFIC Study and additional studies in patients\nwith various solid tumours, in indications for which durvalumab is not approved. Across all studies, \nIMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, or 1500 mg \nevery 3 or 4 weeks. Details for the significant adverse reactions for IMFINZI when given in \ncombination with chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in \ncomparison to IMFINZI monotherapy. The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are \ndescribed in section 4.4.\n\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, (n = 3006 multiple tumour types), \nimmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 107 (3.6%) patients, including Grade 3 in 23 (0.8%) \npatients, Grade 4 in 2 (< 0.1%) patients, and Grade 5 in 6 (0.2%) patients. The median time to onset \nwas 57 days (range: 2-785 days). Sixty-four of the 107 patients received high-dose corticosteroid \ntreatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day), 2 patients also received infliximab and 1 \npatient also received cyclosporine. IMFINZI was discontinued in 38 patients. Resolution occurred in \n58 patients. \n\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients in the PACIFIC Study who had \ncompleted treatment with concurrent chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study \n(10.7%), than in the other patients in the combined safety database (2.2%).\n\nIn the PACIFIC Study, (n = 475 in the IMFINZI arm, and n = 234 in the placebo arm) \nimmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 51 (10.7%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 16 \n(6.8%) patients in the placebo group, including Grade 3 in 8 (1.7%) patients on IMFINZI vs. 6 (2.6%)\npatients on placebo and Grade 5 (fatal) in 4 (0.8%) patients on IMFINZI vs. 3 (1.3%) patients on \nplacebo. The median time to onset in the IMFINZI-treated group was 53 days (range: 1-341 days) vs. \n55.5 days (range: 0-231 days) in the placebo group. In the IMFINZI-treated group, 44 of the 51 \npatients received systemic corticosteroids, including 28 patients who received high-dose corticosteroid \ntreatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day), and 2 patients also received infliximab. In \nthe placebo group, 11 of the 16 patients received systemic corticosteroids, including 9 patients who\nreceived high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). \nResolution occurred for 27 patients in the IMFINZI treated group vs. 6 in placebo.\n\nImmune-mediated hepatitis\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in \n36 (1.2%) patients, including Grade 3 in 19 (0.6%) patients, Grade 4 in 1 (<0.1%) patients and Grade 5\n(fatal) in 2 (<0.1%) patients. The median time to onset was 67 days (range: 7-333 days). Twenty-five \nof the 36 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent \nper day). Two patients also received mycophenolate treatment. IMFINZI was discontinued in 7\npatients. Resolution occurred in 22 patients.\n\nImmune-mediated colitis\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea\noccurred in 52 (1.7%) patients, including Grade 3 in 9 (0.3%) patients and Grade 4 in 2 (<0.1%) \npatients. The median time to onset was 73 days (range: 1-394 days). Thirty-four of the 52 patients \nreceived high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). One \npatient also received infliximab treatment and 1 patient also received mycophenolate. IMFINZI was \ndiscontinued in 9 patients. Resolution occurred in 39 patients.\n\n\n\n13\n\nImmune-mediated endocrinopathies\nImmune-mediated hypothyroidism\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hypothyroidism \noccurred in 222 (7.4%) patients, including Grade 3 in 4 (0.1%) patients.

Resolution occurred in \n3 patients.\n\nImmune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated type 1 diabetes \nmellitus occurred in 1 (<0.1%) patient, (Grade 3). The time to onset was 43 days. The patient received \nendocrine therapy and discontinued IMFINZI due to immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus. The \nevent resolved for the patient.\n\nImmune mediated hypophysitis/hypopituitarism\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hypophysitis/\nhypopituitarism occurred in 2 (<0.1%) patients, both Grade 3. The time to onset for the events was 44 \ndays and 50 days. Both patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone \nor equivalent per day) and one patient discontinued IMFINZI due to immune-mediated \nhypophysitis/hypopituitarism.\n\nImmune-mediated nephritis \nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated nephritis occurred in \n9 (0.3%) patients, including Grade 3 in 2 (< 0.1%) patients. The median time to onset was 87 days \n(range: 29-393 days). Six (0.2%) patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day) and 1 patient also received mycophenolate. IMFINZI was \ndiscontinued in 5 patients. Resolution occurred in 6 patients.\n\n\n\n14\n\nImmune-mediated rash\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated rash or dermatitis \n(including pemphigoid) occurred in 45 (1.5%) patients, including Grade 3 in 12 (0.4%) patients. The \nmedian time to onset was 41 days (range: 4-333 days). Twenty of the 45 patients received high-dose \ncorticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). IMFINZI was discontinued \nin 3 patients. Resolution occurred in 31 patients.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 49\n(1.6%) patients, including Grade 3 in 5 (0.2%) patients. There were no Grade 4 or 5 events.\n\nLaboratory abnormalities\nIn patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a shift \nfrom baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 2.4% for alanine \naminotransferase increased, 3.6% for aspartate aminotransferase increased, 0.5% for blood creatinine \nincreased, 5.7% for amylase increased and 5.6% for lipase increased. The proportion of patients who \nexperienced a TSH shift from baseline that was ≤ ULN to any grade > ULN was 18.8% and a TSH \nshift from baseline that was ≥ LLN to any grade < LLN was 18.1%.\n\nIn patients treated with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy, the proportion of patients who \nexperienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 4.9% for \nalanine aminotransferase increased, 4.6% for aspartate aminotransferase increased, 3.4% for blood \ncreatinine increased, 4.8% for amylase increased and 8.1% for lipase increased. The proportion of \npatients who experienced a TSH shift from baseline that was ≤ ULN to any grade > ULN was 17.7% \nand a TSH shift from baseline that was ≥ LLN to any grade < LLN was 31.3%.\n\nImmunogenicity \nImmunogenicity of IMFINZI as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 2280 patients who were \ntreated with IMFINZI 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks as a single-agent and \nevaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Sixty nine patients (3.0%) tested positive for \ntreatment emergent ADA. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) against durvalumab were detected in 0.5% \n(12/2280) of patients. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically relevant effect on safety. There \nare insufficient number of patients to determine ADA impact on efficacy. Based on population PK \nanalysis, slightly lower exposure are expected in ADA-positive patients however, the reduction of PK \nexposure is less than 30% compared to a typical patient and is not considered clinically relevant.\n\nIn the CASPIAN study, of 201 patients who were treated with IMFINZI 1500 mg every 3 weeks in \ncombination with chemotherapy and evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 0 (0%) patients tested \npositive for treatment-emergent ADAs. The impact of treatment-emergent ADA on PK, clinical safety \nand efficacy of durvalumab was not evaluable as no patient samples tested positive for treatment-\nemergent durvalumab ADA.\n\nElderly\nNo overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. Data \nfrom NSCLC and ES-SCLC patients 75 years of age or older are limited.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nThere is no information on overdose with durvalumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely \nmonitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment \ninstituted immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC28\n\nMechanism of action\nExpression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that \nhelps tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 can be induced by \ninflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and \ntumour-associated immune cells in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and \nactivation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces \ncytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation and cytokine production.\n\nDurvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that \nselectively blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Durvalumab does not induce \nantibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Selective blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and \nPD-L1/CD80 interactions enhances antitumour immune responses and increases T-cell activation. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nNSCLC – PACIFIC Study\nThe efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC Study, a randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multicentre study in 713 patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. \nPatients had completed at least 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemotherapy with radiation \ntherapy within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study and had a ECOG performance status of 0 or \n1. Ninety-two percent of patients had received a total dose of 54 to 66 Gy of radiation. The study \nexcluded patients who had progressed following chemoradiation therapy, patients with prior exposure \nto any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody, patients with active or prior documented autoimmune \ndisease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history of immunodeficiency; a history of severe \nimmune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression, \nexcept physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV \ninfection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of \nIMFINZI. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 10 mg/kg IMFINZI (n = 476) or 10 mg/kg placebo \n(n = 237) via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or \nconfirmed disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by gender, age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 \nyears) and smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker). Patients with disease control at 12 months were \ngiven the option to be re-treated upon disease progression. Tumour assessments were conducted every \n8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nPatients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 expression level. Where available, archival \ntumour tissue specimens taken prior to chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively tested for PD-L1 \nexpression on tumour cells (TC) using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) IHC assay. Of the 713 patients \nrandomised, 63% of patients provided a tissue sample of sufficient quality and quantity to determine \nPD-L1 expression and 37% were unknown.\n\nThe demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. \nBaseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (70%), age ≥ 65 years \n(45%), age ≥ 75 years (8%), White (69%), Asian (27%), other (4%), current smoker (16%), \npast-smoker (75%), never smoker (9%), ECOG Performance Status 0 (49%), ECOG Performance \nStatus 1 (51%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IIIA (53%), Stage IIIB (45%), \nhistological sub-groups of squamous (46%), non-squamous (54%). Of 451 patients with PD L1 \n\n\n\n16\n\nexpression available, 67% were TC ≥ 1% [PD-L1 TC 1-24% (32%), PD L1 TC ≥ 25% (35%)] and \n33% were TC < 1%.\n\nThe two primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) \nof IMFINZI vs. placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS at 12 months (PFS 12) and 18 \nmonths (PFS 18) from randomisation and Time from Randomisation to Second Progression (PFS2). \nPFS was assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.\n\nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the IMFINZI-treated group \ncompared with the placebo group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.65), p < 0.0001]. The \nstudy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in the IMFINZI-treated group\ncompared with the placebo group [HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.87), p = 0.00251].

The LC13 and C30 were \nassessed at baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks until completion \nof the treatment period or discontinuation of IMFINZI due to toxicity or disease progression. \nCompliance was similar between the IMFINZI and placebo treatment groups (83% vs. 85.1% overall \nof evaluable forms completed).\n\nAt baseline, no differences in patient-reported symptoms, function and HRQoL were observed \nbetween IMFINZI and placebo groups. Throughout the duration of the study to Week 48, there was no \nclinically meaningful difference between IMFINZI and placebo groups in symptoms, functioning and \nHRQoL (as assessed by a difference of greater than or equal to 10 points).\n\nSCLC – CASPIAN Study\nCASPIAN was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI with or without tremelimumab in \ncombination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin. CASPIAN was a randomized, open-\nlabel, multicentre study in 805 treatment naïve ES-SCLC patients with WHO/ECOG Performance \nstatus of 0 or 1, body weight >30 kg, suitable to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as \nfirst-line treatment for SCLC, with life expectancy ≥12 weeks, at least one target lesion by RECIST \n1.1 and adequate organ and bone marrow function. Patients with asymptomatic or treated brain \nmetastases were eligible. The study excluded patients with a history of chest radiation therapy; a \nhistory of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders including paraneoplastic \nsyndrome (PNS); active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of systemic \nimmunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment except physiological dose of \nsystemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving \nlive attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI.\n\nRandomisation was stratified by the planned platinum-based (carboplatin or cisplatin) therapy in cycle \n1. \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:\n\n Arm 1: IMFINZI 1500 mg + tremelimumab 75 mg + etoposide and either carboplatin or \ncisplatin\n\n Arm 2: IMFINZI 1500 mg + etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin\n Arm 3: Either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m2) on Day 1 and \n\netoposide (80-100 mg/m2) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for between \n4 – 6 cycles.\n\nFor patients randomised to Arm 1 and 2, etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin was limited to 4 \ncycles on an every 3 week schedule subsequent to randomisation. IMFINZI monotherapy continued\nevery 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of IMFINZI\nmonotherapy was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and \nderiving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator.\n\nPatients randomised to Arm 3 were permitted to receive a total of up to 6 cycles of etoposide and \neither carboplatin or cisplatin. After completion of etoposide + platinum, PCI was permitted only in \nArm 3 per investigator discretion.\n\nTumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomization, and then \nevery 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted \nevery 2 months following treatment discontinuation.\n\nThe primary endpoints of the study were Overall Survival (OS) of IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum\n(Arm 2) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3) and IMFINZI + tremelimumab + etoposide + \nplatinum (Arm 1) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3). The key secondary endpoint was \n\n\n\n21\n\nprogression-free survival (PFS). Other secondary endpoints were Objective Response Rate (ORR), OS \nand PFS landmarks and Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO). PFS and ORR were assessed using \nInvestigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1. \n\nThe demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms\n(268 patients in Arm 2 and 269 patients in Arm 3). Baseline demographics of the overall study \npopulation were as follows: male (69.6%), age ≥ 65 years (39.6%), median age 63 years (range: 28 to \n82 years), white (83.8%), Asian (14.5%), black or African American (0.9%), other (0.6 %), \nnon-Hispanic or Latino (96.1%), current or past-smoker (93.1%), never smoker (6.9%), WHO/ECOG \nPS 0 (35.2%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (64.8%), Stage IV 90.3%, 24.6% of the patients received cisplatin\nand 74.1% of the patients received carboplatin. In Arm 3, 56.8% of the patients received 6 cycles of \netoposide + platinum and 7.8% of the patients received PCI.   \n\nAt a planned interim (primary) analysis the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement \nin OS with IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3) \n[HR=0.73 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.909), p=0.0047]. Although not formally tested for significance, IMFINZI \n+ etoposide + platinum demonstrated an improvement in PFS vs. etoposide + platinum alone\n[HR=0.78 (95% CI: 0.645, 0.936)].\n\nIn the planned follow-up analysis (median: 25.1 months), IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) \nvs. etoposide + platinum (Arm 3) continued to demonstrate improved OS. The OS, PFS, ORR and \nDoR results from the planned follow-up analysis are summarized in Table 5; Kaplan-Meier curves for \nOS and PFS are presented in Figures 7 and 8.\n\nTable 5.

PK \nexposure increased more than dose-proportionally (non-linear PK) at doses < 3 mg/kg, and dose \nproportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. \nBased on population PK analysis that included 1878 patients who received durvalumab monotherapy\nin the dose range of  ≥ 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the geometric mean steady state volume of \ndistribution (Vss) was 5.64 L. Durvalumab clearance (CL) decreased over time resulting in a geometric \nmean steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.16 mL/h at Day 365; the decrease in CLss was not considered \nclinically relevant. The terminal half-life (t1/2), based on baseline CL, was approximately 18 days.\nThere was no clinically meaningful difference between the PK of durvalumab as a single agent and in \ncombination with chemotherapy. The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein \ncatabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.\n\nMedian PFS (95% CI)\n\nIMFINZI + etoposide + platinum 5.1 (4.7, 6.2)\n\netoposide + platinum 5.4 (4.8, 6.2)\n\nTime from randomisation (months)\n\nIMFINZI+etoposide+platinum\n\ncensored\n\netoposide+platinum\n\nNumber of patients at risk 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33\n\nIMFINZI + etoposide + platinum 268 220 119 55 45 40 35 24 18 8 5 0\n\netoposide + platinum 269 195 110 33 12 9 7 7 6 1 0 0\n\nP\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nli\nty\n\n o\nf \n\nP\nF\n\nS\n\nHazard Ratio (95% CI)\n\nIMFINZI + etoposide + platinum vs. etoposide + platinum: 0.80 (0.665, 0.959)\n\n\n\n24\n\nSpecial populations\nAge (19–96 years), body weight (31-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, \nalbumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1, tumour type, race or ECOG status had \nno clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nMild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 mL/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.The \neffect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 mL/min) on the PK of durvalumab is unknown.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nMild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any \nAST) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The effect of moderate hepatic \nimpairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin \n> 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown; however, as IgG \nmonoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is \nnot expected to influence durvalumab exposure.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity\nThe carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab has not been evaluated.\n\nReproductive toxicology\nAs reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by \nmaintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus, and in mouse allogeneic pregnancy models \ndisruption of PD-L1 signalling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. In animal reproduction \nstudies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of \npregnancy through delivery, at exposure levels approximately 18 times higher than those observed at \nthe clinical dose of 10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC), was associated with placental transfer \nbut not with maternal toxicity or effects on embryofoetal development, pregnancy outcome or \npostnatal development. Negligible levels of durvalumab was found in milk of cynomolgous monkey \non Day 28 after birth.\n\n6.
