NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue 5 mg/ml solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml of solution contains 5 mg methylthioninium chloride. \n\nEach 10 ml ampoule contains 50 mg methylthioninium chloride. \n\nEach 2 ml ampoule contains 10 mg methylthioninium chloride. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection (injection)  \n\nClear dark blue solution with a pH value between 3.0 and 4.5 \n\nOsmolality is usually between 10 and 15 mOsm/kg.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAcute symptomatic treatment of medicinal and chemical products-induced methaemoglobinaemia.  \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue is indicated in adults, children and adolescents (aged 0 to \n\n17 years old). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue is for administration by a healthcare professional.   \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose is 1 to 2 mg per kg body weight, i.e. 0.2-0.4 ml per kg body weight, given over a \n\nperiod of 5 minutes.  \n\nA repeat dose (1 to 2 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.2-0.4 ml/kg body weight) may be given one hour after \n\nthe first dose in cases of persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain \n\nsignificantly higher than the normal clinical range. \n\nTreatment does not usually exceed one day. \n\nThe maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 7 mg/kg and should not be \n\nexceeded, since Methylthioninium chloride administered above the maximum dose may cause \n\nmethaemoglobinaemia in susceptible patients.  \n\nIn the case of aniline- or dapsone-induced methaemaglobinaemia, the maximum recommended \n\ncumulative dose for the course of treatment is 4 mg/kg (see section 4.4).  \n\nToo limited data are available to support a continuous infusion dose recommendation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal \n\ndisease since there is limited data available and methylthioninium chloride is predominantly renally \n\neliminated. Lower doses (<1 mg/kg) may be needed.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThere is no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nInfants above 3 months, children and adolescents:  \n\nSame posology as for adults.  \n\nInfants 3 months old or younger and newborn infants:  \n\nThe recommended dose is 0.3-0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06 to 0.1 ml/kg body weight, given over a \n\nperiod of 5 minutes. \n\nA repeat dose (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06-0.1 ml/kg body weight) may be given one hour \n\nafter the first dose in cases of persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain \n\nsignificantly higher than the normal clinical range (see section 4.4 for important safety information). \n\nTreatment does not usually exceed one day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nFor intravenous use. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue is hypotonic and may be diluted in 50 ml glucose 50 mg/ml \n\n(5%) solution for injection to avoid local pain, in particular in paediatric population. \n\nIt must be injected very slowly over a period of 5 minutes. \n\nIt must not be administered by subcutaneous or intrathecal injection. \n\nFor instructions on handling and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section \n\n6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any other thiazine dyes \n\n• Patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) due to the risk of \nhaemolytic anaemia \n\n• Patients with nitrite-induced methaemoglobinaemia during treatment of cyanide poisoning \n\n• Patients with methaemoglobinaemia due to chlorate poisoning \n\n• Deficiency in NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) reductase. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue must be injected very slowly over a period of 5 minutes to \n\nprevent high local concentrations of the compound from producing additional methaemoglobin.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nIt imparts a blue-green colour to urine, faeces and a blue colour to skin which may hinder a diagnosis \n\nof cyanosis. \n\nIn patients with aniline-induced methaemoglobinaemia, repeated doses of methylthioninium chloride \n\nmay be required. Caution should be exercised in the course of treatment with methylthioninium \n\nchloride as this may exacerbate Heinz body formation and haemolytic anaemia. Lower doses should \n\ntherefore be considered and total cumulative dose should not exceed 4 mg/kg. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue can exacerbate dapsone-induced haemolytic anemia because of \n\nthe formation of the dapsone reactive metabolite hydroxylamine which oxidises haemoglobin. It is \n\nrecommended not to exceed a cumulative dose for the course of treatment of 4 mg/kg in patients with \n\ndapsone-induced methaemoglobinaemia. \n\nIn cases of suspected methaemoglobinaemia, it is advisable to check the oxygen saturation by co-\n\noximetry when available since pulse oximetry may provide a false estimation of oxygen saturation \n\nduring administration of methylthioninium chloride. \n\nAnaesthesiologists should be vigilant for methaemoglobinaemia in patients receiving dapsone therapy \n\nand for BIS (Bispectral Index) interference with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue administration.  \n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure should be monitored during and after treatment with \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue as hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia are potential adverse \n\nreactions (see section 4.8). \n\nFailure to respond to methylthioninium chloride suggests cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, \n\nglucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or sulfhaemoglobinemia. Alternative treatment \n\noptions should be considered. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride may cause serious or fatal serotonergic syndrome when used in \n\ncombination with serotonergic drugs. Avoid concomitant use of methylthioninium chloride with \n\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors \n\n(SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients treated with methylthioninium chloride in combination with serotonergic drugs should be \n\nmonitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, \n\ndiscontinue use of methylthioninium chloride, and initiate supportive treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients with hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus  \n\n \n\nIf diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, methylthioninium chloride must be used \n\nwith caution in patients with hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus, as these conditions may be \n\nexacerbated by the glucose solution. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nExtreme caution should be exercised when administering to newborns and infants below the age of \n\n3 months due to lower concentrations of NADPH-methaemoglobin reductase necessary for reducing \n\nmethaemoglobin to haemoglobin, making these infants more susceptible to methaemoglobinaemia \n\nproduced by high doses of methylthioninium chloride. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nMethylthioninium chloride may cause a cutaneous photosensitivity reaction when exposed to strong \n\nlight sources, such as phototherapy, those found in operating theatres or locally from illuminating \n\ndevices such as pulse oximeters. \n\nAdvise patients to take protective measures against exposure to light, because photosensitivity may \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\noccur after administration of methylthioninium chloride. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride should be avoided in patients receiving medicinal products that enhance \n\nserotonergic transmission because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, including potentially \n\nfatal serotonin syndrome. These include SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), bupropion, \n\nbuspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine. If the intravenous use of methylthioninium \n\nchloride cannot be avoided in patients treated with serotonergic medicinal products, the lowest \n\npossible dose should be chosen and the patient observed closely for central nervous system (CNS) \n\neffects for up to 4 hours after administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nMethylthioninium chloride is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5. \n\nThe clinical consequences of increases plasma concentration of co-administered drugs which are \n\nsensitive CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A substrates cannot be ruled out. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride is an in vitro inducer of CYP1A2. The clinical consequence is not known. \n\nThe administration of methylthioninium chloride Proveblue has the potential to transiently increase or \n\ndecrease the clearance of drugs that are primarily metabolized by these enzymes. The clinical \n\nconsequences are however considered minimal since methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is used \n\noften only once and in an acute emergency setting. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride is a potent inhibitor of the transporters OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. \n\nThe clinical consequences of the inhibition are not known. The administration of methylthioninium \n\nchloride Proveblue has the potential to transiently increase the exposure of drugs primarily cleared by \n\nrenal transport involving the OCT2/MATE pathway, including cimetidine, metformin and acyclovir.  \n\nMethylthioninium chloride is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The clinical consequences are \n\nconsidered likely to be minimal due to the transient and single dose use that normally occurs in the \n\nemergency setting. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of methylthioninium chloride in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, \n\ne.g. in life-threatening methaemoglobinaemia.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether methylthioninium chloride is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of \n\nmethylthioninium chloride in milk has not been studied in animals. A risk to the suckling child cannot \n\nbe excluded. Based on kinetic data, breast-feeding should be discontinued for up to 8 days after \n\ntreatment with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nIn vitro, methylthioninium chloride has been shown to reduce motility of human sperm in a dose \n\ndependant manner. \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Indeed, \n\ndriving can be affected due to confusional state, dizziness and possibly eye disturbances. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nHowever, the risk is limited as the medicinal product is intended for acute administration only in \n\nemergency situations at hospital. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions observed during clinical trials are dizziness, \n\nparaesthesia, dysgeusia, nausea, skin discoloration, chromaturia, sweating, injection site pain and pain \n\nin extremity. \n\nIntravenous injection of methylthioninium chloride has occasionally caused hypotension and cardiac \n\narrhythmias, and such disorders might prove fatal on rare occasions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed in the table below occur in adults, children and adolescents (aged 0 to \n\n17 years old) after intravenous administration. The frequencies are not known (cannot be estimated \n\nfrom the available data). When indicated, the frequency is based on a very small sample size.  \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \n\nMethaemoglobinaemia,  Not known \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia1 Not known  \n\nHaemolytic anaemia Not known \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reactions Not known \n\nPsychiatric disorders Confusional state Not known \n\nAgitation Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Dizziness Very common \n\nHeadache Common \n\nAnxiety Common \n\nTremor Not known \n\nFever Not known \n\nAphasia Not known \n\nParaesthesia Very common \n\nDysgeusia Very common \n\nSerotonin Syndrome with concomitant \n\nuse of serotonergic drugs (see section \n\n4.4 and section 4.5). \n\nNot known \n\nEye disorders Mydriasis Not known \n\nCardiac disorders Cardiac arrhythmia Not known \n\nTachycardia Not known \n\nVascular disorders Hypertension Not known \n\nHypotension Not known \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea Not known \n\nTachypnoea Not known \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nHypoxia Not known \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Very common \n\nVomiting Common \n\nAbdominal pain Common \n\nFaeces discoloration (blue-green) Not known \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nSkin discoloration (blue) Very common \n\nSweating Very common \n\nUrticaria Not known \n\nPhototoxicity / Photosensitivity Not known \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Chromaturia (blue-green) Very common \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nChest pain Common \n\nLocal tissue necrosis at the injection \n\nsite \n\nNot known \n\nInjection site pain Common \n\nInvestigations Haemoglobin decreased Not known \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorder \n\nPain in extremity Very common \n\n1 Reported in infants only \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are the same as in adults (except hyperbilirubinaemia, reported in infants only). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIndividuals without methaemoglobinaemia \n\n \n\nThe administration of large intravenous doses (≥ 7 mg/kg) of Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue to \n\nindividuals without methaemoglobinaemia induces nausea and vomiting, chest tightness, chest pain, \n\ntachycardia, apprehension, severe sweating, tremor, mydriasis, blue-green staining of the urine, blue \n\nstaining of the skin and mucous membranes, abdominal pain, dizziness, paraesthesia, headache, \n\nconfusion, hypertension, mild methaemoglobinaemia (up to 7%) and electrocardiogram changes \n\n(T wave flattening or inversion). These features resolve generally within 2-12 hours of the injection. \n\nIndividuals with methaemoglobinaemia \n\n \n\nCumulative doses of Methylthioninium chloride may lead to dyspnoea and tachypnoea, presumably \n\nrelated to reduced oxygen availability caused by methaemoglobinaemia, chest pain, tremor, cyanosis \n\nand haemolytic anaemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nHaemolytic anaemia has also been reported in case of severe overdose (20-30 mg/kg) in infants and \n\nadults with methaemoglobinaemia caused by aniline or chlorates. Haemodialysis may be used in \n\npatients with severe haemolysis. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia has been observed in infants after administration of 20 mg/kg methylthioninium \n\nchloride. \n\nDeath occurred in 2 infants after administration of 20 mg/kg methylthioninium chloride. Both infants \n\nhad complex medical circumstances and methylthioninium chloride was only partially responsible.  \n\nThe patient should be maintained under observation, the methaemoglobin level should be monitored \n\nand appropriate supportive measures taken as necessary.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, antidotes, ATC code: V03AB17 \n\nIn vivo, in low concentration, methylthioninium chloride speeds up the conversion of methaemoglobin \n\nto haemoglobin. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue has been observed to stain tissues selectively. Its use in \n\nparathyroid surgery (not indicated) has induced adverse CNS effects when administered concomitantly \n\nwith serotonergic medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of methylthioninium chloride for the treatment of methaemoglobinaemia in peadiatric \n\npopulation was demonstrated in two retrospective studies and one open randomised clinical trial. Case \n\nreports of efficacy are also available in literature. \n\nPlease refer to section 4.4 for important safety information.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAfter intravenous administration Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is rapidly taken up by the \n\ntissues. It is also well absorbed by the oral route. The majority of the dose is excreted in the urine, \n\nusually in the form of leucomethylthioninium chloride. \n\nThe estimated terminal half-life of methylthioninium chloride after intravenous administration is  \n\n26.7h.  \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue is not an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue is not an in vitro substrate for BCRP or OCT2 and is not an in \n\nvitro inhibitor of BCRP, OAT1 or OAT3. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeated dose toxicity \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nOne-month repeated dose toxicity in dogs showed no macroscopic toxic effects.  \n\nAdverse reactions, seen at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible \n\nrelevance to clinical use were moderate regenerative anaemia associated with increased mean platelet \n\ncount and fibrinogen levels, a minimal increase in mean total bilirubin blood values and an increased \n\nincidence of moderate urine bilirubin levels. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity \n\n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride was mutagenic in gene mutation assays in bacteria and mouse lymphoma \n\ncells but not in vivo mouse micronucleus assay when administered intravenously at 62 mg/kg.  \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\n \n\nSome evidence of carcinogenic activity of methylthioniniul chloride has been shown in male mice and \n\nmale rats. An equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity was observed in female mice. No evidence \n\nof carcinogenic activity was observed in female rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive Toxicology \n\n \n\nIn vitro, methylthioninium chloride has been shown to reduce motility of human sperm in a dose \n\ndependant manner. It has also been shown to inhibit the growth of cultured two-cell mouse embryos \n\nand the production of progesterone in cultured human luteal cells. \n\nIn rats and rabbits, teratogenic effects have been reported, with foetal and maternal toxicity. In rats, \n\nincreased resorption rates have been observed. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is and what it is used for  \n \n\nMethylthioninium chloride (also called methylene blue) belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantidotes. \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Proveblue will be given to you or your child (0-17 years old) to treat \n\nproblems with your blood resulting from exposure to some medicines or chemicals that can cause a \n\ndisease called methaemoglobinaemia. \n\nIn methaemoglobinaemia, your blood contains too much methaemoglobin (an abnormal form of \n\nhaemoglobin that is not able to transport oxygen around your body effectively). This medicine will \n\nhelp your haemoglobin return to normal and restore the transport of oxygen in the blood. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue     \n \n\nYou must not be given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue:   \n\n- if you are allergic to methylthioninium chloride or other thiazine dyes \n\n- if your body does not produce enough of the enzyme G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate \n\ndehydrogenase)  \n\n-  if your body does not produce enough of the enzyme NADPH (nicotinamide adenine \n\ndinucleotide phosphate) reductase \n\n- if your blood disorder has been caused by nitrite during treatment of cyanide poisoning \n\n- if your blood disorder has been caused by chlorate poisoning. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue \n\n- if you have moderate or severe renal disease; lower doses (< 1 mg/kg) may be needed  \n\n- if your blood disorder has been caused by a chemical called aniline, which is contained in dyes; \n\nlower doses may be needed and total cumulative dose should not exceed 4 mg/kg (see section 3 \n\nof this package leaflet) \n\n- if your blood disorder has been caused by a medicine called dapsone (used to treat leprosy and \n\nother skin conditions); lower doses may be needed and total cumulative dose should not exceed \n\n4 mg/kg (see section 3) \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n- if you suffer from hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus, as these conditions may be worsened by \n\nthe glucose solution used for the dilution of the medicine \n\n-  your urine and stools may turn a blue-green colour; and skin may possibly turn a blue colour \n\nwhen you are treated with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue. This discolouration is \n\nexpected and will disappear after the treatment has ended  \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, please consult your doctor. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nMethylthioninium chloride may cause a photosensitivity reaction in the skin (sunburn-like reaction) \n\nwhen exposed to strong light sources, such as light therapy, lights in operating rooms and pulse \n\noximeters. \n\nProtective measures against exposure to light should be taken. \n\n \n\nMonitoring tests \n\nYou will undergo monitoring tests during and after treatment with Methylthioninium chloride \n\nProveblue. \n\n \n\nChildren \n\nSpecial care must be taken with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue:   \n\n- in newborns and infants 3 months old or younger, lower doses are recommended (see section 3 \nof this package leaflet). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\nYou should not be given methylthioninium chloride at the same time you are taking certain medicines \n\nto treat depression or anxiety which affect a brain chemical called serotonin. When used in \n\ncombination with these medicines methylthioninium chloride may cause serotonin syndrome, which \n\ncan be potentially life-threatening. Such medicines include: \n\n• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, \nfluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and zimelidine \n\n• bupropion \n\n• buspirone \n\n• clomipramine \n\n• mirtazapine  \n\n• venlafaxine  \n\n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n\nHowever, if the intravenous use of methylthioninium chloride cannot be avoided, you should be \n\nadministered the lowest possible dose and observed closely for up to 4 hours after administration. \n\nIf you have any doubts about whether this medicine should be given to you, consult your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\nThe use of Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue during pregnancy is not recommended unless it is \n\nclearly necessary, for example in a life-threatening situation. \n\nDue to a lack of available data on whether methylthioninium chloride passes into human breast milk, \n\nbreast-feeding should be discontinued for up to 8 days after treatment with this medicine.  \n\n \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines as methylthioninium chloride has moderate influence on the \n\nability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is given     \n \n\nYour doctor will inject this medicine into a vein (intravenously) slowly over a period of 5 minutes.  \n\n \n\nAdults, children above 3 months and elderly \n\nThe usual dose is 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of your body weight, i.e. 0.2 to 0.4 ml per kilogram given \n\nover a period of 5 minutes. A second dose may be given after one hour if required.  \n\nThe maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 7 mg/kg.  \n\nIf your blood disorder has been caused by aniline or dapsone, total cumulative dose should not exceed \n\n4 mg/kg (see section 2). \n\nUsually, treatment should not exceed one day. \n\n \n\nInfants 3 months old or younger  \n\nThe recommended dose is 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06 to 0.1 ml/kg, over a period of \n\n5 minutes.  \n\nA repeat dose (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06-0.1 ml/kg) may be given after one hour in case \n\nof persistence or recurrence of symptoms. Usually, treatment should not exceed one day. \n\nThis medicine may be diluted in 50 ml glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection to avoid local \n\npain, in particular in children. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue than you should  \n\nAs this medicine will be given to you whilst you are in hospital, it is unlikely that you will be given \n\ntoo much or too little, however, tell your doctor if you notice one of the following adverse reactions:  \n\n- feeling sick, \n- stomach pain,  \n- chest pain, \n- dizziness, \n- headache, \n- sweating, \n- confusion, \n- an increase in methaemoglobin (an abnormal form of haemoglobin in the blood), \n- high blood pressure, \n- shortness of breath, \n- abnormally fast beating of the heart, \n- tremor,  \n- skin discolouration. Your skin may turn blue \n- reduction in red blood cells which may turn your skin pale and make you breathless and weak, \n- jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), this has only been reported in infants. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue can cause side effects, although not \n\neverybody gets them.  \n\nThese effects are the same in adults and children except jaundice which has only been reported in \n\ninfants. \n\n \n\n• Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n-   pain in extremity  \n\n-   dizziness \n\n-   sweating  \n\n-   skin discolouration. Your skin may turn blue \n\n-   blue or green urine \n\n-   numbness and tingling \n\n-   abnormal taste in mouth \n\n-   nausea \n\n \n\n• Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- stomach pain \n- chest pain \n-  headache \n\n-  anxiety \n\n- injection site pain \n- vomiting \n\n \n\n• Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n-  serotonin syndrome when Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue has been taken with certain \n\nmedicines to treat depression or anxiety, see section 2 \n\n-  decreased haemoglobin (protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen in the blood) levels may be \n\nreported during blood tests \n\n-  reduction in red blood cells which may turn your skin pale and make you breathless and weak \n\n-  local tissue damage at the injection site \n\n-  jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) – this has only been reported in infants \n\n-  problems with speech \n\n-  high or low blood pressure \n\n-  agitation \n\n-  lack of oxygen \n\n-  irregular heartbeat, including an abnormally slow or fast beating of the heart \n\n-  severe allergic reactions (so called anaphylactic reaction which may cause your throat or face to \n\nswell, difficulty breathing or a severe rash) \n\n-  an increase in methaemoglobin (an abnormal form of haemoglobin in the blood) \n\n-  shortness of breath  \n\n-  confusion \n\n-  shaking \n\n-  hives \n\n-  fever \n\n-  rapid breathing \n\n-  dilated pupils \n\n-  discoloured stools.
