Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSomaKit TOC 40 micrograms kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of powder contains 40 micrograms of edotreotide. \n \nThe radionuclide is not part of the kit. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nThe vial of buffer contains approximately 32.5 mg of sodium. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nKit for radiopharmaceutical preparation containing: \n- Powder for solution for injection: the vial contains a white lyophilised powder. \n- Reaction buffer: the vial contains a clear, colourless solution. \n \nFor radiolabelling with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nAfter radiolabelling with gallium (68Ga) chloride solution, the solution of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide \nobtained is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of somatostatin receptor \noverexpression in adult patients with confirmed or suspected well-differentiated gastro-\nenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) for localizing primary tumours and their \nmetastases. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe medicinal product should only be administered by trained healthcare professionals with technical \nexpertise in using and handling nuclear medicine diagnostic agents and only in a designated nuclear \nmedicine facility. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended activity for an adult weighing 70 kg is 100 to 200 MBq, administered by direct \nslow intravenous injection. \nThe activity will be adapted to patient characteristics, the type of PET camera used and acquisition \nmode. \n \nElderly population \nNo special dosage regimen for elderly patients is required. \n \n\n2 \n\n\n\nRenal impairment / Hepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide have not been studied in patients with renal or \nhepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has not been established in paediatric \npopulations, where the effective dose might be different than in adults. There is no recommendation \nfor use of SomaKit TOC in paediatric patients. \n \nMethod of administration  \nSomaKit TOC is for intravenous use and for single use only. \nThis medicinal product should be radiolabelled before administration to the patient. \n \nThe activity of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has to be measured with an activimeter immediately prior to \ninjection. \n \nThe injection of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide must be administered intravenously in order to avoid local \nextravasation resulting in inadvertent radiation to the patient and imaging artefacts. \n \nFor instructions on extemporaneous preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsections 6.6 and 12. \n \nFor patient preparation, see section 4.4. \n \nImage acquisition \nRadiolabelled SomaKit TOC is suitable for PET medical imaging. The acquisition must include a \nwhole body acquisition from skull to mid-thigh. The recommended time for imaging is 40 to \n90 minutes post injection. Imaging acquisition start time and duration should be adapted according to \nthe equipment used, the patient and the tumour characteristics in order to obtain the best image quality \npossible. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any of the \ncomponents of the labelled radiopharmaceutical. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPotential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions \nIf hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be \ndiscontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate \naction in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube \nmust be immediately available. \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification \nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity \nadministered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required diagnostic \ninformation. \n \nRenal / Hepatic impairment \nCareful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible. \n \nPaediatric population \nFor information on the use in paediatric population, see section 4.2. \nThe safety and efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide has not been established in paediatric \npopulations, where the effective dose might be different than in adults. \n\n3 \n\n\n\n \nPatient preparation \nThe patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void as often as \npossible, during the first hours after examination in order to reduce radiation. \n \nInterpretation of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide images and limitations of use \nPET images with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide reflect the presence of somatostatin receptors in the \ntissues. \n \nThe organs with high physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide include spleen, kidneys, liver, \npituitary gland, thyroid gland and adrenals. High physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide by \nthe pancreas uncinate process can also be observed. \n \nIn GEP-NET, a more intense gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake than normal background is a consistent \nfinding. However, lesions of GEP-NET not expressing sufficient density of somatostatin receptors \ncannot be visualised with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. PET images with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide \nshould be interpreted visually, and semiquantitative measurement of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake \nshould not be used for clinical interpretation of images. \n \nData supporting efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for predicting and monitoring of therapeutic \nresponse to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in histologically confirmed metastatic NET \nare limited (see section 5.1). \n \nIn case of Cushing syndrome, a long-term exposure to endogenous hypercortisolism may down \nregulate somatostatin receptor expression and negatively influence the results of somatostatin receptor \nimaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide. Thus, in patients with GEP-NET and Cushing syndrome, \nnormalisation of hypercortisolism should be suggested before performing PET with gallium (68Ga) \nedotreotide. \n \nAn increased uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is not specific for GEP-NET. Positive results \nrequire evaluating the possibility that another disease, characterised by high local somatostatin \nreceptor concentrations, may be present. As an example, an increase in somatostatin receptor density \ncan also occur in the following pathological conditions: subacute inflammations (areas of lymphocyte \nconcentrations), thyroid diseases (e.g. thyroid autonomy and Hashimoto\u2019s disease), tumours of the \npituitary gland, neoplasms of the lungs (small-cell carcinoma), meningiomas, mammary carcinomas, \nlympho-proliferative disease (e.g. Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphomas) and tumours \narising from tissue embryologically derived from the neural crest (e.g. paragangliomas, medullary \nthyroid carcinomas, neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas). \n \nSplenectomy should also be considered as a relevant factor when reporting the outcome of \nsomatostatin receptor targeted diagnostics. \n \nConcomitant use of somatostatin analogues \nIt is preferable to perform imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide the day(s) before the next \nadministration of a somatostatin analogue. See section 4.5. \n \nAfter the procedure \nClose contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the first 8 hours after \nadministration. \n \nSpecific warnings \nDepending on the time when you administer the injection, the content of sodium may in some cases be \ngreater than 1 mmol. This should be taken into account in patient on low sodium diet.  \n \nDue to the acidic pH of the radiolabelled gallium (68Ga) edotreotide solution, accidental extravasation \nmay cause local irritation. In case of extravasation, the injection must be stopped, the site of injection \nmust be changed and the affected area should be irrigated with sodium chloride solution. \n\n4 \n\n\n\n \nPrecautions with respect to environmental hazard are in section 6.6. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSomatostatin and its analogues are probably competing to bind to the same somatostatin receptors. \nTherefore, when treating patients with somatostatin analogues, it is preferable to perform imaging with \ngallium (68Ga) edotreotide the day(s) preceding the next administration of a somatostatin analogue.  \nA long-term exposure to endogenous hypercortisolism may down-regulate somatostatin receptor \nexpression and negatively influence the results of somatostatin receptor imaging with gallium (68Ga) \nedotreotide. In patients with Cushing syndrome, the normalisation of hypercortisolism should be \nconsidered before performing PET with SomaKit TOC. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \nwoman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using \nionizing radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. \n \nPregnancy \nNo data are available regarding the use of this product during pregnancy. Radionuclide procedures \ncarried out on pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the f\u0153tus. Only essential investigations \nshould therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit far exceeds the risk incurred \nby the mother and f\u0153tus. \n \nBreastfeeding \nBefore administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be \ngiven to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased \nbreastfeeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the \nsecretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding should \nbe interrupted for 8 hours and the expressed feeds discarded.  \n \nClose contact with infants should be restricted during the initial 8 hours following injection. \n \nFertility \nNo studies were conducted to assess the impact on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGallium (68Ga) edotreotide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. As the effective dose is about 4.5 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of \n200 MBq is administered, these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a low probability. \n \nAdverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA convention frequencies: Very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions  \nNot known: injection site pain \n\n5 \n\n\n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of administration of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be \nreduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by reinforced \nhydration and by frequent micturition. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that was \napplied. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for tumour detection, ATC code: \nV09IX09. \n \nMechanism of action \nGallium (68Ga) edotreotide binds to somatostatin receptors. In vitro, this radiopharmaceutical binds \nwith high affinity mainly to SSTR2 but also, to a lesser extent, to SSTR5. \nIn vivo, semiquantitative correlation was not assessed between gallium (68Ga) edotreotide uptake in \ntumours and the density of SSTR in histopathological samples neither in GEP-NET patients nor in \nnormal organs. Moreover, the in vivo binding of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide to structures or receptors \nother than SSTR remains unknown. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAt the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide does not \nappear to have any clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effect. \nEdotreotide is a somatostatin analogue. Somatostatin is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous \nsystem, but also a hormone which binds to cells of neuroendocrine origin and inhibits the release of \ngrowth hormone, insulin, glucagon, and gastrin. There is no data if the intravenous administration of \nedotreotide produces variation of serum gastrin and serum glucagon levels. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nFor the detection of the primary GEP-NET site in case of rising levels of a relevant biochemical \ntumour marker or in case of proven NET metastasis, patient-based sensitivity and specificity of \ngallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET were 100% (4/4) and 89% (8/9), respectively, in the prospective study \nof Gabriel et al. 2007. Lesion-detection rate was 75% (3/4) in the subgroup of patients with unknown \nprimary tumour site of the prospective study of Frilling et al. 2010. In the retrospective paper of \nSchreiter et al. 2014, the intra-individual comparison in a subgroup of 20 patients showed that gallium \n(68Ga) edotreotide permitted to localise the primary tumour in 9/20 (45%) patients while indium (111In) \npentetreotide did in 2/20 (10%). \n \nA prospective intra-individual comparison showed that gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is able to detect \nlesions better than indium (111In) pentetreotide. A lesion detection rate of 100% (40/40) versus 85% \n(34/40) was observed in the study of Hofmann et al. 2001 recruiting patients with histologically \nproven bronchial (n=2) or midgut (n=6) NETs. In the study of Buchmann et al. 2007, conducted in \n27 patients mostly with GEP-NET (59%) or NETs of unknown primary (30%), gallium (68Ga) \nedotreotide identified 279 lesions versus 157 lesions seen with indium (111In) pentetreotide. In the \nstudy of Van Binnebeek et al. 2015 in 53 patients with metastatic GEP-NET [mostly GEP-NET (n=39) \nor NET of unknown origin (n=6)], the lesion-based detection rate of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide was \n99.9% (1098/1099) versus 60% (660/1099) for indium (111In) pentetreotide based on the follow-up \n\n6 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nscans. In the study of Lee et al. 2015 in 13 GEP-NET patients, a total of 35 positive lesions were \ndetected in 10 patients on either gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET/CT or indium (111In) pentetreotide \nSPECT/CT while 3 patients did not exhibit any positive lesions on either imaging method. Gallium \n(68Ga) edotreotide detected 35/35 (100%) lesions vs 19/35=54% for indium (111In) pentetreotide \nSPECT/CT. In the study of Kowalski et al. 2003 in 4 patients with GEP-NET, gallium (68Ga) \nedotreotide showed better patient-based detection rate (100%) than indium (111In) pentetreotide (50%).  \n \nData available on clinical efficacy of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide for the indication of predicting and \nmonitoring of therapeutic response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in histologically \nconfirmed metastatic NET are limited. Five studies have been submitted, one of them prospective \n(Gabriel et al. 2009) and four retrospective studies (Kroiss et al. 2013, Ezziddin et al. 2012, \nKratochwil et al. 2015 and Luboldt et al.2010a). In the study by Gabriel et al. 2009 pre-PRRT gallium \n(68Ga) edotreotide was compared with CT or MRI using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \nTumors (RECIST). Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET and CT showed a concordant result in 32 patients \n(70%) and discrepancies in 14 patients (30%) presenting 9 with progressive disease and 5 with \nremission. \n \nThe retrospective study of Kroiss et al. 2013 in 249 NET patients showed that PRRT does not \nsignificantly influence semiquantitative uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide PET, except in liver \nmetastases of patients with NET, but the study lacked histological confirmation. The three remaining \nretrospective studies recruited small samples (ranging from 20 to 28 GEP-NET patients or those with \ncancer of unknown origin) and found that semiquantitative uptake in the pre-PRRT gallium (68Ga) \nedotreotide PET scan correlated with the tumour-absorbed doses per injected activity of the \nsubsequent first treatment cycle, differed between those lesions classified as responding and non-\nresponding after three PRRT cycles, and helped to separate hepatic metastases from normal liver \ntissue. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nAfter intravenous injection, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is rapidly cleared from the blood following bi-\nexponential elimination of activity with half-lives of 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 min and 48 \u00b1 7 min respectively. \n \nOrgan uptake \nThe organ with the highest physiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide is the spleen, followed \nby the kidneys. The uptake in the liver and in the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands is lower. High \nphysiological uptake of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide by the pancreas uncinate process can also be \nobserved. About 50 minutes after intravenous administration, gallium (68Ga) edotreotide accumulation \nshows plateauing in all organs. \nThe organ uptake has been shown to be age-independent in normal adult human tissues and also \npredominantly gender-independent (except for the thyroid and head of pancreas). \n \nElimination \nNo radioactive metabolites were detected in serum within 4 hours after intravenous injection of \ngallium (68Ga) edotreotide. \nApproximately 16% of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide activity is removed from the body in the urine \nwithin 2 to 4 hours. The peptide is excreted via kidneys as intact compound. \n \nHalf-life \nGiven that the elimination rate is substantially slower than the physical half-life of gallium (68Ga) \n(68 min), the biological half-life will have little impact on the effective half-life of the product which \nthen would be expected to be somewhat less than 68 minutes. \n \nRenal/Hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been characterized. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n7 \n\n\n\n \nNon-clinical data did not reveal any special hazard for gallium (68Ga) edotreotide in humans. \n \nLocal tolerance assessment resulted in mild to moderate inflammation signs in the perivascular region \nof some animals which can be attributed to the acidic pH of the solution. \n \nNo studies on fertility, embryology, mutagenicity or long-term carcinogenicity have been conducted. \n \nRegarding the novel excipient (1,10-phenanthroline), during the toxicity study conducted with the kit \nformulation of SomaKit TOC including 1,10-phenanthroline at a dose 400 fold higher than the human \ndose, no toxicity signs were observed.  \n \nGenotoxicity studies on 1,10-phenanthroline available in the literature show negative results in \nbacterial mutation assay (Ames test), while in a mouse lymphoma assay an indication of possible \ngenotoxicity was obtained at concentrations 750 times higher than the maximum 1,10-phenanthroline \nblood concentration achievable in patients. However, even taking as worst case reference the limits for \ngenotoxic and carcinogenic impurities, the risk related to the trace amounts of 1,10-phenanthroline in \nSomaKit TOC formulation is considered negligible at the dose to be administered in patients: the \nexposure to 1,10-phenanthroline (5 \u00b5g/dose) is 24 fold lower than the acceptable daily intake for a \ngenotoxic impurity (120 \u00b5g/day for exposures <1 month). \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPowder \n1,10-phenanthroline \nGentisic acid \nMannitol (E421) \n \nBuffer \nFormic acid \nSodium hydroxide (E524) \nWater for injections \n \nAfter radiolabelling, the solution obtained also contains, as excipient, hydrochloric acid from the \ngenerator eluate. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nRadiolabelling of carrier molecules with gallium (68Ga) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of \ntrace metal impurities. Only syringe and syringe needles able to minimise trace metal impurity levels \n(for example, non-metallic or coated with silicone needles \u2013 not supplied \u2013) should be used. \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other products except those mentioned in section 12. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nKit as packaged for sale \n12 months. \n \nAfter radiolabelling \n4 hours.  \nDo not store above 25\u00b0C after radiolabelling. \n\n8 \n\n\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions after radiolabelling of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \nStorage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive \nmaterials. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use \n \nEach pack contains: \n\n\u2022 One vial of powder for solution for injection: 10 ml Type I glass vial closed with a  \nbromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with a flip-off cap. Each vial contains \n40 micrograms of edotreotide. \n\n\u2022 One vial of buffer: 10 ml cyclic olefin polymer vial closed with a teflon stopper and sealed \nwith a flip-off cap. Each vial contains 1 ml of reaction buffer. \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nGeneral warnings \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorized persons in \ndesignated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer, and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organization.  \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n \nContents of the vials are intended only for use in the preparation of gallium (68Ga) edotreotide solution \nfor injection and are not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the \npreparative procedure.  \n \nEach 40 microgram vial contains an excess of product. However, it is recommended that the vial be \nprepared as instructed and used for a single patient dose, based on the activity to be injected; any \nremaining material should be discarded after radiolabelling and use. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administration of the medicinal product \nFor instructions on radiolabelling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.  \n \nIf at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of the vials is compromised it should not \nbe used. \n \nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimize risk of contamination of the \nmedicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. \n \nThe content of the kit before radiolabelling is not radioactive. However, after gallium (68Ga) chloride \nsolution is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained. \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spills of urine, vomiting, blood, etc. Radiation protection precautions in \naccordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n9 \n\n\n\n \n \n7.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nRadiation safety \u2013 Product handling \nUse waterproof gloves, effective radiation shielding, and appropriate safety measures when handling \nthe radiolabelled SomaKit TOC to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure to the patient, occupational \nworkers, clinical personnel, and other persons. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be used by or under the control of healthcare professionals who are \nqualified by specific training and experienced in the safe use and handling of radionuclides, and whose \nexperience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorised to \nlicense the use of radionuclides. \n \nThe gallium (68Ga) edotreotide solution must be prepared in accordance with radioprotection and \npharmaceutical quality standards, especially concerning aseptic technique. If at any time in the \npreparation of this product the integrity of the vials is compromised, the product should not be used. \n \nA low dead space 1 ml plastic syringe must be used in order to precisely measure the adequate volume \nof reaction buffer to be added during the preparation. Glass syringe must not be used. \n \nFor administration, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe fitted \nwith suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised automated \napplication system. \n \nMethod of preparation \nSomaKit TOC is supplied as a kit containing two vials. It is intended to be radiolabelled with a \ngallium (68Ga) chloride solution compliant with the Ph. Eur. monograph 2464 Gallium (68Ga) chloride \nsolution for radiolabelling and that, in addition, is sterile and has been tested for compatibility with \nSomaKit TOC. Only generators that have been authorised as medicinal products in the EU should be \nused. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the particular generator for more \ninformation. \n \nThe following authorised generators have shown to be compatible with SomaKit TOC: \n\n\u2022 GalliaPharm, 0.74 \u2013 1.85 GBq, radionuclide generator (Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH), \n\u2022 Galli Ad, 0.74 \u2013 1.85 GBq, radionuclide generator (IRE-Elit). \n\n \nThe gallium (68Ga) edotreotide solution for intravenous injection must be prepared according to \naseptic procedure, local regulation and the following instructions. \n \nReconstitution with GalliaPharm generator: \n\n11 \n\n\n\na. If possible, for more convenience in the preparation of radiolabelled SomaKit TOC, the \nheating platform should be placed right beside the generator. \n\nb.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n  \n\n27 \n\n\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nSomaKit TOC 40 micrograms kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation \nEdotreotide \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What SomaKit TOC is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before SomaKit TOC is used \n3. How SomaKit TOC is used \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How SomaKit TOC is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What SomaKit TOC is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. It contains the active \nsubstance edotreotide. Before it can be used, the powder in the vial is mixed with a radioactive \nsubstance called gallium (68Ga) chloride to make gallium (68Ga) edotreotide (this procedure is called \nradiolabelling).  \n \nGallium (68Ga) edotreotide contains a small amount of radioactivity. After injection into a vein, it can \nmake parts of the body areas visible to doctors during a medical imaging procedure called positron \nemission tomography (PET). This medical procedure obtains images of your organs, to help locate the \nabnormal cells or tumours giving valuable information about your disease. \n \nThe use of SomaKit TOC involves exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit from the procedure with the \nradiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before SomaKit TOC is used \n \nSomaKit TOC must not be used \n- if you are allergic to edotreotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your nuclear medicine specialist before you are given SomaKit TOC: \n- if you experience any signs of allergic reaction (listed in section 4) after previous administration \n\nof SomaKit TOC; \n- if you have kidney or liver problems (renal or hepatic disease); \n- if you are under 18 years of age; \n- if you have signs of dehydration before and after the examination; \n\n28 \n\n\n\n- if you have others medical conditions, such as high level of cortisol in the body (Cushing \nsyndrome), inflammation, thyroid disease, other type of tumour (of pituitary gland, lung, brain, \nbreast, immune system, thyroid, adrenal gland or others) or disease of spleen that may affect the \ninterpretation of the images; \n\n- if you have been taking other medicines, such as somatostatin analogues and glucocorticoids, \nwhich may interact with SomaKit TOC;  \n\n- if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant; \n- If you are breast-feeding. \n \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precaution before \nor after using SomaKit TOC. \n \nBefore administration of SomaKit TOC \nYou should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination in order to urinate as often as \npossible during the first hours after the procedure to ensure that SomaKit TOC is removed as quickly \nas possible from the body. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not recommended in patients under 18 years of age because its safety and efficacy \nhave not been established in this patient population. \n \nOther medicines and SomaKit TOC \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including somatostatin analogues, glucocorticoids (also called corticosteroids), since they \nmay interfere with the interpretation of the images. If you are taking somatostatin analogues you might \nbe asked to stop your treatment for a short period of time. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of SomaKit TOC if there is a \npossibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. \nWhen in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \nprocedure. \n \nThere is no information about the safety and the efficacy of the use of this medicine during pregnancy. \nOnly essential investigations should be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit far \nexceeds any risk to the mother and foetus. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding the nuclear medicine doctor may either delay the medical procedure until you \nno longer breast-feed or ask you to stop breastfeeding and to discard this milk until there is no \nradioactivity in your body (8 hours after the administration of SomaKit TOC).  \nPlease ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is considered unlikely that SomaKit TOC will affect your ability to drive or to use machines.  \n \nSomaKit TOC contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 1.5 mmol (or 32.5 mg) sodium per dose. Take this into consideration if you are \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How SomaKit TOC is used \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. SomaKit TOC \nwill only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by \n\n29 \n\n\n\npeople who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe \nuse of this product and will keep you informed of their actions. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of SomaKit TOC to \nbe used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.  \nThe quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 100 MBq to 200 MBq \n(megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity). \n \nAdministration of SomaKit TOC and conduct of the procedure  \nAfter radiolabelling, SomaKit TOC is administered by intravenous injection. \nA single injection is sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. \nAfter injection, you will be offered something to drink and asked to urinate immediately preceding the \ntest.  \n \nDuration of the procedure \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. \n \nAfter administration of SomaKit TOC, you should:  \n- avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 8 hours after the injection \n- urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from your body. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after \nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.  \n \nIf you have been given more SomaKit TOC than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose under controlled conditions by the \nnuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, you will \nreceive the appropriate treatment. Drinking and emptying your bladder frequently will help remove the \nradioactive substance from your body more quickly. \n \nShould you have any further questions on the use of SomaKit TOC, please ask the nuclear medicine \ndoctor who supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAlthough no side effects have been reported, a potential risk of allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \nexists with SomaKit TOC. Symptoms may include: warm flush, redness of the skin, swelling, itching, \nnausea and difficulty breathing. In case of allergic reactions you will receive the appropriate treatment \nfrom your medical staff. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\n- Stinging near the injection site \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk \nof cancer and hereditary abnormalities. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n\n30 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n5. How SomaKit TOC is stored \n \nYou will not have to store this medicine. This medicine is stored under the responsibility of the \nspecialist in appropriate premises. Storage of radiopharmaceuticals will be in accordance with national \nregulation on radioactive materials. \n \nThe following information is intended for the specialist only. \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nSomaKit TOC must not be used after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter radiolabelling, SomaKit TOC should be used within 4 hours. Do not store above 25\u00b0C after \nradiolabelling. \n \nSomaKit TOC must not be used if there are visible signs of deterioration. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

Of note the SmPC advises \nthat after radiolabelling, the solution obtained also contains, as excipient, hydrochloric acid from the \ngenerator eluate.  \nIn the current reporting interval, the number of cases has increased to 10. Of the 6 additional non-\nserious cases, 3 cases describe burning and tingling pain extending from the arm to the neck and \nlasting 20 seconds, which is considered highly probably related to edotreotide. The pH in all 3 cases \nwas 3.5. In a further case, the patient experienced stabbing pain extending from the hand to the \nshoulder during the injection and this was reported to be due to the low pH of the solution. Causality \nin these cases is probable. Of note, none of these cases appear to have a previous history of psychiatric \ndisorder as a confounding factor. Considering the data, an association with injection site pain is \nplausible given the acidic nature of the solution. It is therefore recommended that Injection site pain is \nlabelled in 4.8 of the SmPC of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation under SOC General \ndisorders and administration site conditions with frequency Not known, with a corresponding update \nto the PL.  \nOf note, edotreotide solution for injection contains no hydrochloric acid. The final pH is between 4 \nand 8. No cases of injection site pain have been identified with these medicines and no Product \nInformation changes are recommended. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for edotreotide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing edotreotide is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information for edotreotide kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n \n\n \n\n34 \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

administration of somakit toc; - if you have kidney or liver problems (renal or hepatic disease); - if you are under 18 years of age; - if you have signs of dehydration before and after the examination; 28 - if you have others medical conditions, such as high level of cortisol in the body (cushing syndrome), inflammation, thyroid disease, other type of tumour (of pituitary gland, lung, brain, breast, immune system, thyroid, adrenal gland or others) or disease of spleen that may affect the interpretation of the images; - if you have been taking other medicines, such as somatostatin analogues and glucocorticoids, which may interact with somakit toc; - if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant; - if you are breast-feeding. your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precaution before or after using somakit toc. before administration of somakit toc you should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination in order to urinate as often as possible during the first hours after the procedure to ensure that somakit toc is removed as quickly as possible from the body. children and adolescents this medicine is not recommended in patients under 18 years of age because its safety and efficacy have not been established in this patient population. other medicines and somakit toc tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including somatostatin analogues, glucocorticoids (also called corticosteroids), since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images. if you are taking somatostatin analogues you might be asked to stop your treatment for a short period of time. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. you must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of somakit toc if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. when in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. there is no information about the safety and the efficacy of the use of this medicine during pregnancy. only essential investigations should be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit far exceeds any risk to the mother and foetus. if you are breast-feeding the nuclear medicine doctor may either delay the medical procedure until you no longer breast-feed or ask you to stop breastfeeding and to discard this milk until there is no radioactivity in your body (8 hours after the administration of somakit toc). please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. driving and using machines it is considered unlikely that somakit toc will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. somakit toc contains sodium this medicine contains 1.5 mmol (or 32.5 mg) sodium per dose. take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "somakit toc",

safe use of this product and will keep you informed of their actions. the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of somakit toc to be used in your case. it will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. the quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 100 mbq to 200 mbq (megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity). administration of somakit toc and conduct of the procedure after radiolabelling, somakit toc is administered by intravenous injection. a single injection is sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. after injection, you will be offered something to drink and asked to urinate immediately preceding the test. duration of the procedure your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. after administration of somakit toc, you should: - avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 8 hours after the injection - urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from your body. the nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving this medicine. contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. if you have been given more somakit toc than you should an overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose under controlled conditions by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. however, in the case of an overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. drinking and emptying your bladder frequently will help remove the radioactive substance from your body more quickly. should you have any further questions on the use of somakit toc, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "somakit toc", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 11, "BeginOffset": 59, "EndOffset": 87, "Score":
