CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRepaglinide is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycaemia can no longer \nbe controlled satisfactorily by diet, weight reduction and exercise. Repaglinide is also indicated in \ncombination with metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not satisfactorily \ncontrolled on metformin alone.\n\nTreatment should be initiated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood glucose in relation \nto meals.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nRepaglinide is given preprandially and is titrated individually to optimise glycaemic control. In \naddition to the usual self-monitoring by the patient of blood and/or urinary glucose, the patient's blood \nglucose must be monitored periodically by the physician to determine the minimum effective dose for \nthe patient. Glycosylated haemoglobin levels are also of value in monitoring the patient's response to \ntherapy. Periodic monitoring is necessary to detect inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the \nrecommended maximum dose level (i.e. primary failure) and to detect loss of adequate blood-glucose-\nlowering response after an initial period of effectiveness (i.e. secondary failure).\n\n\n\n3\n\nShort-term administration of repaglinide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in \nType 2 diabetic patients usually controlled well on diet.\n\nInitial dose\n\nThe dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the patient's requirements.\nThe recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg. One to two weeks should elapse between titration steps (as \ndetermined by blood glucose response).\nIf patients are transferred from another oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product, the recommended \nstarting dose is 1 mg.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe recommended maximum single dose is 4 mg taken with main meals.\nThe total maximum daily dose should not exceed 16 mg.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo clinical studies have been conducted in patients >75 years of age.\n\nRenal impairment\nRepaglinide is not affected by renal disorders (see section 5.2). \nEight percent of one dose of repaglinide is excreted through the kidneys and total plasma clearance of \nthe product is decreased in patients with renal impairment. As insulin sensitivity is increased in \ndiabetic patients with renal impairment, caution is advised when titrating these patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency.\n\nDebilitated or malnourished patients\nIn debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and \ncareful dose titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions.\n\nPatients receiving other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products\nPatients can be transferred directly from other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products to repaglinide. \nHowever, no exact dosage relationship exists between repaglinide and the other oral hypoglycaemic \nmedicinal products. The recommended maximum starting dose of patients transferred to repaglinide is \n1 mg given before main meals.\n\nRepaglinide can be given in combination with metformin, when the blood glucose is insufficiently \ncontrolled with metformin alone. In this case, the dosage of metformin should be maintained and \nrepaglinide administered concomitantly. The starting dose of repaglinide is 0.5 mg, taken before main \nmeals; titration is according to blood glucose response as for monotherapy.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of repaglinide in children below 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nRepaglinide should be taken before main meals (i.e. preprandially).\n\nDoses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal but time may vary from immediately preceding \nthe meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal (i.e. preprandially 2, 3, or 4 meals a day). Patients \nwho skip a meal (or add an extra meal) should be instructed to skip (or add) a dose for that meal.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIn the case of concomitant use with other active substances refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5 to assess the \ndosage.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to repaglinide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Diabetes mellitus type 1, C-peptide negative.\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma.\n- Severe hepatic function disorder.\n- Concomitant use of gemfibrozil (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nRepaglinide should only be prescribed if poor blood glucose control and symptoms of diabetes persist \ndespite adequate attempts at dieting, exercise and weight reduction.\n\nWhen a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product is exposed to stress such as \nfever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be \nnecessary to discontinue repaglinide and treat with insulin on a temporary basis.\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nRepaglinide, like other insulin secretagogues, is capable of producing hypoglycaemia.\n\nCombination with insulin secretagogues\n\nThe blood glucose-lowering effect of oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products decreases in many \npatients over time. This may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished \nresponsiveness to the medicinal product. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to \ndistinguish it from primary failure, where the medicinal product is ineffective in an individual patient \nwhen first given. Adjustment of dose and adherence to diet and exercise should be assessed before \nclassifying a patient as a secondary failure.\n\nRepaglinide acts through a distinct binding site with a short action on the \u03b2-cells. Use of repaglinide in \ncase of secondary failure to insulin secretagogues has not been investigated in clinical trials.\nTrials investigating the combination with other insulin secretagogues have not been performed.\n\nCombination with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or thiazolidinediones\n\nTrials of combination therapy with NPH insulin or thiazolidinediones have been performed. However, \nthe benefit risk profile remains to be established when comparing to other combination therapies.\n\nCombination with metformin\n\nCombination treatment with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome\n\nThe use of repaglinide might be associated with an increased incidence of acute coronary syndrome \n(e.g. myocardial infarction), see sections 4.8 and 5.1.\n\nConcomitant use\n\nRepaglinide should be used with caution or be avoided in patients receiving medicinal products which \n\n\n\n5\n\ninfluence repaglinide metabolism (see section 4.5). If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring \nof blood glucose and close clinical monitoring should be performed.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nA number of medicinal products are known to influence repaglinide metabolism, possible interactions \nshould therefore be taken into account by the physician:\n\nIn vitro data indicate that repaglinide is metabolised predominantly by CYP2C8, but also by CYP3A4. \nClinical data in healthy volunteers support CYP2C8 as being the most important enzyme involved in \nrepaglinide metabolism with CYP3A4 playing a minor role, but the relative contribution of CYP3A4 \ncan be increased if CYP2C8 is inhibited. Consequently metabolism, and by that clearance of \nrepaglinide, may be altered by substances which influence these cytochrome P-450 enzymes via \ninhibition or induction. Special care should be taken when inhibitors of both CYP2C8 and 3A4 are co-\nadministered simultaneously with repaglinide.\n\nBased on in vitro data, repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake (organic anion \ntransporting protein OATP1B1). Substances that inhibit OATP1B1 may likewise have the potential to \nincrease plasma concentrations of repaglinide, as has been shown for ciclosporin (see below).\n\nThe following substances may enhance and/or prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: \nGemfibrozil, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, trimethoprim, ciclosporin, deferasirox, \nclopidogrel, other antidiabetic substances, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non selective beta \nblocking substances, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, salicylates, NSAIDs, \noctreotide, alcohol, and anabolic steroids.\n\nCo-administration of gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily), an inhibitor of CYP2C8, and repaglinide (a \nsingle dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC 8.1-fold and Cmax 2.4-fold in healthy \nvolunteers. Half-life was prolonged from 1.3 hr to 3.7 hr, resulting in possibly enhanced and \nprolonged blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide, and plasma repaglinide concentration at 7 hr \nwas increased 28.6-fold by gemfibrozil. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil and repaglinide is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nCo-administration of trimethoprim (160 mg twice daily), a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor, and \nrepaglinide (a single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC, Cmax and t\u00bd (1.6-fold, 1.4-fold \nand 1.2-fold respectively) with no statistically significant effects on the blood glucose levels. This lack \nof pharmacodynamic effect was observed with a sub-therapeutic dose of repaglinide. Since the safety \nprofile of this combination has not been established with dosages higher than 0.25 mg for repaglinide \nand 320 mg for trimethoprim, the concomitant use of trimethoprim with repaglinide should be \navoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed (see section 4.4).\n\nRifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, but also CYP2C8, acts both as an inducer and inhibitor of \nthe metabolism of repaglinide. Seven days pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg) followed by co-\nadministration of repaglinide (a single dose of 4 mg) at day seven resulted in a 50% lower AUC (effect \nof a combined induction and inhibition). When repaglinide was given 24 hours after the last rifampicin \ndose, an 80% reduction of the repaglinide AUC was observed (effect of induction alone). Concomitant \nuse of rifampicin and repaglinide might therefore induce a need for repaglinide dose adjustment which \nshould be based on carefully monitored blood glucose concentrations at both initiation of rifampicin \ntreatment (acute inhibition), following dosing (mixed inhibition and induction), withdrawal (induction \nalone) and up to approximately two weeks after withdrawal of rifampicin where the inductive effect of \nrifampicin is no longer present. It cannot be excluded that other inducers, e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John's wort, may have a similar effect.\n\nThe effect of ketoconazole, a prototype of potent and competitive inhibitors of CYP3A4, on the \npharmacokinetics of repaglinide has been studied in healthy subjects. Co-administration of 200 mg \nketoconazole increased the repaglinide (AUC and Cmax) by 1.2-fold with profiles of blood glucose \n\n\n\n6\n\nconcentrations altered by less than 8% when administered concomitantly (a single dose of 4 mg \nrepaglinide). Co-administration of 100 mg itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, has also been studied \nin healthy volunteers, and increased the AUC by 1.4-fold. No significant effect on the glucose level in \nhealthy volunteers was observed. In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of \n250 mg clarithromycin, a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, slightly increased the \nrepaglinide (AUC) by 1.4-fold and Cmax by 1.7-fold and increased the mean incremental AUC of \nserum insulin by 1.5-fold and the maximum concentration by 1.6-fold. The exact mechanism of this \ninteraction is not clear.\n\nIn a study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of repaglinide (a single \ndose of 0.25 mg) and ciclosporin (repeated dose at 100 mg) increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about \n2.5-fold and 1.8-fold respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher \nthan 0.25 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of ciclosporin with repaglinide should be avoided. If \nthe combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed \n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of deferasirox (30 mg/kg/day, \n4 days), a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and repaglinide (single dose, 0.5 mg) resulted \nin an increase in repaglinide systemic exposure (AUC) to 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) of control, a \n1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]) increase in Cmax, and a small, significant decrease in blood glucose \nvalues. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, \nthe concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided. If the combination appears \nnecessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4).\n\nIn an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of clopidogrel (300 mg loading \ndose), a CYP2C8 inhibitor, increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0\u2013\u221e) 5.1-fold and continued \nadministration (75 mg daily dose) increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0\u2013\u221e) 3.9-fold. A small, \nsignificant decrease in blood glucose values was observed.\n\n\u03b2-blocking medicinal products may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.\n\nCo-administration of cimetidine, nifedipine, oestrogen, or simvastatin with repaglinide, all CYP3A4 \nsubstrates, did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide.\n\nRepaglinide had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin, \ntheophylline or warfarin at steady state, when administered to healthy volunteers. Dosage adjustment \nof these compounds when co-administered with repaglinide is therefore not necessary.\n\nThe following substances may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide:\nOral contraceptives, rifampicin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, thiazides, corticosteroids, danazol, \nthyroid hormones and sympathomimetics.\n\nWhen these medications are administered to or withdrawn from a patient receiving repaglinide, the \npatient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control.\n\nWhen repaglinide is used together with other medicinal products that are mainly secreted by the bile, \nlike repaglinide, any potential interaction should be considered.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no studies of repaglinide in pregnant women. Repaglinide should be avoided during \n\n\n\n7\n\npregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere are no studies in breast-feeding women. Repaglinide should not be used in breast-feeding \nwomen.\n\nFertility\n\nData from animal studies investigating effects on embryofetal and offspring development as well as \nexcretion in milk is described in section 5.3.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nRepaglinide Krka has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines but may \ncause hypoglycaemia.\n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are changes in blood glucose levels, i.e. \nhypoglycaemia. The occurrence of such reactions depends on individual factors, such as dietary habits, \ndosage, exercise and stress.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nBased on the experience with repaglinide and with other hypoglycaemic medicinal products the \nfollowing adverse reactions have been seen: Frequencies are defined as:\n- Common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10)\n- Uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100)\n- Rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000)\n- Very rare (<1/10,000)\n- Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nImmune system disorders Allergic reactions* Very rare \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nHypoglycaemia Common\nHypoglycaemic coma and \nhypoglycaemic \nunconsciousness\n\nNot known\n\nEye disorders Refraction disorder* Very rare\nCardiac disorders Cardiovascular disease Rare\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, diarrhoea Common\n\nVomiting, constipation Very rare\nNausea Not known\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Abnormal hepatic function, \nincreased liver enzymes*\n\nVery rare\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity* Not known\n\n* see section Description of selected adverse reactions below\n\n\n\n8\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAllergic reactions\nGeneralised hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction), or immunological reactions such as \nvasculitis.\n\nRefraction disorders\nChanges in blood glucose levels have been known to result in transient visual disturbances, especially \nat the commencement of treatment. Such disturbances have only been reported in very few cases after \ninitiation of repaglinide treatment. No such cases have led to discontinuation of repaglinide treatment \nin clinical trials.\n\nAbnormal hepatic function, increased liver enzymes\nIsolated cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported during treatment with repaglinide. Most \ncases were mild and transient, and very few patients discontinued treatment due to increased liver \nenzymes. In very rare cases, severe hepatic dysfunction has been reported.\n\nHypersensitivity\nHypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as erythema, itching, rashes and urticaria. There is no \nreason to suspect cross-allergenicity with sulphonylurea due to the difference in chemical structure.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nRepaglinide has been given with weekly escalating doses from 4 \u2013 20 mg four times daily in a 6 week \nperiod. No safety concerns were raised. As hypoglycaemia in this study was avoided through \nincreased calorie intake, a relative overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose lowering effect with \ndevelopment of hypoglycaemic symptoms (dizziness, sweating, tremor, headache etc.).\n\nManagement\n\nShould these symptoms occur, adequate action should be taken to correct the low blood glucose (oral \ncarbohydrates). More severe hypoglycaemia with seizure, loss of consciousness or coma should be \ntreated with intravenous glucose.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, other blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. \ninsulins, ATC code: A10BX02\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRepaglinide is a short-acting oral secretagogue. Repaglinide lowers the blood glucose levels acutely \nby stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning \u03b2-cells in \nthe pancreatic islets.\nRepaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the \u03b2-cell membrane via a target protein \n\n\n\n9\n\ndifferent from other secretagogues. This depolarises the \u03b2-cell and leads to an opening of the calcium \nchannels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion from the \u03b2-cell.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurred within 30 minutes after an \noral dose of repaglinide. This resulted in a blood glucose-lowering effect throughout the meal period. \nThe elevated insulin levels did not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge. Plasma repaglinide \nlevels decreased rapidly, and low concentrations were seen in the plasma of Type 2 diabetic patients 4 \nhours post-administration.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nA dose-dependent decrease in blood glucose was demonstrated in Type 2 diabetic patients when \nadministered in doses from 0.5 to 4 mg repaglinide.\nClinical study results have shown that repaglinide is optimally dosed in relation to main meals \n(preprandial dosing).\nDoses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal, but the time may vary from immediately \npreceding the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal.\n\nOne epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome in repaglinide \ntreated patients as compared to sulfonylurea treated patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nRepaglinide is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to a rapid increase in the \nplasma concentration of the active substance. The peak plasma level occurs within one hour post \nadministration. After reaching a maximum, the plasma level decreases rapidly.\nRepaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by a mean absolute bioavailability of 63% (CV 11%).\n\nNo clinically relevant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, when repaglinide \nwas administered 0, 15 or 30 minutes before a meal or in fasting state.\n\nA high interindividual variability (60%) in repaglinide plasma concentrations has been detected in the \nclinical trials. Intraindividual variability is low to moderate (35%) and as repaglinide should be titrated \nagainst the clinical response, efficacy is not affected by interindividual variability.\n\nDistribution\n\nRepaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by low volume of distribution, 30 L (consistent with \ndistribution into intracellular fluid) and is highly bound to plasma proteins in humans (greater than \n98%).\n\nElimination\n\nRepaglinide is eliminated rapidly within 4 - 6 hours from the blood. The plasma elimination half-life is \napproximately one hour.\n\nRepaglinide is almost completely metabolised, and no metabolites with clinically relevant \nhypoglycaemic effect have been identified.\n\nRepaglinide metabolites are excreted primarily via the bile. A small fraction (less than 8%) of the \nadministered dose appears in the urine, primarily as metabolites. Less than 1% of repaglinide is \nrecovered in faeces.\n\n\n\n10\n\nSpecial patient groups\n\nRepaglinide exposure is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency and in the elderly type 2 \ndiabetic patients. The AUC (SD) after 2 mg single dose exposure (4 mg in patients with hepatic \ninsufficiency) was 31.4 ng/ml x hr (28.3) in healthy volunteers, 304.9 ng/ml x hr (228.0) in patients \nwith hepatic insufficiency, and 117.9 ng/ml x hr (83.8) in the elderly type 2 diabetic patients.\nAfter a 5 day treatment of repaglinide (2 mg x 3/day) in patients with a severe impaired renal function \n(creatinine clearance: 20-39 ml/min.), the results showed a significant 2-fold increase of the exposure \n(AUC) and half-life (t1/2) as compared to patients with normal renal function.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nNo data are available.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.\n\nRepaglinide was shown not to be teratogenic in animal studies. Embryotoxicity, abnormal limb \ndevelopment in rat foetuses and new born pups, was observed in female rats exposed to high doses in \nthe last stage of pregnancy and during the lactation period. Repaglinide was detected in the milk of \nanimals.\n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Repaglinide Krka is and what it is used for\n\nRepaglinide Krka is an oral antidiabetic medicine containing repaglinide which helps your pancreas \nproduce more insulin and thereby lower your blood sugar (glucose).\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease in which your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the sugar \nin your blood or where your body does not respond normally to the insulin it produces.\n\nRepaglinide Krka is used to control type 2 diabetes in adults as an add-on to diet and exercise: \ntreatment is usually started if diet, exercise and weight reduction alone have not been able to control \n(or lower) your blood sugar.\nRepaglinide Krka can also be given with metformin, another medicine for diabetes.\n\nRepaglinide Krka has been shown to lower the blood sugar, which helps to prevent complications \nfrom your diabetes.\n\n2.

of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you have type 1 diabetes. if the acid level in your blood is raised (diabetic ketoacidosis). if you have a severe liver disease. if you take gemfibrozil (a medicine used to lower increased fat levels in the blood). warning and precautions talk to your doctor before taking repaglinide krka: if you have liver problems. repaglinide krka is not recommended in patients with moderate liver disease. repaglinide krka should not be taken if you have a severe liver disease (see do 27 not take repaglinide krka). if you have kidney problems. repaglinide krka should be taken with caution. if you are about to have major surgery or you have recently suffered a severe illness or infection. at such times diabetic control may be lost. if you are under 18 or

you. your doctor will advise you. children and adolescents do not take this medicine if you are under 18 years of age. if you get a hypo (low blood sugar) you may get a hypo (short for hypoglycaemia) if your blood sugar gets too low. this may happen: if you take too much repaglinide krka if you exercise more than usual if you take other medicines or suffer from liver or kidney problems (see other sections of 2. what you need to know before you take repaglinide krka). the warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include: cold sweat, cool pale skin, headache, rapid heart beat, feeling sick, feeling very hungry, temporary changes in vision, drowsiness, unusual tiredness and weakness, nervousness or tremor, feeling anxious, feeling confused, difficulty in concentrating. if your blood sugar is low or you feel a hypo coming on eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack or drink, then rest. when symptoms of hypoglycaemia have disappeared or when blood sugar levels are stabilised continue repaglinide treatment. tell people you have diabetes and that if you pass out (become unconscious) due to a hypo, they must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. they must not give you any food or drink. it could choke you. if severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. if you have a hypo that makes you pass out, or a lot of hypos, talk to your doctor. the amount of repaglinide krka, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. if your blood sugar gets too high your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). this may happen: if you take too little repaglinide krka, if you have an infection or a fever, if you eat more than usual, if you exercise less than usual. the warning signs of too high blood sugar appear gradually. they include: increased urination, feeling thirsty, dry skin and dry mouth. talk to your doctor. the amount of repaglinide krka, food or exercise may need to be

medicine for diabetes, if your doctor prescribes it. if you take gemfibrozil (used to lower increased fat levels in the blood) you should not take repaglinide krka. your body's response to repaglinide krka may change if you take other medicines, especially these: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maoi) (used to treat depression). beta blockers (used to treat high blood pressure or heart conditions). ace-inhibitors (used to treat heart conditions). salicylates (e.g. aspirin). octreotide (used to treat cancer). nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) (a type of painkillers). steroids (anabolic
