CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVenclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously \nuntreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1). \n \nVenclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have \nreceived at least one prior therapy. \n \nVenclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL: \n\n in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have \nfailed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or \n\n in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both \nchemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with venetoclax should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nDose-titration schedule \n \nThe starting dose is 20 mg of venetoclax once daily for 7 days. The dose must be gradually increased over a \nperiod of 5 weeks up to the daily dose of 400 mg as shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Dose increase schedule \n \n\nWeek  Venetoclax daily dose \n1 20 mg  \n2 50 mg  \n3 100 mg \n4 200 mg  \n5 400 mg  \n\n \nThe 5-week dose-titration schedule is designed to gradually reduce tumour burden (debulk) and decrease the \nrisk of tumour lysis syndrome.  \n \nVenetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab \n \nVenetoclax is given for a total of 12 cycles, each cycle consisting of 28 days: 6 cycles in combination with \nobinutuzumab, followed by 6 cycles of venetoclax as a single agent. \n \nAdminister obinutuzumab 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg which may be administered on \nDay 1 or Day 2. Administer 1000 mg on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day \ncycle, for a total of 6 cycles. \n\n \nStart the 5-week venetoclax dose-titration schedule (see Table 1) on Cycle 1 Day 22 and continue through \nCycle 2 Day 28. \n \nAfter completing the dose-titration schedule, the recommended dose of venetoclax is 400 mg once daily \nfrom Cycle 3 Day 1 of obinutuzumab to the last day of Cycle 12. \n \nPost-titration dose for venetoclax in combination with rituximab \n \nThe recommended dose of venetoclax in combination with rituximab is 400 mg once daily (see section 5.1 \nfor details of the combination regimen). \n \nAdminister rituximab after the patient has completed the dose-titration schedule and has received the \nrecommended daily dose of 400 mg venetoclax for 7 days. \n \nVenetoclax is taken for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab (see section 5.1). \n \nPost-titration dose for venetoclax monotherapy \n \nThe recommended dose of venetoclax is 400 mg once daily. Treatment is continued until disease progression \nor no longer tolerated by the patient. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPrevention of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \nVenetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumour, and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week \ndose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur \nas early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of venetoclax and at each dose increase. \n \nThe risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including comorbidities. Patients with high tumour \nburden (e.g., any lymph node with a diameter ≥5 cm or high absolute lymphocyte count [ALC ≥25 x 109/l]) \nare at greater risk of TLS when initiating venetoclax. Reduced renal function (creatinine clearance \n[CrCl] <80 ml/min) further increases the risk. The risk may decrease as tumour burden decreases with \nvenetoclax treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nPrior to initiating venetoclax, tumour burden assessment, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), \nmust be performed for all patients. Blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and \ncreatinine) should be assessed and pre-existing abnormalities corrected. The prophylaxis measures listed \nbelow should be followed. More intensive measures should be employed as overall risk increases. \n \nHydration  \nPatients should be adequately hydrated during the dose-titration phase to reduce the risk of TLS. Patients \nshould be instructed to drink plenty of water daily starting 2 days before and throughout the dose-titration \nphase. Patients should be particularly instructed to drink 1.5 to 2.0 L of water daily, 2 days prior to and the \ndays of dosing at initiation and each subsequent dose increase. Intravenous fluids should be administered as \nindicated based on overall risk of TLS or for those who cannot maintain an adequate level of oral hydration. \n \nAnti-hyperuricaemic agents \nAnti-hyperuricaemic agents should be administered 2 to 3 days prior to starting treatment with venetoclax in \npatients with high uric acid levels or at risk of TLS and may be continued through the titration phase.  \n \nLaboratory assessments \nPre-dose: For all patients, blood chemistries should be assessed prior to the initial dose to evaluate kidney \nfunction and correct pre-existing abnormalities. Blood chemistries should be reassessed prior to each \nsubsequent dose increase during the titration phase. \n \nPost-dose: For patients at risk of TLS, blood chemistries should be monitored at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours \nafter the first dose of venetoclax. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected promptly. The next \nvenetoclax dose should not be administered until the 24-hour blood chemistry results have been evaluated. \nThe same monitoring schedule should be followed at the start of the 50 mg dose and then for patients who \ncontinue to be at risk, at subsequent dose increases.  \n \nHospitalisation  \nBased on physician assessment, some patients, especially those at greater risk of TLS, may require \nhospitalisation on the day of the first dose of venetoclax for more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring \nduring the first 24 hours (see section 4.8). Hospitalisation should be considered for subsequent dose increases \nbased on reassessment of risk.  \n \nDose modifications for tumour lysis syndrome \nIf a patient experiences blood chemistry changes suggestive of TLS, the following day’s venetoclax dose \nshould be withheld. If resolved within 24 to 48 hours of last dose, treatment with venetoclax can be resumed \nat the same dose. For events of clinical TLS or blood chemistry changes requiring more than 48 hours to \nresolve, treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose (see Table 2). When resuming treatment after \ninterruption due to TLS, the instructions for prevention of TLS should be followed (see “Prevention of \ntumour lysis syndrome” above).  \n \nDose modifications for other toxicities \nTreatment with Venclyxto should be withheld for any grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicities, grade 3 or \n4 neutropenia with infection or fever, or grade 4 haematological toxicities, except lymphopenia. Once the \ntoxicity has resolved to grade 1 or baseline level (recovery), therapy with venetoclax may be restarted at the \nsame dose. If the toxicity recurs, and for any subsequent occurrences, the dose reduction guidelines in \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 2 should be followed when resuming treatment with venetoclax following resolution. A larger dose \nreduction may occur at the discretion of the physician. For patients who require dose reductions to less than \n100 mg for more than 2 weeks, discontinuation of venetoclax should be considered.  \n \nTable 2: Dose modification for TLS and other toxicities \n \n\nDose at interruption \n(mg) \n\n \n\nRestart dose \n(mga) \n\n400 300 \n\n300 200 \n200 100 \n100 50 \n50 20 \n20 10 \n\naThe modified dose should be continued for 1 week before \nincreasing the dose. \n\n \nFor patients who have had a dosing interruption lasting more than 1 week during the first 5 weeks of dose \ntitration or more than 2 weeks after completing the dose-titration phase, TLS risk should be reassessed to \ndetermine if restarting at a reduced dose is necessary (e.g., all or some levels of the dose titration; see Table \n2). \n \nDose modifications for use with CYP3A inhibitors \nConcomitant use of venetoclax with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases venetoclax exposure and \nmay increase the risk for TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase and for other toxicities (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nTable 3 describes Venclyxto contraindication or dosage modification based on concomitant use with a strong \nor moderate CYP3A inhibitor. Patients should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicities and the dose \nmay need to be further adjusted. The venetoclax dose that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A inhibitor \nshould be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the inhibitor (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nTable 3: Management of potential Venclyxto interactions with CYP3A inhibitors \n\nInhibitors \nInitiation and titration \n\nphase a \nSteady daily dose \n\n(After titration phase) \nStrong CYP3A inhibitor Contraindicated Reduce the Venclyxto dose by at least 75% \n\nModerate CYP3A inhibitor Reduce the Venclyxto dose by at least 50% \naAvoid concomitant use of Venclyxto with moderate CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose \ntitration phase. Consider alternative medications or reduce the Venclyxto dose as described in this table. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a dose of venetoclax within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take \nthe missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. If a patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the \npatient should not take the missed dose and should resume the usual dosing schedule the following day. \n \nIf a patient vomits following dosing, no additional dose should be taken that day. The next prescribed dose \nshould be taken at the usual time the following day. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nNo specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥65 years) (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 ml/min and \n<90 ml/min) (see section 5.2). Patients with reduced renal function (CrCl <80 ml/min) may require more \nintensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration \nphase (see “Prevention of tumour lysis syndrome” above). Safety in patients with severe renal impairment \n(CrCl <30 ml/min) or on dialysis has not been established, and a recommended dose for these patients has \nnot been determined. Venetoclax should be administered to patients with severe renal impairment only if the \nbenefit outweighs the risk and patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity due to increased risk \nof TLS (see section 4.4).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicity at initiation and during \nthe dose-titration phase (see section 4.8).  \n \nA dose reduction of at least 50% throughout treatment is recommended for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). These patients should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicity (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of venetoclax in children aged less than 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nVenclyxto film-coated tablets are for oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole with \nwater at approximately the same time each day. The tablets should be taken with a meal in order to avoid a \nrisk for lack of efficacy (see section 5.2). The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or broken before \nswallowing. \n \nDuring the dose-titration phase, venetoclax should be taken in the morning to facilitate laboratory \nmonitoring. \n \nGrapefruit products, Seville oranges, and starfruit (carambola) should be avoided during treatment with \nvenetoclax (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase (see sections \n4.2 and 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of preparations containing St. John’s wort (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome, including fatal events, has occurred in patients with CLL with high tumour burden \nwhen treated with venetoclax (see section 4.8). \n \nVenetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumour, and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week \ndose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur \nas early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of venetoclax and at each dose increase. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nThe risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including comorbidities. Patients with high tumour \nburden (e.g., any lymph node with a diameter ≥5 cm or high ALC ≥25 x 109/l) are at greater risk of TLS \nwhen initiating venetoclax. Reduced renal function (CrCl <80 ml/min) further increases the risk. Patients \nshould be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and \nanti-hyperuricaemics. Blood chemistries should be monitored and abnormalities managed promptly. Dosing \nshould be interrupted if needed (see section 4.2). More intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent \nmonitoring, hospitalisation) should be employed as overall risk increases. The instructions for “Prevention of \ntumour lysis syndrome” should be followed (see section 4.2).  \n \nConcomitant use of this medicinal product with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases venetoclax \nexposure and may increase the risk for TLS at initiation and during the dose-titration phase (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.3). Also, inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase venetoclax exposure (see section 4.5). \n \nNeutropenia and infections \n \nGrade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been reported in patients treated with venetoclax in combination studies with \nrituximab or obinutuzumab and in monotherapy studies (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be \nmonitored throughout the treatment period. Dose interruptions or reductions are recommended for patients \nwith severe neutropenia (see section 4.2). \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). Monitoring of \nany signs and symptoms of infection is required. Suspected infections are to receive prompt treatment, \nincluding antimicrobials and dose interruption or reduction as appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \nImmunisation \n \nThe safety and efficacy of immunisation with live attenuated vaccines during or following venetoclax \ntherapy have not been studied. Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment and thereafter until \nB-cell recovery. \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nCo-administration of CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased venetoclax exposure and consequently a risk \nfor lack of efficacy. Concomitant use of venetoclax with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking \nvenetoclax (see section 4.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nVenetoclax is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A.  \n \nAgents that may alter venetoclax plasma concentrations \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \nCo-administration of 400 mg once daily ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, for 7 days \nin 11 previously treated patients with NHL increased venetoclax Cmax by 2.3-fold and AUC∞ by 6.4-fold. Co-\nadministration of 50 mg once daily ritonavir, a strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor, for 14 days in 6 healthy \nsubjects increased venetoclax Cmax by 2.4-fold and AUC by 7.9-fold. Co-administration of venetoclax with \nother strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase venetoclax AUC by on average 5.8- to 7.8-fold.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nConcomitant use of venetoclax with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, \nposaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) at initiation and during the dose-titration phase is \ncontraindicated due to increased risk for TLS (see section 4.3). \n \nAt initiation and during the dose-titration phase, concomitant use of venetoclax with moderate CYP3A \ninhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil) should be avoided. \nAlternative treatments should be considered. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, the initiation dose \nof venetoclax and the doses for the titration phase (see section 4.2) should be reduced by at least 50%. \nPatients should be monitored more closely for signs and symptoms of TLS.  \n \nFor patients who have completed the dose-titration phase and are on a steady daily dose of venetoclax, the \nvenetoclax dose should be reduced by 50% when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and \nby 75% when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Patients should be monitored more closely \nfor signs of toxicities and the dose may need to be further adjusted. The venetoclax dose that was used prior \nto initiating the CYP3A inhibitor should be resumed 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the inhibitor (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nGrapefruit products, Seville oranges, and starfruit (carambola) should be avoided during treatment with \nvenetoclax as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A. \n \nP-gp and BCRP inhibitors \nVenetoclax is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Co-administration of a 600 mg single dose of rifampin, a P-gp \ninhibitor, in 11 healthy subjects increased venetoclax Cmax by 106% and AUC∞ by 78%. Concomitant use of \nvenetoclax with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase should be \navoided; if a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor must be used, patients should be monitored closely for signs of \ntoxicities (see section 4.4).  \n \nCYP3A inducers \nCo-administration of 600 mg once daily rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, for 13 days in 10 healthy \nsubjects decreased venetoclax Cmax by 42% and AUC∞ by 71%. Concomitant use of venetoclax with strong \nCYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, \nefavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided. Alternative treatments with less CYP3A \ninduction should be considered. Preparations containing St. John's wort are contraindicated during treatment \nwith venetoclax, as efficacy may be reduced (see section 4.3). \n \nAzithromycin \nIn a drug-drug interaction study in 12 healthy subjects, co-administration of 500 mg of azithromycin on the \nfirst day followed by 250 mg of azithromycin once daily for 4 days decreased venetoclax Cmax by 25% and \nAUC∞ by 35%. No dose adjustment is needed during short-term use of azithromycin when administered \nconcomitantly with venetoclax. \n \nGastric acid reducing agents \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, gastric acid reducing agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, \nH2-receptor antagonists, antacids) do not affect venetoclax bioavailability. \n \nBile acid sequestrants \nCo-administration of bile acid sequestrants with venetoclax is not recommended as this may reduce the \nabsorption of venetoclax. If a bile acid sequestrant is to be co-administered with venetoclax, the SmPC for \nthe bile acid sequestrant should be followed to reduce the risk for an interaction, and venetoclax should be \nadministered at least 4-6 hours after the sequestrant. \n \nAgents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by venetoclax \n \nWarfarin \nIn a drug-drug interaction study in three healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of 400 mg \nvenetoclax with 5 mg warfarin resulted in an 18% to 28% increase in Cmax and AUC∞ of R-warfarin and \n\n\n\n9 \n\nS-warfarin. Because venetoclax was not dosed to steady state, it is recommended that the international \nnormalized ratio (INR) be monitored closely in patients receiving warfarin. \n \nSubstrates of P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1 \nVenetoclax is a P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro. In a drug-drug interaction study, \nadministration of a single 100 mg dose of venetoclax with 0.5 mg digoxin, a P-gp substrate, resulted in a \n35% increase in digoxin Cmax and a 9% increase in digoxin AUC∞. Co-administration of narrow therapeutic \nindex P-gp, or BCRP substrates (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, everolimus, sirolimus) with venetoclax should be \navoided.  \n \nIf a narrow therapeutic index P-gp or BCRP substrate must be used, it should be used with caution. For an \norally administered P-gp or BCRP substrate sensitive to inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., \ndabigatran exetilate), its administration should be separated from venetoclax administration as much as \npossible to minimise a potential interaction.  \n \nIf a statin (OATP substrate) is used concomitantly with venetoclax, close monitoring of statin-related toxicity \nis recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females  \n \nWomen should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Venclyxto and for at least 30 days after ending \ntreatment. Therefore, women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive measures \nwhile taking venetoclax and for 30 days after stopping treatment. It is currently unknown whether venetoclax \nmay reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal \ncontraceptives should add a barrier method.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nBased on embryo-foetal toxicity studies in animals (see section 5.3), venetoclax may harm the foetus when \nadministered to pregnant women.  \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled data from the use of venetoclax in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Venetoclax is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using highly effective contraception.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether venetoclax or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nA risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. \n \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Venclyxto.   \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of venetoclax on fertility are available. Based on testicular toxicity in dogs at \nclinically relevant exposures, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with venetoclax (see section \n5.3). Before starting treatment, counselling on sperm storage may be considered in some male patients. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVenclyxto has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported \nin some patients taking venetoclax and should be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or \noperate machines. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of Venclyxto is based on data from 758 patients with CLL treated in clinical trials \nwith venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab or as monotherapy. The safety analysis \nincluded patients from two phase 3 studies (CLL14 and MURANO), two phase 2 studies (M13-982 and \nM14-032), and one phase 1 study (M12-175). CLL14 was a randomised, controlled trial in which 212 \npatients with previously untreated CLL and comorbidities received venetoclax in combination with \nobinutuzumab. MURANO was a randomised, controlled trial in which 194 patients with previously treated \nCLL received venetoclax in combination with rituximab. In the phase 2 and phase 1 studies, 352 patients \nwith previously treated CLL, which included 212 patients with 17p deletion and 146 patients who had failed \na B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor were treated with venetoclax monotherapy (see section 5.1). \n \nThe most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in the \ncombination studies with obinutuzumab or rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract \ninfection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were neutropenia/neutrophil count \ndecreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. \n \nThe most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (≥2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in \ncombination with obinutuzumab or rituximab were pneumonia, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, and TLS. In the \nmonotherapy studies, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were pneumonia and \nfebrile neutropenia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions reported with Venclyxto, either in combination with obinutuzumab or \nrituximab or as monotherapy, are summarised in Table 4. Adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA \nbody system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 4: Adverse drug reactions reported in patients with CLL treated with venetoclax \n\nSystem organ class \nFrequency (all \n\ngrades)a \nAdverse reactions \n\n \nGrade ≥3a \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nVery common \nPneumonia \nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection \n\n \n\nCommon \nSepsis \nUrinary tract infection \n \n\nSepsis \nPneumonia  \nUrinary tract infection  \nUpper respiratory tract infection\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nVery common Neutropenia Anaemia  \nLymphopenia\n\nNeutropenia  \nAnaemia \n\nCommon Febrile neutropenia  \n\n \nFebrile neutropenia \nLymphopenia \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n \n\nVery common \nHyperkalaemia \nHyperphosphataemia \nHypocalcaemia\n\n \n\nCommon \nTumour lysis syndrome \nHyperuricaemia \n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \nHyperkalaemia \nHyperphosphataemia \nHypocalcaemia \nHyperuricaemia \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nVery common \n\nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea \nConstipation\n\n \n\nCommon  \nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea \n\nUncommon  \nConstipation \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n \n\nVery common Fatigue \n \n\nCommon  \nFatigue \n\nInvestigations \n \n\nCommon Blood creatinine increased\n \n\nUncommon  Blood creatinine increased \naOnly the highest frequency observed in the trials is reported (based on studies CLL14, MURANO, M13-\n982, M14-032, and M12-175). \n\n \nDiscontinuation and dose reductions due to adverse reactions \nDiscontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients treated with venetoclax in \ncombination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in the CLL14 and MURANO studies, respectively.  In the \nmonotherapy studies with venetoclax, 11% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. \n \nDosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with the combination of \nvenetoclax and obinutuzumab in the CLL14 study, in 15% of patients treated with the combination of \n\n\n\n12 \n\nvenetoclax and rituximab in the MURANO study and 14% of patients treated with venetoclax in the \nmonotherapy studies. \n \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 74% of patients treated with the combination of \nvenetoclax and obinutuzumab in the CLL14 study and in 71% of patients treated with the combination of \nvenetoclax and rituximab in the MURANO study; the most common adverse reaction that led to dose \ninterruption of venetoclax was neutropenia (41% and 43% in the CLL14 and MURANO studies, \nrespectively). In the monotherapy studies with venetoclax, dose interruptions due to adverse reactions \noccurred in 40% of patients; the most common adverse reaction leading to dose interruption was neutropenia \n(5%). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nTumour lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating venetoclax. In the initial Phase 1 \ndose-finding studies, which had a shorter (2 to 3 week) titration phase and higher starting dose, the incidence \nof TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS; 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute \nrenal failure, 1 requiring dialysis.  \n \nThe risk of TLS was reduced after revision of the dosing regimen and modification to prophylaxis and \nmonitoring measures. In venetoclax clinical studies, patients with any measurable lymph node ≥10 cm or \nthose with both an ALC ≥25 x 109/l and any measurable lymph node ≥5 cm were hospitalised to enable more \nintensive hydration and monitoring for the first day of dosing at 20 mg and 50 mg during the titration phase \n(see section 4.2).  \n \nIn 168 patients with CLL starting with a daily dose of 20 mg and increasing over 5 weeks to a daily dose of \n400 mg in studies M13-982 and M14-032, the rate of TLS was 2%. All events were laboratory TLS \n(laboratory abnormalities that met ≥2 of the following criteria within 24 hours of each other: \npotassium >6 mmol/l, uric acid >476 µmol/l, calcium <1.75 mmol/l, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/l; or were \nreported as TLS events) and occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) ≥5 cm or ALC ≥25 x 109/l. No \nTLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death and/or \nseizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CrCl ≥50 ml/min. \n \nIn the open-label, randomised phase 3 study (MURANO), the incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients \ntreated with venetoclax + rituximab. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the study, the protocol was \namended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in Posology (see \nsection 4.2). All events of TLS occurred during the venetoclax dose-titration phase and resolved within two \ndays. All six patients completed the dose titration and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of \nvenetoclax. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week dose-titration \nschedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures (see section 4.2). The rates of grade ≥3 laboratory \nabnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalaemia 1%, hyperphosphataemia 1%, and hyperuricaemia 1%. \n \nIn the open-label, randomised phase 3 study (CLL14), the incidence of TLS was 1.4% (3/212) in patients \ntreated with venetoclax + obinutuzumab. All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal \nfrom the study. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events. \n \n\n Neutropenia and infections \n Neutropenia is an identified risk with Venclyxto treatment. In the CLL14 study, neutropenia (all grades) was \n\nreported in 58% of patients in the venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm; 41% of patients treated with \nvenetoclax + obinutuzumab experienced dose interruption and 2% of patients discontinued venetoclax due to \nneutropenia. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 25% of patients and grade 4 neutropenia in 28% of \npatients. The median duration of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 22 days (range: 2 to 363 days). Febrile \nneutropenia was reported in 6% of patients, grade ≥3 infections in 19%, and serious infections in 19% of \npatients. Deaths due to infection occurred in 1.9% of patients while on treatment and 1.9% of patients \nfollowing treatment discontinuation. \n\n In the MURANO study, neutropenia (all grades) was reported in 61% of patients in the \nvenetoclax + rituximab arm. Forty-three percent of patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab experienced \n\n\n\n13 \n\ndose interruption and 3% of patients discontinued venetoclax due to neutropenia. Grade 3 neutropenia was \nreported in 32% of patients and grade 4 neutropenia in 26% of patients. The median duration of grade 3 or 4 \nneutropenia was 8 days (range: 1 to 712 days). With venetoclax + rituximab treatment, febrile neutropenia \nwas reported in 4% of patients, grade ≥3 infections in 18%, and serious infections in 21% of patients.  \n\n  \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for venetoclax. Patients who experience overdose should be closely monitored \nand appropriate supportive treatment provided. During dose-titration phase, treatment should be interrupted \nand patients should be monitored carefully for signs and symptoms of TLS (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, \nconfusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, muscle \nor joint pain, abdominal pain and distension) along with other toxicities (see section 4.2). Based on \nvenetoclax large volume of distribution and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in \nsignificant removal of venetoclax. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX52 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nVenetoclax is a potent, selective inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. \nOverexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL cells where it mediates tumour cell survival and \nhas been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax binds directly to the BH3-binding \ngroove of BCL-2, displacing BH3 motif-containing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, to initiate mitochondrial \nouter membrane permeabilization (MOMP), caspase activation, and programmed cell death. In non-clinical \nstudies, venetoclax has demonstrated cytotoxic activity in tumour cells that overexpress BCL-2. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nThe effect of multiple doses of venetoclax up to 1200 mg once daily on the QTc interval was evaluated in an \nopen-label, single-arm study in 176 patients. Venetoclax had no effect on QTc interval and there was no \nrelationship between venetoclax exposure and change in QTc interval. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nVenetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL – \nstudy BO25323 (CLL14) \nA randomised (1:1), multicenter, open-label phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nvenetoclax + obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab + chlorambucil in patients with previously untreated CLL \nand comorbidities (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score >6 or creatinine clearance [CrCl] \n<70 ml/min). Patients in the study were assessed for risk of TLS and received prophylaxis accordingly prior \nto obinutuzumab administration. All patients received obinutuzumab at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed \nby 900 mg which could have been administered on Day 1 or Day 2, then 1000 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of \nCycle 1, and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. On Day 22 of Cycle 1, patients in the \nvenetoclax + obinutuzumab arm began the 5-week venetoclax dose-titration schedule, continuing through \nCycle 2 Day 28. Upon completion of the dose-titration schedule, patients continued venetoclax 400 mg once \n\n\n\n14 \n\ndaily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. Each cycle was 28 days. Patients randomised to the \nobinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm received 0.5 mg/kg oral chlorambucil on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycles \n1-12. Patients continued to be followed for disease progression and overall survival after completing therapy. \n \nBaseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the study arms. The median age was \n72 years (range: 41 to 89 years), 89% were white, and 67% were male; 36% and 43% were Binet stage B and \nC, respectively. The median CIRS score was 8.0 (range: 0 to 28) and 58% of patients had CrCl <70 ml/min. \nA 17p deletion was detected in 8% of patients, TP53 mutations in 10%, 11q deletion in 19%, and unmutated \nIgVH in 57%. The median follow-up at the time of the primary analysis was 28 months (range: 0 to \n36 months). \n \nAt baseline, the median lymphocyte count was 55 x 109 cells/l in both study arms. On Cycle 1 Day 15, the \nmedian count had decreased to 1.03 x 109 cells/l (range: 0.2 to 43.4 x 109 cells/l) in the \nobinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm and 1.27 x 109 cells/l (range: 0.2 to 83.7 x 109 cells/l) in the \nvenetoclax + obinutuzumab arm. \n \nProgression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by investigators and by an Independent Review Committee \n(IRC) using the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National \nCancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines (2008). \n \nEfficacy results for investigator-assessed PFS at the time of the primary analysis (data cut-off date 17 August \n2018) are shown in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Investigator-assessed progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated CLL in CLL14 \n(primary analysis) \n \n\n Venetoclax + \nobinutuzumab \n\n(N = 216 )\n\nObinutuzumab + chlorambucil\n(N = 216) \n\nNumber of events (%)   30 (14) 77 (36) \n    Median, months (95% CI)  NR NR \n    Hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.35 (0.23, 0.53) \n    P-valuea <0.0001\n    12-month PFS estimate (95% CI) 94.6 (91.5, 97.7) 92.2 (88.4, 95.8) \n    24-month PFS estimate (95% CI) 88.2 (83.7, 95.1) 64.1 (57.4, 70.8)\nCI = confidence interval; NR = not reached \naStratified P-value. \n\n \nAt an updated efficacy analysis (data cut-off date 23 August 2019 and median follow-up of 40 months), the \nmedian PFS had not been reached in the venetoclax + obinutuzumab arm and was 35.6 months [95% CI: \n33.7,40.7] in the obinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm with a HR of 0.31 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.44].

Venetoclax steady state AUC increased proportionally over the dose range of \n150-800 mg. Under low-fat meal conditions, venetoclax mean (± standard deviation) steady state Cmax was \n2.1 ± 1.1 μg/ml and AUC24 was 32.8 ± 16.9  μg•h/ml at the 400 mg once daily dose. \n \nEffect of food \n \nAdministration with a low-fat meal increased venetoclax exposure by approximately 3.4-fold and \nadministration with a high-fat meal increased venetoclax exposure by 5.1- to 5.3-fold compared to fasting \nconditions. It is recommended that venetoclax should be administered with a meal (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \n \nVenetoclax is highly bound to human plasma protein with unbound fraction in plasma <0.01 across a \nconcentration range of 1-30 µM (0.87-26 µg/ml). The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.57. The population \nestimate for apparent volume of distribution (Vdss/F) of venetoclax ranged from 256-321 L in patients. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated that venetoclax is predominantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. \nM27 was identified as a major metabolite in plasma with an inhibitory activity against BCL-2 that is at least \n58-fold lower than venetoclax in vitro.   \n \nIn vitro interaction studies \n \nCo administration with CYP and UGT substrates \nIn vitro studies indicated that venetoclax is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Venetoclax is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9 and UGT1A1 in vitro, but it is not predicted to cause clinically relevant inhibition. Venetoclax is \nnot an inhibitor of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. \n \nCo administration with transporter substrates/inhibitors \nVenetoclax is a P-gp and BCRP substrate as well as a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor and a weak OATP1B1 \ninhibitor in vitro (see section 4.5). Venetoclax is not expected to inhibit OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, \nOAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nElimination \n \nThe population estimate for the terminal phase elimination half-life of venetoclax was approximately \n26 hours. Venetoclax shows minimal accumulation with accumulation ratio of 1.30-1.44. After a single oral \nadministration of 200 mg radiolabeled [14C]-venetoclax to healthy subjects, >99.9% of the dose was \nrecovered in faeces and <0.1% of the dose was excreted in urine within 9 days. Unchanged venetoclax \naccounted for 20.8% of the administered radioactive dose excreted in faeces. The pharmacokinetics of \nvenetoclax do not change over time. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 219 subjects with mild renal impairment \n(CrCl ≥60 and <90 ml/min), 86 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 and <60 ml/min) and \n217 subjects with normal renal function (CrCl ≥90 ml/min), venetoclax exposures in subjects with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment are similar to those with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of \nvenetoclax has not been studied in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or patients on \ndialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 74 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, \n7 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 442 subjects with normal hepatic function, venetoclax \nexposures are similar in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. \nMild hepatic impairment was defined as normal total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (AST) > upper \nlimit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 times ULN, moderate hepatic impairment as total \nbilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 times ULN, and severe hepatic impairment as total bilirubin >3.0 ULN.  \n \nIn a dedicated hepatic impairment study, venetoclax Cmax and AUC in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A; \nn=6) or moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=6) hepatic impairment were similar to subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction, after receiving a 50 mg single dose of venetoclax. In subjects with severe (Child-Pugh C; n=5) \nhepatic impairment, the mean venetoclax Cmax was similar to subjects with normal hepatic function but \nvenetoclax AUCinf was on average 2.7-fold higher (range: no change to 5-fold higher) than venetoclax \nAUCinf in the subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). \n \nEffects of age, sex, and weight \n \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, sex, and weight do not have an effect on venetoclax \nclearance. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicities observed in animal studies with venetoclax included dose-dependent reductions in lymphocytes \nand red blood cell mass. Both effects were reversible after cessation of dosing with venetoclax, with \nrecovery of lymphocytes occurring 18 weeks post treatment. Both B- and T-cells were affected, but the most \nsignificant decreases occurred with B-cells.  \n \nVenetoclax also caused single cell necrosis in various tissues, including the gallbladder and exocrine \npancreas, with no evidence of disruption of tissue integrity or organ dysfunction; these findings were \nminimal to mild in magnitude.  \n \nAfter approximately 3 months of daily dosing in dogs, venetoclax caused progressive white discoloration of \nthe hair coat, due to loss of melanin pigment in the hair. \n \nCarcinogenicity/genotoxicity \n \nVenetoclax and the M27 major human metabolite were not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic (Tg.rasH2) \nmouse carcinogenicity study at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of venetoclax and at a single dose level of \n250 mg/kg/day of M27. Exposure margins (AUC), relative to the clinical AUC at 400 mg/day, were \napproximately 2-fold for venetoclax and 5.8-fold for M27. \n \nVenetoclax was not genotoxic in bacterial mutagenicity assay, in vitro chromosome aberration assay and in \nvivo mouse micronucleus assay. The M27 metabolite was negative for genotoxicity in the bacterial \nmutagenicity and chromosomal aberration assays. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nReproductive toxicity \n \nNo effects on fertility were observed in fertility and early embryonic development studies in male and female \nmice. Testicular toxicity (germ cell loss) was observed in general toxicity studies in dogs at exposures of 0.5 \nto 18 times the human AUC exposure at a dose of 400 mg. Reversibility of this finding has not been \ndemonstrated. \n \nIn embryo-foetal development studies in mice, venetoclax was associated with increased post-implantation \nloss and decreased foetal body weight at exposures of 1.1 times the human AUC exposure at a dose of \n400 mg. The major human metabolite M27 was associated with post-implantation loss and resorptions at \nexposures approximately 9-times the human M27-AUC exposure at a 400 mg dose of venetoclax. In rabbits, \nvenetoclax produced maternal toxicity, but no foetal toxicity at exposures of 0.1 times the human AUC \nexposure at a 400 mg dose. \n \n \n6.

What Venclyxto is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Venclyxto is \nVenclyxto is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance venetoclax. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called “BCL-2 inhibitors”. \n \nWhat Venclyxto is used for \nVenclyxto is used to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). \n \nVenclyxto may be given to you in combination with other medicines or alone. \n \nCLL is a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called lymphocytes and the lymph nodes. In CLL, the \nlymphocytes multiply too quickly and live for too long, so that there are too many of them in the blood. \n \nHow Venclyxto works \nVenclyxto works by blocking a protein in the body called “BCL-2”. This protein helps cancer cells survive. \nBlocking this protein helps to kill and lower the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of \nthe disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Venclyxto \n \nDo not take Venclyxto if: \n- you are allergic to the active substance venetoclax or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).  \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n- you are taking any of the medicines listed below when you start your treatment and while your dose is \ngradually being increased (usually over 5 weeks). This is because serious and life-threatening effects can \noccur when Venclyxto is taken with these medicines: \n\n \n itraconazole ketoconazole, posaconazole, or voriconazole for fungal infections \n clarithromycin for bacterial infections \n ritonavir for HIV infection. \n\n \nWhen your Venclyxto dose has been increased to the full standard dose, check with your doctor if you \ncan start taking these medicines again. \n \n\n- you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John’s wort, used for depression. If you are not sure about \nthis, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Venclyxto. \n\n \nIt is important that you tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse about all the medicines you take, including \nprescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Your doctor may need to \nstop certain medicines when you first start taking Venclyxto and during the first five weeks when your dose \nis gradually increased to the full standard dose.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Venclyxto if: \n \n you have any kidney problems as your risk for a side effect called tumour lysis syndrome may increase \n you have liver problems as this may increase your risk for side effects. Your doctor may need to reduce \n\nyour dose of Venclyxto  \n you think you may have an infection or have had a long-lasting or repeated infection \n you are due to have a vaccine.  \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking \nthis medicine. \n \nTumour Lysis Syndrome \nSome people may develop unusual levels of some body salts (such as potassium and uric acid) in the blood \ncaused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This may lead to changes in kidney function, \nabnormal heartbeat, or seizures. This is called tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). The risk for TLS is in the first 5 \nweeks of treatment with Venclyxto.  \n \nYour doctor, pharmacist or nurse will do blood tests to check for TLS.  \n \nYour doctor may also give you medicines to help prevent the build up of uric acid in your body before you \nstart treatment with Venclyxto. \n \nDrinking plenty of water, at least 1.5 to 2 litres per day, helps to remove cancer cell breakdown products \nfrom your body through urine, and may decrease your risk of getting TLS (see section 3). \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get any of the symptoms of TLS listed in section 4. \n \nIf you are at risk of TLS you may be treated in hospital so that you can be given fluids into the vein if \nneeded, have blood tests done more often and to check for side effects. This is to see if you can continue to \ntake this medicine safely.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVenclyxto should not be used in children and adolescents. This is because it has not been studied in these age \ngroups. \n \nOther medicines and Venclyxto \n\n\n\n53 \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines as they can increase or decrease \nthe amount of venetoclax in your blood: \n \n- medicines for fungal infections – fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, or voriconazole \n- antibiotics to treat bacterial infections – ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nafcillin, or \n\nrifampicin \n- medicines to prevent seizures or to treat epilepsy – carbamazepine, phenytoin  \n- medicines for HIV infection – efavirenz, etravirine, ritonavir \n- medicines to treat raised blood pressure or angina – diltiazem, verapamil \n- medicines to lower cholesterol levels in the blood – cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam \n- a medicine used to treat a lung condition called pulmonary arterial hypertension – bosentan  \n- a medicine to treat sleep disorder (narcolepsy) known as modafinil \n- a herbal medicine known as St. John’s wort \n\n \nYour doctor may change your dose of Venclyxto. \n \nTell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines as Venclyxto may affect how they work: \n \n medicines that prevent blood clots, warfarin, dabigatran \n a medicine used to treat heart problems known as digoxin \n a medicine for cancer known as everolimus \n a medicine used to prevent organ rejection known as sirolimus \n medicines to lower cholesterol levels in the blood known as statins \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and supplements. This is because \nVenclyxto may affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way \nVenclyxto works.  \n \nVenclyxto with food and drink \nDo not eat grapefruit products, Seville oranges (bitter oranges), or starfruit (carambola) while you are taking \nVenclyxto – this includes eating them, drinking the juice or taking a supplement that might contain them. \nThis is because they can increase the amount of venetoclax in your blood. \n \nPregnancy \n- Do not get pregnant while you are taking this medicine. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant \n\nor are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before taking this \nmedicine. \n\n- Venclyxto should not be used during pregnancy. There is no information about the safety of venetoclax \nin pregnant women. \n\n \nContraception \n- Women of childbearing age must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment and for \n\nat least 30 days after receiving Venclyxto to avoid becoming pregnant. If you are using hormonal \ncontraceptive pills or devices, you must also use a barrier method of contraception (such as condoms) as \nthe effect of hormonal contraceptive pills or devices may be affected by Venclyxto.  \n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking this medicine. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed while you are taking this medicine. It is not known whether the active substance in \nVenclyxto passes into breast milk.  \n \nFertility \nBased on findings in animals, Venclyxto may cause male infertility (low or no sperm count). This may affect \nyour ability to father a child. Ask your doctor for advice on sperm storage before starting treatment with \nVenclyxto.  \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel tired after taking Venclyxto, which may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines.  \n \n \n3.

In this reporting interval, a total of 765 reports of serious infections were identified. \nSince the overall number of events of serious infections is high, the healthcare professionals should be \nexplicitly reminded of these cases. Section 4.4 of the SmPC for Venclyxto should therefore include a \nstandalone undersection entitled “infections”, including the warning statement regarding the risk of infections \nand their monitoring. The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly. \n \nIn addition, the actual format of text for recommendation for dose reduction in case of concomitant use with \nCYP3A inhibitors is considered difficult to read and respective data would be more easily readable when \ndisplayed in tabular format. The relevant information in section 4.2 of the SmPC for Venclyxto should be \namended accordingly. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for venetoclax the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk \nbalance of the medicinal product(s) containing venetoclax is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to \nthe product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
