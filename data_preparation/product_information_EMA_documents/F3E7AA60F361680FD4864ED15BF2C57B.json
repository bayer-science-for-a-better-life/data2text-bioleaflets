If strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot \nbe avoided, the abemaciclib dose should be reduced to 100 mg twice daily. \n \nIn patients who have had their dose reduced to 100 mg abemaciclib twice daily and in whom \nco-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the abemaciclib dose should be \nfurther reduced to 50 mg twice daily. \n \nIn patients who have had their dose reduced to 50 mg abemaciclib twice daily and in whom \nco-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the abemaciclib dose may be \n\n\n\n6 \n\ncontinued with close monitoring of signs of toxicity. Alternatively, the abemaciclib dose may be \nreduced to 50 mg once daily or discontinued. \n \nIf the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the abemaciclib dose should be increased to the dose used \nprior to the initiation of the CYP3A4 inhibitor (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the CYP3A4 inhibitor). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no \ndata regarding abemaciclib administration in patients with severe renal impairment, end stage renal \ndisease, or in patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). Abemaciclib should be administered with caution \nin patients with severe renal impairment, with close monitoring for signs of toxicity. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) \nhepatic impairment. In patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment, a decrease in dosing \nfrequency to once daily is recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of abemaciclib in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not \nbeen established.  \nNo data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nVerzenios is for oral use. \nThe dose can be taken with or without food. It should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice \n(see section 4.5). \nPatients should take the doses at approximately the same times every day. \nThe tablet should be swallowed whole (patients should not chew, crush, or split tablets before \nswallowing). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeutropenia \n \nNeutropenia was reported in patients receiving abemaciclib. Dose modification is recommended for \npatients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (see section 4.2). Fatal events occurred in <1% of \npatients. Patients should be instructed to report any episode of fever to their healthcare provider. \n \nInfections/infestations \n \nInfections were reported in patients receiving abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy at a higher rate than \nin patients treated with placebo plus endocrine therapy. Lung infection was reported in patients \nreceiving abemaciclib without concurrent neutropenia. Fatal events occurred in <1% of patients. \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated as medically \nappropriate. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n \nVenous thromboembolic events were reported in 5.3% of patients treated with abemaciclib plus \nfulvestrant or aromatase inhibitors, compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo plus fulvestrant \nor aromatase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis \nand pulmonary embolism and treated as medically appropriate.  \n \nIncreased aminotransferases \n \nIncreases in ALT and AST were reported in patients receiving abemaciclib. Based on the level of ALT \nor AST elevation, abemaciclib may require dose modification (see section 4.2).  \n \nDiarrhoea \n \nDiarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction. Across clinical studies, median time to onset of the \nfirst diarrhoea event was approximately 6 to 8 days, and median duration of diarrhoea was 9 to \n12 days (Grade 2) and 6 to 8 days (Grade 3). Diarrhoea can be associated with dehydration. Patients \nshould start treatment with antidiarrhoeal agents such as loperamide at the first sign of loose stools, \nincrease oral fluids and notify their healthcare provider. Dose modification is recommended for \npatients who develop ≥ Grade 2 diarrhoea (see section 4.2).  \n \nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis was reported in patients receiving abemaciclib. Monitor \npatients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis and treat as medically appropriate. \nBased on the grade of ILD/pneumonitis, abemaciclib may require dose modification (see section 4.2). \nPermanently discontinue abemaciclib in patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis. \n \nConcomitant use of inducers of CYP3A4 \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to the risk of decreased efficacy of \nabemaciclib (see section 4.5). \n \nVisceral crisis \n \nThere are no data on the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in patients with visceral crisis. \n \nLactose \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib  \n \nAbemaciclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nCo-administration of abemaciclib with CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase plasma concentrations of \nabemaciclib. In patients with advanced and/or metastatic cancer, co-administration of the CYP3A4 \ninhibitor clarithromycin resulted in a 3.4-fold increase in the plasma exposure of abemaciclib and a \n\n\n\n8 \n\n2.5-fold increase in the combined unbound potency adjusted plasma exposure of abemaciclib and its \nactive metabolites. \n \nUse of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors together with abemaciclib should be avoided. If strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitors need to be co-administered, the dose of abemaciclib should be reduced (see section 4.2), \nfollowed by careful monitoring of toxicity. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but not \nlimited to: clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole or \nvoriconazole. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice.  \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients treated with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. There \nshould, however, be close monitoring for signs of toxicity. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nCo-administration of abemaciclib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin decreased the plasma \nconcentration of abemaciclib by 95% and unbound potency adjusted plasma concentration of \nabemaciclib plus its active metabolites by 77% based on AUC0-∞. Concomitant use of strong \nCYP3A4 inducers (including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s \nwort) should be avoided due to the risk of decreased efficacy of abemaciclib. \n \nEffects of abemaciclib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products  \n \nMedicinal products that are substrates of transporters \nAbemaciclib and its major active metabolites inhibit the renal transporters organic cation transporter 2 \n(OCT2), multidrug and extrusion toxin protein (MATE1), and MATE2-K. In vivo interactions of \nabemaciclib with clinically relevant substrates of these transporters, such as dofetilide or creatinine, \nmay occur (see section 4.8). In a clinical drug interaction study with metformin (substrate of OCT2, \nMATE1 and 2) co-administered with 400 mg abemaciclib, a small but not clinically relevant increase \n(37%) in metformin plasma exposure was observed. This was found to be due to reduced renal \nsecretion with unaffected glomerular filtration. \n \nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of abemaciclib and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate \nloperamide resulted in an increase in loperamide plasma exposure of 9% based on AUC0-∞ and 35% \nbased on Cmax. This was not considered to be clinically relevant. However, based on the in vitro \ninhibition of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) observed with abemaciclib, in vivo \ninteractions of abemaciclib with narrow therapeutic index substrates of these transporters, such as \ndigoxin or dabigatran etexilate, may occur. \n \nIn a clinical study in patients with breast cancer, there was no clinically-relevant pharmacokinetic drug \ninteraction between abemaciclib and anastrozole, fulvestrant, exemestane, letrozole or tamoxifen. \n \nIt is currently unknown whether abemaciclib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting \nhormonal contraceptives. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use highly effective contraception methods (e.g. \ndouble-barrier contraception) during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after completing therapy (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of abemaciclib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Verzenios is not recommended during pregnancy and in \nwomen of child-bearing potential not using contraception. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether abemaciclib is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Patients receiving abemaciclib should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of abemaciclib on fertility in humans is unknown. In animal studies, no effects on female \nreproductive organs were observed. However, cytotoxic effects to the male reproductive tract in rats \nand dogs indicate that abemaciclib may impair fertility in males (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVerzenios has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to \nbe cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue or dizziness during \ntreatment with Verzenios (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly occurring adverse reactions are diarrhoea, infections, neutropenia, anaemia, \nfatigue, nausea, vomiting and decreased appetite. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the following table, adverse reactions are listed in order of MedDRA body system organ class and \nfrequency. Frequency gradings are: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 7.

The median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 29 to \n33 days, and median time to resolution was 11 to 15 days.  Febrile neutropenia was reported in 0.9% \npatients. Dose modification is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nDiarrhoea \nDiarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse reaction (see Table 7). Incidence was greatest \nduring the first month of abemaciclib treatment and was lower subsequently. The median time to onset \n\n\n\n11 \n\nof the first diarrhoea event was approximately 6 to 8 days across studies, and the median duration of \ndiarrhoea was 9 to 12 days (Grade 2) and 6 to 8 days (Grade 3) across studies. Diarrhoea returned to \nbaseline or lesser grade with supportive treatment such as loperamide and/or dose adjustment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nIncreased aminotransferases \nIn patients receiving abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, ALT and \nAST elevations were reported frequently (15.1% and 14.2%, respectively). Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST \nelevations (based on laboratory findings) were reported in 6.1% and 4.2% patients. The median time to \nonset of Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation was 57 to 61 days, and median time to resolution was 14 days. \nThe median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 AST elevation was 71 to 185 days, and median time to \nresolution was 13 to 15 days. Dose modification is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or \n4 ALT or AST increase (see section 4.2). \n \nCreatinine \nAlthough not an adverse reaction, abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine in 98.3% \nof patients (based on laboratory findings), 1.9% Grade 3 or 4 (based on laboratory findings). In \npatients receiving an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant alone, 78.4% reported an increase in serum \ncreatinine (all laboratory grades). Abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to \ninhibition of renal tubular secretion transporters without affecting glomerular function (as measured by \niohexol clearance) (see section 4.5). In clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine occurred within \nthe first month of abemaciclib dosing, remained elevated but stable through the treatment period, were \nreversible upon treatment discontinuation, and were not accompanied by changes in markers of renal \nfunction, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cystatin C, or calculated glomerular filtration rate based \non cystatin C. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of an abemaciclib overdose, fatigue and diarrhoea may occur. General supportive care \nshould be provided. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinases inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE50 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAbemaciclib is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and \nCDK6), and most active against Cyclin D1/CDK4 in enzymatic assays. Abemaciclib prevents \nretinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation, blocking cell cycle progression from the G1 to the \nS-phase of cell division, leading to suppression of tumour growth. In oestrogen receptor-positive \nbreast cancer cell lines, sustained target inhibition with abemaciclib prevented rebound of Rb \nphosphorylation resulting in cell senescence and apoptosis. In vitro, Rb-negative and Rb-depleted \ncancer cell lines are generally less sensitive to abemaciclib. In breast cancer xenograft models, \nabemaciclib dosed daily without interruption at clinically relevant concentrations alone or in \ncombination with anti-oestrogens resulted in reduction of tumour size. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn cancer patients, abemaciclib inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 as indicated by inhibition of \nphosphorylation of Rb and topoisomerase II alpha, which results in cell cycle inhibition upstream of \nthe G1 restriction point. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nThe effect of abemaciclib on the QTcF interval was evaluated in 144 patients with advanced cancer. \nNo large change (that is, >20 ms) in the QTcF interval was detected at the mean observed maximal \nsteady state abemaciclib concentration following a therapeutic dosing schedule. \nIn an exposure-response analysis in healthy subjects at exposures comparable to a 200 mg twice-daily \ndose, abemaciclib did not prolong the QTcF interval to any clinically relevant extent. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRandomised Phase 3 Study MONARCH 3: Verzenios in combination with aromatase inhibitors \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Verzenios in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole or \nletrozole) was evaluated in MONARCH 3, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 \nstudy in women with HR positive, HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who \nhad not received prior systemic therapy in this disease setting. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio \nto receive Verzenios 150 mg twice daily plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor given daily at the \nrecommended dose versus placebo plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor according to the same \nschedule. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated \naccording to RECIST 1.1; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), \nclinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall survival (OS). \n \nThe median age of patients enrolled was 63 years (range 32-88). Approximately 39% of patients had \nreceived chemotherapy and 44% had received antihormonal therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting. \nPatients with prior (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy must have completed this therapy at least \n12 months before study randomisation. The majority of patients (96%) had metastatic disease at \nbaseline. Approximately 22% of patients had bone-only disease, and 53% patients had visceral \nmetastases.  \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint of improving PFS.

These results correspond \nto a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 46% for patients \ntreated with abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor. \n \nOverall survival was not mature at the final PFS analysis (93 events observed across the two arms). \nThe HR was 1.057 (95% CI: 0.683, 1.633), p=0.8017. \n \nA series of prespecified subgroup PFS analyses showed consistent results across patient subgroups \nincluding age (<65 or ≥65 years), disease site, disease setting (de novo metastatic vs recurrent \nmetastatic vs locally advanced recurrent), presence of measurable disease, progesterone receptor \nstatus, and baseline ECOG performance status. A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death \nwas observed in patients with visceral disease, (HR of 0.567 [95% CI: 0.407, 0.789]), median PFS \n21.6 months versus 14.0 months; in patients with bone-only disease (HR 0.565, [95% CI: 0.306, \n1.044]); and in patients with measurable disease (HR 0.517, [95% CI: 0.392, 0.681]). \n \nRandomised Phase 3 Study MONARCH 2: Verzenios in combination with fulvestrant \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Verzenios in combination with fulvestrant was evaluated in MONARCH 2, \na randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in women with HR positive, HER2 \nnegative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to \nreceive Verzenios 150 mg twice daily plus fulvestrant 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an \nadditional 500 mg dose given two weeks after the initial dose, versus placebo plus fulvestrant \n\n\n\n15 \n\naccording to the same schedule. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated \naccording to RECIST 1.1; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), \nclinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall survival (OS). \n \nThe median age of patients enrolled was 60 years (range, 32-91 years). In each treatment arm the \nmajority of patients were white, and had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 17% of \npatients were pre/perimenopausal on ovarian suppression with a GnRH agonist. Approximately 56% \npatients had visceral metastases. Approximately 25% of patients had primary endocrine resistance \n(progression on endocrine therapy within the first 2 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy or within the \nfirst 6 months of first line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer) and for the majority, \nendocrine resistance developed later. 59% of patients had most recent endocrine therapy in the \n(neo)adjuvant setting, and 38% in metastatic setting. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint of improving PFS.

In the therapeutic dose range of 50-200 mg, the increase in plasma exposure \n(AUC) and Cmax is approximately dose proportional. Steady state was achieved within 5 days \nfollowing repeated twice daily dosing, and abemaciclib accumulated with a geometric mean \naccumulation ratio of 3.7 (58% CV) and 5.8 (65% CV) based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. A \nhigh-fat meal increased combined AUC of abemaciclib and its active metabolites by 9% and increased \nCmax by 26%. These changes were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, abemaciclib can \nbe taken with or without food. \n \nDistribution \n \nAbemaciclib is highly bound to plasma proteins in humans (mean bound fraction approximately 96% \nto 98%). The geometric mean systemic volume of distribution is approximately 750 L (69% CV), \nindicating distribution of abemaciclib into tissues. \n \nConcentrations of abemaciclib and its active metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid are comparable to \nunbound plasma concentrations.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nHepatic metabolism is the main route of clearance for abemaciclib. Abemaciclib is metabolised to \nseveral metabolites primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The primary biotransformation is \nhydroxylation to a metabolite that circulates with an AUC that is 77% of parent drug. In addition, N-\ndesethyl and N-desethylhydroxy metabolites circulate at AUCs that are 39% and 15% of parent drug. \nThese circulating metabolites are active with similar potency to abemaciclib. \n \nElimination \n \nThe geometric mean hepatic clearance (CL) of abemaciclib was 21.8 L/h (39.8% CV), and the mean \nplasma elimination half-life for abemaciclib in patients was 24.8 hours (52.1% CV). After a single oral \ndose of [14C] -abemaciclib, approximately 81% of the dose was excreted in faeces and 3.4% excreted \nin urine. The majority of the dose eliminated in faeces was metabolites.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge, gender, and body weight \nAge, gender, and body weight had no effect on the exposure of abemaciclib in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients with cancer (135 males and 859 females; age range 24-91 years; \nand body weight range 36-175 kg). \n \nHepatic impairment \nAbemaciclib is metabolised in the liver. Mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic \nimpairment had no effect on the exposure of abemaciclib. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh C), the AUC0-∞ of abemaciclib and potency adjusted unbound abemaciclib plus its active \nmetabolites increased 2.1-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively. The half-life of abemaciclib increased from \n24 to 55 hours (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal clearance of abemaciclib and its metabolites is minor. Mild and moderate renal impairment had \nno effect on the exposure of abemaciclib. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment, \nend stage renal disease or in patients on dialysis. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe primary target organ findings of potential relevance to humans included gastrointestinal and \nhaematolymphopoietic organ effects in rats and dogs in studies up to 13 weeks duration. Effects in \nlung and skeletal muscle occurred only in rats at exposure levels approximately 2-fold higher than \nhuman exposure levels and effects in kidney occurred only in rats at exposure levels approximately 6-\nfold higher than human exposure levels. Complete or partial recovery was observed for all target \norgans at the end of the 28-day recovery period. \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nAbemaciclib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in \nan in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was not \nclastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nSpecific animal studies to test abemaciclib for carcinogenic potential have not been performed. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity \n \nAbemaciclib was teratogenic and caused decreased foetal weight at maternal exposures similar to the \nrecommended human dose. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take Verzenios  \n3. How to take Verzenios  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Verzenios  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Verzenios is and what it is used for \n \nVerzenios is a cancer medicine containing the active substance abemaciclib. \n \nAbemaciclib blocks the effects of proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6. These proteins are \nabnormally active in some cancer cells and make them grow out of control. Blocking the action of \nthese proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells, shrink the tumour and delay progression of the \ncancer.  \n \nVerzenios is used to treat women with certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive \n(HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-)) which have spread beyond the \noriginal tumour and/or to other organs. It is given together with hormonal therapies, such as aromatase \ninhibitors or fulvestrant. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Verzenios  \n \nDo not take Verzenios: \n- if you are allergic to abemaciclib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nVerzenios may: \n- reduce the number of your white blood cells, and you may be at greater risk of getting an \n\ninfection. Serious infections such as lung infections can be life-threatening; \n- cause blood clots in the veins; \n- cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs; \n\n\n\n43 \n\n- affect the way your liver works; \n- cause diarrhoea. At the first sign of diarrhoea, start treatment with antidiarrhoeal agents, such as \n\nloperamide. Drink plenty of fluids. \n \nSee section 4 “Possible side effects”, and talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms.  \n \nWhat your doctor will check before and during your treatment \nYou will have regular blood tests before and during treatment to check whether Verzenios affects your \nblood (white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets) or the concentration in your blood of enzymes from \nyour liver.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVerzenios is not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Verzenios \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nIn particular, tell you doctor or pharmacist before taking Verzenios if you are taking the following: \n• medicines that may increase the concentration of Verzenios in the blood: \n\no Clarithromycin (antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections) \no Itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (used to treat fungal \n\ninfections) \no Lopinavir/ritonavir (used to treat HIV/AIDS) \no Digoxin (used to treat heart disorders)  \no Dabigatran etexilate (used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots) \n\n• medicines that may reduce the effectiveness of Verzenios: \no Carbamazepine (anti-epileptic used to treat seizures or fits) \no Rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB) \no Phenytoin (used to treat seizures) \no St. John’s wort (a herbal product used to treat mild depression and anxiety) \n\n \nVerzenios with food and drink \nAvoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while you are taking the medicine as they may increase the \nconcentration of Verzenios in the blood. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nDiscuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you may become pregnant. If \nyou are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nYou should not use Verzenios if you are pregnant. \n \nYou should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Verzenios.  \n \nIf you are able to have children, you should use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double –barrier \ncontraception such as condom and diaphragm) during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after \ncompleting therapy.  \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you become pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed while taking Verzenios. It is not known if Verzenios passes into breast \nmilk. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nDriving and using machines \nTiredness and dizziness are very common side effects. If you feel unusually tired or dizzy, take special \ncare when driving or using machines. \n \nVerzenios contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nVerzenios contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to take Verzenios \n \nRecommended dose \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nWhen given together with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant to treat your breast cancer, the \nrecommended dose of Verzenios is 150 mg taken by mouth twice daily. \n \nIf you get certain side effects while you are taking Verzenios your doctor may lower your dose or stop \ntreatment temporarily or permanently.  \n \nWhen and how to take Verzenios \nTake Verzenios twice daily, at about the same time every day, preferably in the morning and evening, \nso there is enough medicine in your body all the time. \n \nYou can take the tablets either with or without food, just avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice (see \nsection 2 “Verzenios with food and drink”). \n \nSwallow the tablet whole with a glass of water. Do not chew, crush or split the tablets before \nswallowing. \n \nHow long to take Verzenios \nTake Verzenios continuously for as long as your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you take more Verzenios than you should \nIf you take too many tablets, or if someone else takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for \nadvice.

Do not take \na double dose to make up for the forgotten or vomited dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Verzenios \nDo not stop taking Verzenios unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n4.
