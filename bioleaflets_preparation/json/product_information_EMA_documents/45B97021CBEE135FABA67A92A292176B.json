This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nReblozyl 25 mg powder for solution for injection \nReblozyl 75 mg powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nReblozyl 25 mg powder for solution for injection \nEach vial contains 25 mg of luspatercept. After reconstitution, each mL of solution contains 50 mg \nluspatercept. \n \nReblozyl 75 mg powder for solution for injection \nEach vial contains 75 mg of luspatercept. After reconstitution, each mL of solution contains 50 mg \nluspatercept. \n \nLuspatercept is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nWhite to off-white lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to \nvery low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who \nhad an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nReblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia associated \nwith beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nReblozyl treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in treatment of haematological \ndiseases. \n \nPosology \nPrior to each Reblozyl administration, the haemoglobin (Hb) level of patients should be assessed. In \ncase of a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion occurring prior to dosing, the pre-transfusion Hb level must \nbe considered for dosing purposes. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndromes \nThe recommended starting dose of Reblozyl is 1.0 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nIn patients who are not RBC transfusion-free after at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.0 mg/kg \nstarting dose, the dose should be increased to 1.33 mg/kg. If patients are not RBC transfusion-free \nafter at least 2 consecutive doses at the 1.33 mg/kg dose level, the dose should be increased to \n1.75 mg/kg. The dose increase should not occur more frequently than every 6 weeks \n(2 administrations) and should not exceed the maximum dose of 1.75 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The dose \nshould not be increased immediately after a dose delay. For patients with a pre-dose Hb level of \n> 9 g/dL and who have not yet achieved transfusion independence, a dose increase may be required at \nthe physician’s discretion; the risk of Hb increasing above the target threshold with concomitant \ntransfusion cannot be excluded. \n \nIf a patient loses response (i.e., transfusion independence), the dose should be increased by one dose \nlevel. \n \n-thalassaemia \nThe recommended starting dose of Reblozyl is 1.0 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks. \n \nIn patients who do not achieve a response, defined as a reduction in RBC transfusion burden of at least \na third after ≥ 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks), at the 1.0 mg/kg starting dose, the dose should be \nincreased to 1.25 mg/kg. The dose should not be increased beyond the maximum dose of 1.25 mg/kg \nevery 3 weeks. \n \nIf a patient loses response (if the RBC transfusion burden increases again after an initial response) the \ndose should be increased by one dose level. \n \nMDS and -thalassaemia \n \nDose reduction and dose delay  \nIn case of Hb increase > 2 g/dL within 3 weeks of luspatercept treatment in absence of transfusion, the \nReblozyl dose should be reduced by one dose level. \n \nIf the Hb is ≥ 11.5 g/dL in the absence of transfusion for at least 3 weeks, the dose should be delayed \nuntil the Hb is ≤ 11.0 g/dL. If there is also a concomitant rapid increase in Hb (> 2 g/dL within \n3 weeks in absence of transfusion), a dose reduction to one step down (minimum 0.8 mg/kg) should be \nconsidered after the dose delay. \n \nDose should not be reduced below 0.8 mg/kg. \n \nDose reductions during treatment with luspatercept are provided below. \n \nTable 1: Dose reductions for MDS \n\nCurrent dose Dose reduction \n1.75 mg/kg 1.33 mg/kg\n1.33 mg/kg 1 mg/kg\n\n1 mg/kg 0.8 mg/kg\n \nTable 2: Dose reductions for -thalassaemia \n\nCurrent dose Dose reduction \n1.25 mg/kg 1 mg/kg\n\n1 mg/kg 0.8 mg/kg\n \nIf patients experience persistent treatment-related Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (see section \n4.8), the treatment should be delayed until toxicity has improved or returned to baseline. \n \nAfter a dose delay, patients should be re-started at their previous dose or at reduced dose as per dose \nreduction guidance.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nMissed doses \nIn case of a missed or delayed scheduled treatment administration, the patient should be administered \nReblozyl as soon as possible and dosing continued as prescribed with at least 3 weeks between doses. \n \nPatients experiencing a loss of response \nIf patients experience a loss of response to Reblozyl, causative factors (e.g. a bleeding event) should \nbe assessed. If typical causes for a loss of haematological response are excluded, dose increase should \nbe considered as described above for the respective indication being treated. \n \nDiscontinuation \nReblozyl should be discontinued if patients do not experience a reduction in transfusion burden after \n9 weeks of treatment (3 doses) at the maximum dose level if no alternative explanations for response \nfailure are found (e.g. bleeding, surgery, other concomitant illnesses) or if unacceptable toxicity occurs \nat any time. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo starting dose adjustment is required for Reblozyl (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo starting dose adjustment is required for patients with total bilirubin (BIL) > upper limit of normal \n(ULN) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 3 x ULN (see \nsection 5.2). No specific dose recommendation can be made for patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN \nor liver injury CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 due to lack of data (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo starting dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated \nglomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 90 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). No specific dose recommendation \ncan be made for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) due to lack of \nclinical data (see section 5.2). Patients with renal impairment at baseline should be closely monitored \nfor renal function as per standard of care. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Reblozyl in the paediatric population for the indication of myelodysplastic \nsyndromes, or in paediatric patients less than 6 months of age in -thalassaemia. For non-clinical data, \nsee section 5.3. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Reblozyl in the paediatric patients aged from 6 months to less than 18 years \nhave not yet been established in -thalassaemia. For non-clinical data, see section 5.3. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor subcutaneous use. \n \nAfter reconstitution, Reblozyl solution should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or \nabdomen. The exact total dosing volume of the reconstituted solution required for the patient should \nbe calculated and slowly withdrawn from the single-dose vial(s) into a syringe. \n \nThe recommended maximum volume of medicinal product per injection site is 1.2 mL. If more than \n1.2 mL is required, the total volume should be divided into separate similar volume injections and \nadministered across separate sites. \n \nIf multiple injections are required, a new syringe and needle must be used for each subcutaneous \ninjection. No more than one dose from a vial should be administered. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nIf the Reblozyl solution has been refrigerated after reconstitution, it should be removed from the \nrefrigerator 15-30 minutes prior to injection to allow it to reach room temperature. This will allow for \na more comfortable injection. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn -thalassaemia patients, thromboembolic events (TEEs) were reported in 3.6% (8/223) of patients \ntreated with luspatercept in a controlled clinical study. Reported TEEs included deep vein thrombosis \n(DVT), portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli and ischaemic stroke (see section 4.8). All patients \nwith TEEs were splenectomised and had at least one other risk factor for developing TEE (e.g. history \nof thrombocytosis or concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy). The occurrence of TEE was \nnot correlated with elevated Hb levels. The potential benefit of treatment with luspatercept should be \nweighed against the potential risk of TEEs in -thalassaemia patients with a splenectomy and other \nrisk factors for developing TEE. Thromboprophylaxis according to current clinical guidelines should \nbe considered in patients with -thalassaemia at higher risk. \n \nIncreased blood pressure \nIn controlled clinical studies in MDS and -thalassaemia, patients treated with luspatercept had an \naverage increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg from baseline (see section 4.8). \nBlood pressure should be monitored prior to each luspatercept administration. In case of persistent \nhypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension, patients should be treated for hypertension \nas per current clinical guidelines. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal clinical interaction studies have been performed. Concurrent use of iron-chelating agents \nhad no effect on luspatercept pharmacokinetics. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with Reblozyl \nand for at least 3 months after the last dose. Prior to starting treatment with Reblozyl, a pregnancy test \nhas to be performed for women of childbearing potential. \n \nPregnancy \nTreatment with Reblozyl should not be started if the woman is pregnant (see section 4.3). \nThere are no data from the use of Reblozyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Reblozyl is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nIf a patient becomes pregnant, Reblozyl should be discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether luspatercept or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Luspatercept was \ndetected in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Because of the unknown adverse effects of \nluspatercept in newborns/infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nduring therapy with Reblozyl and for 3 months after the last dose or to discontinue Reblozyl therapy, \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThe effect of luspatercept on fertility in humans is unknown. Based on findings in animals, \nluspatercept may compromise female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nReblozyl may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The ability to react \nwhen performing these tasks may be impaired due to risks of fatigue, vertigo, dizziness or syncope \n(see section 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they know of any \nimpact on their ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nMyelodysplastic syndromes \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Reblozyl (at least 15% of \npatients) were fatigue, diarrhoea, asthenia, nausea, dizziness, back pain and headache. The most \ncommonly reported Grade 3 or higher adverse drug reactions (at least 2% of patients) included \nsyncope/presyncope, fatigue, hypertension and asthenia. The most commonly reported serious adverse \ndrug reactions (at least 2% of patients) were urinary tract infection, back pain and syncope. \n \nAsthenia, fatigue, dizziness and headache occurred more frequently during the first 3 months of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.0% of patients treated with \nluspatercept. The adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in the luspatercept treatment \narm were fatigue and headache.  \n \n-thalassaemia \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Reblozyl (at least 15% of \npatients) were headache, bone pain and arthralgia. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or higher \nadverse drug reaction was hyperuricaemia. The most serious adverse reactions reported included \nthromboembolic events of deep vein thrombosis, ischaemic stroke portal vein thrombosis and \npulmonary embolism (see section 4.4). \n \nBone pain, asthenia, fatigue, dizziness and headache occurred more frequently during the first \n3 months of treatment. \n \nTreatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with \nluspatercept. The adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in the luspatercept treatment \narm were arthralgia, back pain, bone pain  and headache . \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe highest frequency for each adverse reaction that was observed and reported in the two pivotal \nstudies in MDS and -thalassaemia is shown in Table 3 below.

In β-thalassaemia patients \ntreated with luspatercept, bone pain was most common in the first 3 months (16.6%) compared to \nmonths 4-6 (3.7%). Most events (41/44 events) were Grade 1-2, with 3 events Grade 3. One of the \n44 events was serious, and 1 event led to treatment discontinuation.  \n \nArthralgia \nArthralgia was reported in 19.3% of β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 11.9%) \nand in 5.2% of MDS patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 11.8%). In the β-thalassaemia patients \ntreated with luspatercept, arthralgia led to treatment discontinuation in 2 patients (0.9%). \n \nHypertension \nPatients treated with luspatercept had an average increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of \n5 mmHg from baseline not observed in patients receiving placebo. Hypertension was reported in 8.5% \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nof MDS patients treated with luspatercept (placebo 9.2%) and in 8.1% of β-thalassaemia patients \ntreated with luspatercept (placebo 2.8%). See section 4.4. \n \nIn MDS patients, Grade 3 events were reported for 5 patients (3.3%) treated with luspatercept and in \n3 patients (3.9%) receiving placebo. No patient discontinued due to hypertension.  \n \nIn β-thalassaemia patients, Grade 3 events were reported in 4 patients (1.8%) treated with luspatercept \n(0.0% placebo). No patient discontinued due to hypertension. See section 4.4. \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity-type reactions (including eyelid oedema, drug hypersensitivity, swelling face, \nperiorbital oedema, face oedema, angioedema, lip swelling, drug eruption) were reported in 4.6% of \nMDS (2.6% placebo) and 4.5% of β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept (1.8% placebo). In \nclinical studies, all events were Grade 1/2. In β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept, \nhypersensitivity led to treatment discontinuation in 1 patient (0.4%). \n \nInjection site reactions \nInjection site reactions (including injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, injection site swelling \nand injection site rash) were reported in 3.9% of MDS (placebo 0.0%) and in 2.2% of β-thalassaemia \npatients receiving luspatercept (placebo 1.8%). In clinical studies, all events were Grade 1 and none \nled to discontinuation. \n \nThromboembolic events \nThromboembolic events (including deep vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, ischaemic stroke \nand pulmonary embolism) occurred in 3.6% of β-thalassaemia patients receiving luspatercept (placebo \n0.9%). All events were reported in patients who had undergone splenectomy and had at least one other \nrisk factor. No difference in TEEs was observed between luspatercept and placebo arms in MDS \npatients. See section 4.4. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn clinical studies in MDS, an analysis of 260 MDS patients who were treated with luspatercept and \nwho were evaluable for the presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies showed that 23 (8.8%) MDS \npatients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-luspatercept antibodies, including 9 (3.5%) MDS \npatients who had neutralising antibodies against luspatercept. \n \nIn clinical studies in -thalassaemia, an analysis of 284 -thalassaemia patients who were treated with \nluspatercept and who were evaluable for the presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies showed that \n4 (1.4%) -thalassaemia patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-luspatercept antibodies, \nincluding 2 (0.7%) -thalassaemia patients who had neutralising antibodies against luspatercept. \n \nLuspatercept serum concentration tended to decrease in the presence of neutralising antibodies. There \nwere no severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions reported for patients with anti-luspatercept \nantibodies. There was no association between hypersensitivity type reactions or injection site reactions \nand presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose with luspatercept may cause an increase of Hb values above the desired level. In the event of \nan overdose, treatment with luspatercept should be delayed until Hb is ≤ 11 g/dL. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antianaemic preparations, other antianaemic preparations, ATC code: \nB03XA06.  \n \nMechanism of action \nLuspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent, is a recombinant fusion protein that binds selected \ntransforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands \n(e.g. GDF-11, activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid maturation \nthrough differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. Smad2/3 \nsignalling is abnormally high in disease models characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis, i.e. MDS \nand β-thalassaemia, and in the bone marrow of MDS patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMyelodysplastic syndromes \nThe efficacy and safety of luspatercept were evaluated in a Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled study MEDALIST (ACE-536-MDS-001) in adult patients with \nanaemia requiring RBC transfusions (≥ 2 units/8 weeks) due to International Prognostic Scoring \nSystem-Revised (IPSS-R) very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS who have ring sideroblasts \n(≥ 15%). Patients were required to have either received prior treatment with an erythropoiesis-\nstimulating agent (ESA) with inadequate response, to be ineligible for ESAs (determined to be \nunlikely to respond to ESA treatment with serum erythropoietin (EPO) > 200 U/L), or intolerant to \nESA treatment. Patients with deletion 5q (del5q) MDS were excluded from the study. \n \nPatients in both arms were treated for 24 weeks, then continued treatment if they had demonstrated \nclinical benefit and absence of disease progression. The study was unblinded for analyses when all \npatients had at least received 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued treatment. \n \nA total of 229 patients were randomised to receive luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg (n=153) or placebo (n=76) \nsubcutaneously every 3 weeks. A total of 128 (83.7%) and 68 (89.5%) patients receiving luspatercept \nand placebo respectively completed 24 weeks of treatment. A total of 78 (51%) and 12 (15.8%) \npatients receiving luspatercept and placebo respectively completed 48 weeks of treatment. Dose \ntitration up to 1.75 mg/kg was allowed. Dose could be delayed or reduced depending upon Hb level. \nAll patients were eligible to receive best supportive care (BSC), which included RBC transfusions, \niron-chelating agents, use of antibiotic, antiviral and antifungal therapy, and nutritional support, as \nneeded.

Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis suggests that the absorption of luspatercept into the \ncirculation is linear over the range of studied doses, and the absorption is not significantly affected by \nthe subcutaneous injection location (upper arm, thigh or abdomen). Interindividual variability in AUC \nwas approximately 38% in MDS patients and 36% in -thalassaemia patients. \n \nDistribution \nAt the recommended doses, the mean apparent volume of distribution was 9.68 L for MDS patients \nand 7.08 L for -thalassaemia patients. The small volume of distribution indicates that luspatercept is \nconfined primarily in extracellular fluids, consistent with its large molecular mass. \n \nBiotransformation \nLuspatercept is expected to be catabolised into amino acids by general protein degradation process. \n \nElimination \nLuspatercept is not expected to be excreted into urine due to its large molecular mass that is above the \nglomerular filtration size exclusion threshold. At the recommended doses, the mean apparent total \nclearance was 0.516 L/day for MDS patients and 0.437 L/day for β-thalassaemia. The mean half-life in \nserum was approximately 13 days for MDS patients and 11 days for -thalassaemia patients. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe increase of luspatercept Cmax and AUC in serum is approximately proportional to increases in dose \nfrom 0.125 to 1.75 mg/kg. Luspatercept clearance was independent of dose or time. \n \nWhen administered every three weeks, luspatercept serum concentration reaches the steady state after \n3 doses, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.5. \n \nHaemoglobin response \nIn patients who received < 4 units of RBC transfusion within 8 weeks prior to the study, Hb increased \nwithin 7 days of treatment initiation and the increase correlated with the time to reach luspatercept \nCmax. The greatest mean Hb increase was observed after the first dose, with additional smaller \nincreases observed after subsequent doses. Hb levels returned to baseline value approximately 6 to \n8 weeks from the last dose (0.6 to 1.75 mg/kg). Increasing luspatercept serum exposure (AUC) was \nassociated with a greater Hb increase in patients with MDS or -thalassaemia. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nPopulation PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with ages ranging from 18 to 95 years old, \nwith a median age of 72 years for MDS patients and of 32 years for -thalassaemia patients. No \nclinically significant difference in AUC or clearance was found across age groups (< 65, 65-74, and \n≥ 75 years for MDS patients; 18-23, 24-31, 32-41, and 42-66 years for -thalassaemia patients). \n \nHepatic impairment \nPopulation PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with normal hepatic function (BIL, ALT, \nand AST ≤ ULN; N = 207), mild hepatic impairment (BIL > 1 – 1.5 x ULN, and ALT or AST > ULN; \nN = 160), moderate hepatic impairment (BIL > 1.5 – 3 x ULN, any ALT or AST; N = 138), or severe \nhepatic impairment (BIL > 3 x ULN, any ALT or AST; N = 40) as defined by the National Cancer \nInstitute criteria of hepatic dysfunction. Effects of hepatic function categories, elevated liver enzymes \n(ALT or AST, up to 3 x ULN) and elevated total BIL (4 – 246 mol/L) on luspatercept clearance were \nnot observed. No clinically significant difference in mean steady state Cmax and AUC was found across \nhepatic function groups. PK data are insufficient for patients with liver enzymes (ALT or AST) \n≥ 3 x ULN. \n \nRenal impairment \nPopulation PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with normal renal function (eGFR \n≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; N = 315), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2; N = 171), or \nmoderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; N = 59). No clinically significant \ndifference in mean steady state Cmax and AUC was found across renal function groups. PK data are not \navailable for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end-stage kidney \ndisease. \n \nOther intrinsic factors \nThe following population characteristics have no clinically significant effect on luspatercept AUC or \nclearance: sex and race (Asian versus White). \n \nThe following baseline disease characteristics had no clinically significant effect on luspatercept \nclearance: serum erythropoietin level, RBC transfusion burden, MDS ring sideroblasts, β-thalassaemia \ngenotype (β0/β0 versus non-β0/β0) and splenectomy. \n \nThe volume of distribution and clearance of luspatercept increased with increase of body weight, \nsupporting the body weight-based dosing regimen. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle and repeat-dose toxicity \nFollowing repeated administration of luspatercept in rats, toxicities included: membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis; congestion, necrosis and/or mineralisation of the adrenal glands; hepatocellular \nvacuolation and necrosis; mineralisation of the glandular stomach; and decreased heart and lung \nweights with no associated histology findings. A clinical observation of swollen hindlimbs/feet was \nnoted in several studies in rats and rabbits (including juvenile and reproductive toxicity studies). In \none juvenile rat, this correlated histopathologically with new bone formation, fibrosis, and \ninflammation. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis was also seen in monkeys. Additional \ntoxicities in monkeys included: vascular degeneration and inflammatory infiltrates in the choroid \nplexus. \n \nFor the 6-month toxicity study, the longest duration study in monkeys, the no-observed-adverse-effect \nlevel (NOAEL) was 0.3 mg/kg (0.3-fold of clinical exposure at 1.75 mg/kg every 3 weeks). A NOAEL \nwas not identified in rats and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) in the rat 3-month \nstudy was 1 mg/kg (0.9-fold of clinical exposure at 1.75 mg/kg every 3 weeks). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \nNeither carcinogenicity nor mutagenicity studies with luspatercept have been conducted. \nHaematological malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats examined in the highest dose group \n(10 mg/kg) in the definitive juvenile toxicity study. The occurrence of these tumours in young animals \nis unusual and the relationship to luspatercept therapy cannot be ruled out. At the 10 mg/kg dose, at \nwhich tumours were observed, the exposure represents an exposure multiple of approximately 4 times \nthe estimated exposure at a clinical dose of 1.75 mg/kg every three weeks. \n \nNo other proliferative or pre-neoplastic lesions, attributable to luspatercept, have been observed in any \nspecies in other non-clinical safety studies conducted with luspatercept, including the 6-month study in \nmonkeys. \n \nFertility \nIn a fertility study in rats, administration of luspatercept to females at doses higher than the currently \nrecommended highest human dose reduced the average number of corpora lutea, implantations and \nviable embryos. No such effects were observed when exposure in animals was at 1.5 times the clinical \nexposure. Effects on fertility in female rats were reversible after a 14-week recovery period. \n \nAdministration of luspatercept to male rats at doses higher than the currently recommended highest \nhuman dose had no adverse effect on male reproductive organs or on their ability to mate and produce \nviable embryos. The highest dose tested in male rats yielded an exposure approximately 7 times the \nclinical exposure. \n \nEmbryo-foetal development (EFD) \nEmbryo-foetal developmental toxicology studies (range-finding and definitive studies) were \nconducted in pregnant rats and rabbits. In the definitive studies, doses of up to 30 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg \nevery week were administered twice during the period of organogenesis. Luspatercept was a selective \ndevelopmental toxicant (dam not affected; foetus affected) in the rat and a maternal and foetal \ndevelopmental toxicant (doe and foetus affected) in the rabbit. Embryofoetal effects were seen in both \nspecies and included reductions in numbers of live foetuses and foetal body weights, increases in \nresorptions, post-implantation loss and skeletal variations and, in rabbit foetuses, malformations of the \nribs and vertebrae. In both species, effects of luspatercept were observed in the EFD studies at the \nlowest dose tested, 5 mg/kg, which corresponds to an estimated exposure in rats and rabbits of \napproximately 2.7 and 5.5 times greater, respectively, than the estimated clinical exposure.  \n \nPre- and post-natal development \nIn a pre- and post-natal development study, with dose levels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg administered once \nevery 2 weeks from gestational day (GD) 6 through post-natal day (PND) 20, adverse findings at all \ndoses consisted of lower F1 pup body weights in both sexes at birth, throughout lactation, and post \nweaning (PND 28); lower body weights during the early premating period (Week 1 and 2) in the F1 \nfemales (adverse only at the 30 mg/kg/dose) and lower body weights in F1 males during the premating, \npairing and post-mating periods; and microscopic kidney findings in F1 pups. Additionally, \nnon-adverse findings included delayed male sexual maturation at the 10 and 30 mg/kg/dose. The delay \nin growth and the adverse kidney findings, in the F1 generation, precluded the determination of a \nNOAEL for F1 general and developmental toxicity. However, there was no effect on behavioural \nindices, fertility or reproductive parameters at any dose level in either sex, therefore the NOAEL for \nbehavioural assessments, fertility and reproductive function in the F1 animals was considered to be the \n30 mg/kg/dose. Luspatercept is transferred through the placenta of pregnant rats and rabbits and is \nexcreted into the milk of lactating rats. \n \nJuvenile toxicity \nIn a study in juvenile rats, luspatercept was administered from postnatal day (PND) 7 to PND 91 at 0, \n1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. Many of the findings seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult rats were repeated \nin the juvenile rats. These findings included glomerulonephritis in the kidney, \nhaemorrhage/congestion, necrosis and mineralization of the adrenal gland, mucosal mineralization in \nthe stomach, lower heart weights, and swollen hindlimbs/feet. Luspatercept-related findings unique to \njuvenile rats included tubular atrophy/hypoplasia of the kidney inner medulla, delays in the mean age \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nof sexual maturation in males, effects on reproductive performance (lower mating indices), and non-\nadverse decreases in bone mineral density in both male and female rats. The effects on reproductive \nperformance were observed after a greater than 3-month recovery period, suggesting a permanent \neffect. Although reversibility of the tubular atrophy/hypoplasia was not examined, these effects are \nalso considered to be irreversible. Adverse effects on the kidney and reproductive system were \nobserved at clinically relevant exposure levels and seen at the lowest dose tested and, thus, an NOAEL \nwas not established. In addition, haematological malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats \nexamined in the highest dose group (10 mg/kg). These findings are all considered potential risks in \npaediatric patients. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nReblozyl 25 mg powder for solution for injection \nReblozyl 75 mg powder for solution for injection \n\nluspatercept \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

What you need to know before you are given Reblozyl \n3. How Reblozyl is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Reblozyl \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Reblozyl is and what it is used for \n \nReblozyl contains the active substance luspatercept. It is used for:  \n \nMyelodysplastic syndromes \nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow \ndisorders.  \n Red blood cells become abnormal and do not develop properly.  \n Patients can get a number of signs and symptoms including a low red blood cell count \n\n(anaemia) and may need red blood cell transfusions. Reblozyl is used in adults with anaemia \ncaused by MDS, who need red blood cell transfusions. It is used in adults who have already had \nor are not able to have erythropoietin therapies. \n\n \nBeta-thalassaemia \nβ-thalassaemia is a blood problem that is passed down through genes.  \n It affects the production of haemoglobin.  \n Patients can get a number of signs and symptoms including a low red blood cell count \n\n(anaemia) and may need red blood cell transfusions. \n \nReblozyl is used in adults with β-thalassaemia who need red blood cell transfusions. \n \nHow Reblozyl works \nReblozyl improves your body’s ability to make red blood cells. Red blood cells contain haemoglobin, \nwhich is a protein that carries oxygen throughout your body. As your body makes more red blood \ncells, your haemoglobin level increases. \n \nHaving Reblozyl reduces the need for red blood cell transfusions. \n Regular blood transfusions can cause abnormally high levels of iron in the blood and in \n\ndifferent organs of the body. This can be harmful over time. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Reblozyl \n \nDo not use Reblozyl \n if you are allergic to luspatercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you are pregnant (see section on Pregnancy) \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before being given this medicine if: \n you are a β-thalassaemia patient and you have had your spleen removed. You may have a higher \n\nrisk of getting a blood clot. Your doctor will talk to you about other possible risk factors that \nmay increase your risk – these include: \no hormone replacement therapy or  \no a previous blood clot  \nYour doctor may use preventive measures or medicines to reduce the chances of you getting a \nblood clot. \n\n you have ever had high blood pressure – this is because Reblozyl may increase it. Your blood \npressure will be checked before you are given Reblozyl and throughout treatment. \n\n \nRoutine tests \nYou will have a blood test before each dose of this medicine. This is because your doctor needs to \nmake sure your haemoglobin level is suitable for you to be given treatment. \n \nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may perform additional tests. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Reblozyl \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy \n Do not use this medicine during pregnancy and for at least 3 months before getting pregnant. \n\nReblozyl may cause harm to your unborn baby. \n Your doctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment. \n If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice \n\nbefore using this medicine. \n \nBreast-feeding \n Do not breast-feed when using this medicine and for 3 months after your last dose. It is not \n\nknown if it passes into the mother’s milk. \n \nContraception \n You should use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Reblozyl and for at \n\nleast 3 months after your last dose. \n \nTalk to your doctor about contraceptive methods that may be right for you while you are using this \nmedicine. \n \nFertility \nIf you are a woman, this medicine may cause fertility problems. This could affect your ability to have \na baby. Talk to your doctor for advice before using it. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel tired, dizzy, or faint, while using Reblozyl. If this happens do not drive or use any tools \nor machines and contact your doctor straight away. \n \nReblozyl contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How Reblozyl is given \n \nBefore you are given this medicine, your doctor will have carried out blood tests and decided you need \nReblozyl. \n \nReblozyl will be given by an injection under your skin (subcutaneously).  \n \nHow much will you be given \nThe dose is based on how much you weigh – in kilograms. The injections will be given by a doctor, \nnurse or other healthcare professional. \n \n The recommended starting dose is 1.0 mg for each kilogram of body weight. \n This dose should be given once every three weeks. \n Your doctor will check your progress and may change your dose if needed. \n \nYour doctor will monitor your blood pressure while you are using Reblozyl. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndromes \nThe maximum single dose is 1.75 mg for each kilogram of body weight. \n \nBeta-thalassaemia \nThe maximum single dose is 1.25 mg for each kilogram of body weight. \n \nIf you miss a dose \nIf you miss an injection of Reblozyl, or an appointment is delayed, you will receive a Reblozyl \ninjection as soon as possible.

There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. \n \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of \nthe administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \nIncompatibilities \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6. \n \nStorage of the product \nUnopened vial \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original carton in order to protect from \nlight. \n \nReconstituted solution \nWhen stored in the original carton, chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted \nmedicinal product has been demonstrated for up to 8 hours at room temperature (≤ 25°C) or for up to \n24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nshould not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. \n \nDo not freeze the reconstituted solution. \n \nDose calculation \nThe total dose, according to the patient’s weight (kg) can be calculated as follow: \n \nTotal dose (mg) = Dose (mg) x patient’s weight (kg) every three weeks. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nReconstitution instructions \nReblozyl is supplied as a lyophilised powder to be reconstituted with water for injections (WFI). A \nsyringe with appropriate graduations must be used for reconstitution to ensure accurate dosage. See \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1. Reblozyl reconstitution table \n\nStrength  Amount of WFI required for \nreconstitution \n\nPost-reconstitution concentration \n(nominal value)\n\n25 mg vial 0.68 mL 50 mg/mL (0.5 mL)\n75 mg vial 1.6 mL 50 mg/mL (1.5 mL)\n\n \n1. Remove the coloured cap from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol wipe.  \n2. Add WFI into the vial by means of a syringe with appropriate graduations with a needle \n\ndirecting the flow onto the lyophilised powder. Allow to stand for one minute. \n3. Discard the needle and syringe used for reconstitution. Do not use them for subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n4. Gently swirl the vial in a circular motion for 30 seconds. Stop swirling and let the vial sit in an \n\nupright position for 30 seconds. \n5. Inspect the vial for undissolved powder in the solution. If undissolved powder is observed, \n\nrepeat step 4 until the powder is completely dissolved. \n6. Invert the vial and gently swirl in an inverted position for 30 seconds. Bring the vial back to the \n\nupright position and let it sit for 30 seconds. \n7. Repeat step 6 seven more times to ensure complete reconstitution of material on the sides of the \n\nvial. \n8. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution prior to administration. When properly mixed, \n\nReblozyl reconstituted solution is a colourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent \nsolution which is free of visible foreign particulate matter. Do not use if undissolved product or \nforeign particulate matter is observed. \n\n9. If the reconstituted solution is not used immediately, see Storage of the product section above. \n \nMethod of administration \nIf the Reblozyl reconstituted solution has been refrigerated, remove from the refrigerator \n15-30 minutes prior to injection to allow it to reach room temperature. This will allow for a more \ncomfortable injection. \n \nThe recommended maximum volume of medicinal product per injection site is 1.2 mL. If more than \n1.2 mL is required, the total volume of Reblozyl should be divided into separate similar volume \ninjections and administered across separate sites. Reconstitute the appropriate number of Reblozyl \nvials to achieve the desired dose. \n \nInject Reblozyl subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. \n \nIf multiple injections are required, use a new syringe and needle for each subcutaneous injection. \nDiscard any unused portion. Do not administer more than one dose from a vial. \n \nDisposal \nDispose of any unused medicinal product or waste material in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
