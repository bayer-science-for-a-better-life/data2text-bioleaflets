This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nAdakveo 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 10 mg crizanlizumab. \n\n \n\nOne vial of 10 ml contains 100 mg crizanlizumab. \n\n \n\nCrizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by \n\nrecombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate) \n\n \n\nColourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid at pH 6 and with an osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAdakveo is indicated for the prevention of recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in sickle cell \n\ndisease patients aged 16 years and older. It can be given as an add-on therapy to \n\nhydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide (HU/HC) or as monotherapy in patients for whom HU/HC is \n\ninappropriate or inadequate. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of sickle cell disease. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of crizanlizumab is 5 mg/kg administered over a period of 30 minutes by \n\nintravenous infusion at week 0, week 2, and every 4 weeks thereafter. \n\n \n\nCrizanlizumab can be given alone or with HU/HC. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the treatment should be administered as soon as possible. \n\n- If crizanlizumab is administered within 2 weeks after the missed dose, dosing should be \ncontinued according to the patient\u2019s original schedule. \n\n- If crizanlizumab is administered more than 2 weeks after the missed dose, dosing should be \ncontinued every 4 weeks thereafter. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nCrizanlizumab has not been studied in elderly patients. No dose adjustment is required as the \n\npharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab in adults are not affected by age. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic (PK) results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with \n\nmild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment \n\nare too limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in patients with hepatic impairment have not been \n\nestablished. Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism (i.e. breakdown \n\ninto peptides and amino acids), and a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with \n\nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in paediatric patients from 6 months to 16 years have not \n\nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nThere is no relevant use of crizanlizumab in infants aged less than 6 months for the indication of \n\nprevention of recurrent vaso-occlusive crises. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nAdakveo should be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 5% \n\nbefore administration. \n\n \n\nThe diluted solution must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic 0.2 micron in-line filter by \n\nintravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes. It must not be administered by intravenous push or \n\nbolus. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nHypersensitivity to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell products. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (defined as occurring within 24 hours) were observed in \n\n2 patients (1.8%) treated with crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg. Patients should be monitored for signs and \n\nsymptoms of infusion-related reactions, which may include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, \n\ndizziness, pruritus, urticaria, sweating, shortness of breath or wheezing. In the event of a severe \n\nreaction, crizanlizumab should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nLaboratory test interference: automated platelet counts \n\n \n\nInterference with automated platelet counts (platelet clumping) has been observed in patients treated \n\nwith crizanlizumab in clinical studies, in particular when tubes containing EDTA \n\n(ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) were used. This may lead to unevaluable or falsely decreased platelet \n\ncounts. There is no evidence that crizanlizumab causes a reduction in circulating platelets or has a \n\npro-aggregant effect in vivo. \n\n \n\nTo mitigate the potential for laboratory test interference, it is recommended to run the test as soon as \n\npossible (within 4 hours of blood collection) or use citrate tubes. When needed, platelet counts can be \n\nestimated via a peripheral blood smear. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInteractions between crizanlizumab and other medicinal products have not been investigated in \n\ndedicated studies. \n\n \n\nMonoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Therefore, \n\nmedicinal products that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 are not expected to affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab. In clinical studies, HU/HC had no effect on crizanlizumab \n\npharmacokinetics in patients. \n\n \n\nNo effect on exposure of co-administered medicinal products is expected based on the metabolic \n\npathways of monoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of Adakveo in pregnant women. Based on data from \n\nanimal studies, crizanlizumab has the potential to cause foetal losses when administered to a pregnant \n\nwoman (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Adakveo \n\nduring pregnancy and in woman of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nTo help determine the effects in pregnant women, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report all \n\npregnancy cases and complications during pregnancy (from 105 days prior to the last menstrual period \n\nonward) to the local representative of the marketing authorisation holder (see package leaflet), in order \n\nto allow monitoring of these patients through the PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring \n\nprogramme (PRIM). In addition, all adverse pregnancy events should be reported via the national \n\nreporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether crizanlizumab is excreted in human milk after administration of Adakveo. \n\nThere are no data on the effects of crizanlizumab on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk \n\nproduction. \n\n \n\nBecause many medicinal products, including antibodies, can be excreted in human milk, a risk to the \n\nnewborn/infant cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Adakveo therapy, \n\ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effect of Adakveo on human fertility. Available non-clinical data do not \n\nsuggest an effect on fertility under crizanlizumab treatment (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAdakveo may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness, fatigue and \n\nsomnolence may occur following administration of crizanlizumab. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (\u226510% of patients) in the Adakveo 5 mg/kg group \n\nwere arthralgia, nausea, back pain, pyrexia and abdominal pain. Severe events were observed for \n\npyrexia and arthralgia (each 0.9%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 1 lists adverse reactions based on pooled data from two studies: the pivotal study, SUSTAIN, \n\nand a single-arm, open-label pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and safety study. Use of \n\ncrizanlizumab in combination with HU/HC did not result in any meaningful differences in the safety \n\nprofile. \n\n \n\nWithin each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent \n\nreactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \n\nseriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on \n\nthe following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions in clinical studies \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Oropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea, abdominal pain* \n\nCommon Diarrhoea, vomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Pruritus* \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\nVery common Arthralgia, back pain \n\nCommon Myalgia, musculoskeletal chest pain \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nVery common Pyrexia \n\nCommon Infusion site reaction* \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \n\ncomplications \n\nCommon Infusion-related reaction \n\n*The following groupings contain the following MedDRA preferred terms: \n\n- Abdominal pain: abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower, abdominal discomfort, \nand abdominal tenderness \n\n- Pruritus: pruritus and vulvovaginal pruritus \n\n- Infusion site reaction: infusion site extravasation, infusion site pain, and infusion site swelling \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nIn clinical studies, treatment-induced anti-crizanlizumab antibodies were transiently detected in \n\n1 patient (0.9%) among the 111 patients who received Adakveo 5 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nThere was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics or of an altered safety profile with \n\nanti-crizanlizumab antibody development. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in patients aged 16 and 17 years are expected to be \n\nthe same as in adults. The safety of crizanlizumab was evaluated in 3 patients aged <18 years. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo cases of overdose have been reported in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nGeneral supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be initiated in cases of suspected \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, ATC code: B06AX01 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCrizanlizumab is a selective IgG2 kappa humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to \n\nP-selectin with high affinity and blocks the interaction with its ligands, including P-selectin \n\nglycoprotein ligand 1. Crizanlizumab can also dissociate preformed P-selectin/PSGL-1 complex. \n\nP-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed on activated endothelial cells and platelets. It plays an \n\nessential role in the initial recruitment of leukocytes and the aggregation of platelets to the site of \n\nvascular injury during inflammation. In the chronic pro-inflammatory state associated with sickle cell \n\ndisease, P-selectin is over-expressed and circulating blood cells and the endothelium are activated and \n\nbecome hyperadhesive. P-selectin-mediated multi-cellular adhesion is a key factor in the pathogenesis \n\nof vaso-occlusion and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Elevated levels of P-selectin are found in patients \n\nwith sickle cell disease. \n\n \n\nBinding P-selectin on the surface of the activated endothelium and platelets has been shown to \n\neffectively block interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, red blood cells and leukocytes, \n\nthereby preventing vaso-occlusion. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nThroughout clinical studies, treatment with crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg resulted in dose-dependent, \n\nimmediate and sustained P-selectin inhibition (as measured ex vivo) in patients with sickle cell disease. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of crizanlizumab, with or without HU/HC, was evaluated in the pivotal study SUSTAIN, \n\na 52-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical study in sickle cell \n\ndisease patients with a history of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). \n\n \n\nIn this study, VOCs were defined as those leading to a healthcare visit, which captured all acute \n\nepisodes of pain with no other cause than a vaso-occlusive event that required a healthcare visit and \n\ntreatment with oral or parenteral opioids or parenteral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n\n(NSAIDs). Acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration and priapism (requiring \n\na healthcare visit), by definition, were also considered VOCs. \n\n \n\nA total of 198 sickle cell disease patients aged 16 to 63 years (inclusive; mean age 30.1\u00b110.3 years), \n\nwith any sickle cell disease genotype (including HbSS [71.2%], HbSC [16.2%], \n\nHbSbeta0-thalassaemia [6.1%], HbSbeta+-thalassaemia [5.1%], and others [1.5%]) and a history of \n\nbetween 2 and 10 VOCs in the previous 12 months (62.6% and 37.4% of the patients had 2-4 or \n\n5-10 VOCs, respectively), were randomised 1:1:1 to Adakveo 5 mg/kg, Adakveo 2.5 mg/kg or \n\nplacebo. The majority of patients were Black or African American (91.9%). Patients received \n\nAdakveo with (62.1%) or without (37.9%) HU/HC. Randomisation was stratified by patients already \n\nreceiving HU/HC (Y/N) and by number of VOCs in the previous 12 months (2 to 4, 5 to 10). Patients \n\nwere allowed to take medicinal products to relieve pain (i.e. paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids) and to \n\nreceive occasional transfusions on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. Patients participating in a chronic transfusion \n\nprogramme (pre-planned series of transfusions for prophylactic purposes) were excluded from the \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\nTreatment with Adakveo 5 mg/kg resulted in a 45.3% lower median annual rate of VOCs compared to \n\nplacebo (Hodges-Lehmann, median absolute difference of -1.01 compared with placebo, 95% CI \n\n[-2.00, 0.00]), which was statistically significant (p=0.010). The median annual rates of uncomplicated \n\nVOCs (any VOCs as defined above, excluding acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic \n\nsequestration or priapism) and days hospitalised were 62.9% and 41.8% lower in the Adakveo \n\n5 mg/kg than in the placebo group, respectively. The VOCs occurring during the study were assessed \n\nby an independent review committee. \n\n \n\nMain efficacy outcomes of the pivotal SUSTAIN study are summarised in Tables 2 and 3. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Results from SUSTAIN clinical study in sickle cell disease \n \n\nEvent Adakveo 5 mg/kg \n\n(N=67) \n(standard median) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=65) \n(standard \n\nmedian) \n\nChange \n\nvs \n\nplacebo \n\nHodges-Lehmann \n\nmedian \n\ndifference \n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n(Wilcoxon \n\nrank sum) \n\nPrimary \n\nendpoint \nAnnual rate of \n\nVOCs \n\n1.63 2.98 -45.3% -1.01 \n\n(-2.00, 0.00) \n\n0.010 \n\nSecondary endpoints  \n\nAnnual rate of \n\ndays hospitalised \n\n4.00 6.87 -41.8% 0.00 \n\n(-4.36, 0.00) \n\n0.450 \n\nAnnual rate of \n\nuncomplicated \n\nVOCs \n\n1.08 2.91 -62.9% -1.00 \n\n(-1.98, 0.00) \n\n- \n\nThe primary (annual rate of VOC leading to healthcare visit) and key secondary (annual rate of days \n\nhospitalised) endpoints were the only ones formally tested for statistical significance according to protocol. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nThe clinical effect demonstrated in the primary efficacy analysis was supported by multiple \n\nsupplementary analyses including a negative binomial regression on investigator assessments with a \n\nconservative method to handle missing data due to early discontinuation of treatment based on \n\noutcomes in the placebo group (RR=0.74, 95% CI=0.52, 1.06). \n\n \n\nIn the Adakveo 5 mg/kg group, clinically significant reductions in the annual rate of VOCs were \n\nobserved across important subgroups (HU/HC use, 2-4 or 5-10 VOCs in the previous 12 months, and \n\nHbSS or non-HbSS genotypes; see Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 3 Annual rate of VOCs in patients - subgroup analyses \n \n\nSubgroup   Adakveo \n\n5 mg/kg \n\n(N=67) \n(standard \n\nmedian) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=65) \n(standard \n\nmedian) \n\nChange vs \n\nplacebo \n\nHodges-Lehmann \n\nmedian difference \n\n(95% CI) \n\nHU/HC use \n\nYes \nn=42 \n\n2.43 \n\nn= 40 \n\n3.58 \n\n-32.1% -1.01 \n\n(-2.44, 0.00) \n\nNo \nn=25 \n\n1.00 \n\nn=25 \n\n2.00 \n\n-50.0% -1.02 \n\n(-2.00, 0.00) \n\nNumber of VOCs \n\nin previous \n\n12 months \n\n2-4 VOCs \nn=42 \n\n1.14 \n\nn=41 \n\n2.00 \n\n-43.0% -0.05 \n\n(-1.56, 0.01) \n\n5-10 VOCs \nn=25 \n\n1.97 \n\nn=24 \n\n5.32 \n\n-63.0% -2.74 \n\n(-5.00, -0.83) \n\nSickle cell \n\ndisease \n\ngenotypes, \n\nincluding HbSC \n\nHbSS \nn=47 \n\n1.97 \n\nn=47 \n\n3.01 \n\n-34.6% -1.01 \n\n(-2.18, 0.00) \n\nNon-HbSS \nn=20 \n\n0.99 \n\nn=18 \n\n2.00 \n\n-50.5% -1.01 \n\n(-2.01, 0.00) \n\n \n\nA greater than two-fold increase in the proportion of patients with no VOC and who completed the \n\nstudy was observed in the Adakveo 5 mg/kg group compared to placebo (22% vs 8%; odds ratio [95% \n\nCI]: 3.57 [1.20, 10.63]). A similar difference was also observed across important subgroups (HU/HC \n\nuse, genotype). \n\n \n\nTreatment with Adakveo 5 mg/kg was also associated with a three-fold longer Kaplan-Meier \n\nestimated median time to first VOC compared with placebo (4.07 vs 1.38 months; HR=0.495, 95% CI: \n\n0.331, 0.741) (Figure 1) and a two-fold longer median time from randomisation to second VOC \n\ncompared to placebo (10.32 vs 5.09 months; HR=0.534, 95% CI: 0.329, 0.866). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curve of time to first VOC \n \n\n                                 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of crizanlizumab in patients aged 16 and 17 years is expected to be the same as in adults. \n\nThree patients (2.7%) aged less than 18 years were treated with crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg in clinical \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nAdakveo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of sickle cell disease (see \n\nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nConditional approval \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u201cconditional approval\u201d scheme. This \n\nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \n\nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe median time to reach maximum serum concentration of crizanlizumab (Tmax) was 1.92 hours at \n\nsteady state following intravenous administration of 5 mg/kg over a period of 30 minutes in sickle cell \n\ndisease patients. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nCrizanlizumab distribution is typical of endogenous human antibodies within the vascular and \n\nextracellular spaces. The volume of distribution (Vz) was 4.26 litres after a single 5 mg/kg intravenous \n\ninfusion of crizanlizumab in healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nAntibodies are primarily eliminated via proteolysis by lysosomal enzymes in the liver to small \n\npeptides and amino acids. \n\nAdakveo 5 mg/kg  \n\nPlacebo \n\nNumber of patients at risk \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\nili\n\nty\n o\n\nf \nb\ne\nin\n\ng\n f\nre\n\ne\n f\n\nro\nm\n\n f\nir\ns\nt \n\nV\nO\n\nC\n (\n\n%\n) \n\n67 49 41 35 30 26 24 20 18 17 16 15 7 \n\n65 37 23 21 17 13 12 9 8 6 5 4 1 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\nTime (months) \n\n100 \n\n90 \n\n80 \n\n70 \n\n60 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \n\nAdakveo 5 mg/kg  \n\nPlacebo \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nIn healthy volunteers, the mean terminal elimination half-life (T\u00bd) was 10.6 days and the mean \n\nclearance was 11.7 ml/h at crizanlizumab dose level 5 mg/kg. In patients with sickle cell disease, the \n\nmean elimination T\u00bd during the dosing interval was 7.5 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe exposure to crizanlizumab (mean Cmax, AUClast, or AUCinf) increased in non-linear manner over \n\nthe dose range of 0.2 to 8 mg/kg in healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a population PK analysis in patients with eGFR ranging from 35 to 202 ml/min/1.73 m2, no \n\nclinically important differences in the pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab were found between patients \n\nwith mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Data from patients \n\nwith severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in patients with hepatic impairment have not been \n\nestablished. Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism (i.e. breakdown \n\ninto peptides and amino acids), and a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetics in paediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been investigated. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, tissue cross-reactivity and repeated dose toxicity. \n\n \n\nIn the 26-week repeated dose toxicity study, administration of crizanlizumab in cynomolgus monkeys \n\nat dose levels up to 50 mg/kg/dose once every 4 weeks (at least 13.5 times the human clinical \n\nexposure based on AUC in patients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg once every four weeks) was \n\ngenerally well tolerated. There were no primary crizanlizumab-related findings on any endpoint \n\nevaluated. At 50 mg/kg, minimal to moderate inflammation of the vessels in multiple tissues \n\nconsidered to be an antigen-antibody complex reaction (primate antihuman antibody) was observed in \n\n2 of 10 animals. There was one death attributed to aspiration of gastric contents following a \n\nperi-infusional reaction mediated by anti-drug-antibody-dependent hypersensitivity. \n\n \n\nPharmacological effects of crizanlizumab on haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters in \n\nthe cynomolgus monkey were evaluated in the 26-week repeated dose toxicology study. Respiratory \n\nrate and neurological parameters were also assessed. There were no crizanlizumab-related effects on \n\narterial blood pressure or on heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, QT, and heart rate corrected QT (QTc) intervals \n\non the electrocardiograms (ECG). No rhythm abnormalities or qualitative changes were observed \n\nduring the qualitative ECG assessment. There were no crizanlizumab-related effects on respiration rate \n\nor any neurological parameter evaluated. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted with \n\ncrizanlizumab. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nIn a 26-week repeated dose toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys were administered crizanlizumab \n\nonce every 4 weeks at doses up to 50 mg/kg (at least 13.5 times the human clinical exposure based on \n\nAUC in patients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg once every four weeks). There were no adverse \n\neffects of crizanlizumab on male and female reproductive organs. \n\n \n\nIn an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys, pregnant animals \n\nreceived intravenous crizanlizumab once every two weeks during the period of organogenesis, at doses \n\nof 10 and 50 mg/kg (approximately 2.8 and 16 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in \n\npatients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg/dose once every four weeks, respectively). No maternal \n\ntoxicity was observed. There was an increase in foetal loss (abortions or stillbirths) at both doses and \n\nthis was higher in the third trimester. The cause of the foetal losses in monkeys is unknown but may be \n\ndue to the development of anti-drug antibodies against crizanlizumab. There were no effects on infant \n\ngrowth and development during the 6 months postpartum that were attributable to crizanlizumab. \n\n \n\nMeasurable crizanlizumab serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at postnatal \n\nday 28, confirming that crizanlizumab, like other IgG antibodies, crosses the placental barrier. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

If \n\nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \n\nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, including 4.5 hours at room \n\ntemperature (up to 25\u00b0C) from the start of preparation to completion of the infusion, unless dilution \n\nhas taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n\n10 ml concentrate for solution for infusion in a type I glass vial with a coated chlorobutyl rubber \n\nstopper sealed with an aluminium cap with a plastic flip-off disk containing 100 mg crizanlizumab. \n\n \n\nPack of 1 vial. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n\nAdakveo vials are for single use only. \n\n \n\nPreparing the infusion \n\n \n\nThe diluted solution for infusion should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic \n\ntechniques. \n\n \n\nThe total dose and required volume of Adakveo depend on the patient\u2019s body weight; 5 mg of \n\ncrizanlizumab is administered per kg body weight. \n\n \n\nThe volume to be used for the preparation of the infusion is calculated according to the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\nVolume (ml) = \nPatient\u2019s body weight (kg) x prescribed dose [5 mg/kg] \n\nConcentration of Adakveo [10 mg/ml] \n\n \n\n1. Obtain the number of vials required to deliver the prescribed dose and bring them to room \n\ntemperature (for a maximum of 4 hours). One vial is needed for every 10 ml of Adakveo (see \n\nbelow table). \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\n(kg) \n\nDose (mg) Volume (ml) Vials (n) \n\n40 200 20 2 \n\n60 300 30 3 \n\n80 400 40 4 \n\n100 500 50 5 \n\n120 600 60 6 \n\n \n\n2. Visually inspect the vials. \n\n- The solution in the vials should be clear to opalescent. Do not use if particles are present \nin the solution. \n\n- The solution should be colourless or may have a slight brownish-yellow tint. \n \n\n3. Withdraw a volume equal to the required volume of Adakveo from a 100 ml infusion bag \n\ncontaining either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 5% and \n\ndiscard. \n\n- No incompatibilities between the diluted Adakveo solution and infusion bags composed \n\nof polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) have been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n4. Withdraw the necessary volume of Adakveo from the vials and inject slowly into the previously \n\nprepared infusion bag. \n\n- The solution must not be mixed or co-administered with other medicinal products through \n\nthe same intravenous line. \n\n- Keep the volume of Adakveo added to the infusion bag in the range of 10 ml to 96 ml to \n\nobtain a final concentration in the infusion bag within 1 mg/ml to 9.6 mg/ml. \n\n \n\n5. Mix the diluted solution by gently inverting the infusion bag. DO NOT SHAKE. \n\n \n\nAdministration \n\n \n\nAdakveo diluted solution must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic 0.2 micron in-line \n\nfilter by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes. No incompatibilities have been observed \n\nbetween Adakveo and infusion sets composed of PVC, PE-lined PVC, polyurethane, and in-line filter \n\nmembranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES), polyamide (PA) or polysulphone (PSU). \n\n \n\nAfter administration of Adakveo, flush the line with at least 25 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection or dextrose 5%. \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nAdakveo 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \ncrizanlizumab \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Adakveo is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Adakveo \n\n3. How Adakveo is given \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Adakveo \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Adakveo is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat Adakveo is \nAdakveo contains the active substance crizanlizumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs). \n\n \n\nWhat Adakveo is used for \nAdakveo is used to prevent recurrent painful crises occurring in patients aged 16 years and over with \n\nsickle cell disease. Adakveo can be given in combination with hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, \n\nalthough it may also be used alone. \n\n \n\nSickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. It causes affected red blood cells to become \n\nsickle-shaped and have difficulty passing through small blood vessels. Additionally in sickle cell \n\ndisease the blood vessels are damaged and sticky due to ongoing chronic inflammation. This leads to \n\nblood cells sticking to the blood vessels, causing acute episodes of pain and organ damage. \n\n \n\nHow Adakveo works \nPatients with sickle cell disease have higher levels of a protein called P-selectin. Adakveo binds \n\nP-selectin. This should stop blood cells sticking to the vessel walls and help prevent painful crises. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Adakveo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \n\nyou, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Adakveo \n \n\nYou must not be given Adakveo: \n- if you are allergic to crizanlizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \n\nInfusion reactions \nMedicines of this type (called monoclonal antibodies) are administered into a vein (intravenously) as \n\nan infusion. They can cause unwanted reactions (side effects) when they are infused into your body. \n\nSuch reactions may happen within 24 hours of receiving an infusion. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following, which may be signs \n\nof an infusion reaction: \n\n- Fever, chills, shivering, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, dizziness, pain where the infusion needle is \ninserted, blisters, itching, shortness of breath or wheezing. See also section 4, \u201cPossible side \n\neffects\u201d. \n\nYour doctor or nurse may monitor you for signs and symptoms of such infusion reactions. \n\n \n\nBlood tests during Adakveo treatment \nIf you need to have any blood tests, tell the doctor or nurse that you are on treatment with Adakveo. \n\nThis is important because this treatment may interfere with a laboratory test used to measure the \n\nnumber of platelets in your blood. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nAdakveo should not be used in children or adolescents below 16 years of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Adakveo \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAdakveo has not been tested in pregnant women therefore there is limited information about its safety \n\nin pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant, or are a woman who could become pregnant and is not using contraception, it is \n\nnot recommended to use Adakveo. \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether Adakveo or its individual ingredients pass into breast milk. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential \n\nrisk(s) of Adakveo during pregnancy or breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nAdakveo could have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. If you experience \n\ntiredness, drowsiness or dizziness, do not drive or use machines until you feel better. \n\n \n\nAdakveo contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n3. How Adakveo is given \n \n\nAdakveo will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Adakveo is given, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the \n\ninfusion. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you when you will have your infusions and follow-up appointments. \n\n \n\nHow much Adakveo you will be given \nThe recommended dose is 5 mg per kilogram of body weight. You will be given the first infusion at \n\nWeek 0 and the second infusion two weeks later (Week 2). After that you will be given an infusion \n\nevery 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nHow the infusion is given \nAdakveo is administered into a vein (intravenously) as an infusion lasting 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nAdakveo can be given alone or with hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide. \n\n \n\nHow long Adakveo treatment lasts \nYou should discuss with your doctor how long you will need to receive treatment. Your doctor will \n\nregularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. \n\n \n\nIf you forget a Adakveo infusion \nIt is very important that you receive all your infusions. If you miss an appointment for an infusion, \n\ncontact your doctor as soon as possible to reschedule. \n\n \n\nIf you stop Adakveo treatment \nDo not stop Adakveo treatment unless your doctor tells you that you can. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSome side effects could be serious \nTell the doctor or nurse giving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of the following: \n\n- Fever, chills, shivering, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, dizziness, pain where the infusion needle is \ninserted, blisters, itching, shortness of breath or wheezing. \n\nThese symptoms can be signs of infusion reaction, which is a common side effect (this means it may \n\naffect up to 1 in every 10 people). \n\n \n\nOther possible side effects \nOther possible side effects include those listed below. If these side effects become severe, tell your \n\ndoctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- pain in the joints (arthralgia) \n- nausea \n- back pain \n- fever \n- pain in the lower or upper abdomen, feeling of tenderness in the abdomen and abdominal \n\ndiscomfort \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in every 10 people) \n- diarrhoea \n- itching (including vulvovaginal itching) \n- vomiting \n- muscle pain (myalgia) \n- pain in the muscles or bones of the chest (musculoskeletal chest pain) \n- sore throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n- redness or swelling and pain at the site of the infusion \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

This means that there is more evidence to come \n\nabout this medicine. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year and \n\nthis leaflet will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\nOther sources of information \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \n\nAdakveo vials are for single use only. \n\n \n\nPreparing the infusion \n\n \n\nThe diluted solution for infusion  should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic \n\ntechniques. \n\n \n\nThe total dose and required volume of Adakveo depend on the patient\u2019s body weight; 5 mg of \n\ncrizanlizumab is administered per kg body weight. \n\n \n\nThe volume to be used for the preparation of the infusion is calculated according to the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\nVolume (ml) = \nPatient\u2019s body weight (kg) x prescribed dose [5 mg/kg] \n\nConcentration of Adakveo [10 mg/ml] \n\n \n\n1. Obtain the number of vials required to deliver the prescribed dose and bring them to room \n\ntemperature (for a maximum of 4 hours). One vial is needed for every 10 ml of Adakveo (see \n\nbelow table). \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\n(kg) \n\nDose (mg) Volume (ml) Vials (n) \n\n40 200 20 2 \n\n60 300 30 3 \n\n80 400 40 4 \n\n100 500 50 5 \n\n120 600 60 6 \n\n \n\n2. Visually inspect the vials. \n\n- The solution in the vials should be clear to opalescent. Do not use if particles are present \nin the solution. \n\n- The solution should be colourless or may have a slight brownish-yellow tint. \n \n\n3. Withdraw a volume equal to the required volume of Adakveo from a 100 ml infusion bag \n\ncontaining either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 5% and \n\ndiscard. \n\n- No incompatibilities between the diluted Adakveo solution and infusion bags composed \n\nof polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) have been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n4. Withdraw the necessary volume of Adakveo from the vials and inject slowly into the previously \n\nprepared infusion bag. \n\n- The solution must not be mixed or co-administered with other medicinal products through \n\nthe same intravenous line. \n\n- Keep the volume of Adakveo added to the infusion bag in the range of 10 ml to 96 ml to \n\nobtain a final concentration in the infusion bag within 1 mg/ml to 9.6 mg/ml. \n \n\n5. Mix the diluted solution by gently inverting the infusion bag. DO NOT SHAKE. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nStorage of the diluted solution \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability, from the start of preparation of the diluted solution for infusion \n\nuntil end of infusion, has been demonstrated for up to 8 hours at room temperature (up to 25\u00b0C) and at \n\n2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 24 hours overall. \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used immediately. If \n\nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \n\nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, including 4.5 hours at room \n\ntemperature (up to 25\u00b0C) from the start of preparation to completion of the infusion, unless dilution \n\nhas taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\nAdministration \n\n \n\nAdakveo diluted solution must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic 0.2 micron in-line \n\nfilter by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes. No incompatibilities have been observed \n\nbetween Adakveo and infusion sets composed of PVC, PE-lined PVC, polyurethane, and in-line filter \n\nmembranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES), polyamide (PA) or polysulphone (PSU). \n\n \n\nAfter administration of Adakveo, flush the line with at least 25 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection or dextrose 5%. \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX IV \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS ON THE GRANTING OF THE CONDITIONAL MARKETING \n\nAUTHORISATION PRESENTED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Conditional marketing authorisation \n \n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \n\nfavourable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as further explained \n\nin the European Public Assessment Report. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

adakveo is used to prevent recurrent painful crises occurring in patients aged 16 years and over with sickle cell disease. adakveo can be given in combination with hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, although it may also be used alone. sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. it causes affected red blood cells to become sickle-shaped and have difficulty passing through small blood vessels. additionally in sickle cell disease the blood vessels are damaged and sticky due to ongoing chronic inflammation. this leads to blood cells sticking to the blood vessels, causing acute episodes of pain and organ damage. how adakveo works patients with sickle cell disease have higher levels of a protein called p-selectin. adakveo binds p-selectin. this should stop blood cells sticking to the vessel walls and help prevent painful crises. if you have any questions about how adakveo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor or nurse.",
