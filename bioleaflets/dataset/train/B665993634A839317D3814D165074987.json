NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEylea 40 mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml solution for injection contains 40 mg aflibercept*. \n \nOne pre-filled syringe contains 90 microlitres, equivalent to 3.6 mg aflibercept. This provides a usable \namount to deliver a single dose of 50 microlitres containing 2 mg aflibercept. \n \n*Fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) \nreceptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and produced in \nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nThe solution is a clear, colourless to pale yellow and iso-osmotic solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of  \n\n\u2022 neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), \n\u2022 visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or \n\ncentral RVO) (see section 5.1), \n\u2022 visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1), \n\u2022 visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) (see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEylea is for intravitreal injection only. \n \nEylea must only be administered by a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal \ninjections. \n \nPosology \n \nwet AMD \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 50 microlitres. \n \nEylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses. The treatment \ninterval is then extended to two months. \n \nBased on the physician\u2019s judgement of visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be \nmaintained at two months or further extended using a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where \ninjection intervals are increased in 2- or 4-weekly increments to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic \n\n\n\n  \n3 \n\n \n\noutcomes. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened \naccordingly to a minimum of two months during the first 12 months of treatment. \n \nThere is no requirement for monitoring between injections. Based on the physician\u2019s judgement the \nschedule of monitoring visits may be more frequent than the injection visits. \nTreatment intervals greater than four months between injections have not been studied (see Section \n5.1). \n \nMacular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.   \nAfter the initial injection, treatment is given monthly. The interval between two doses should not be \nshorter than one month. \n \nIf visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, \nEylea should be discontinued. \n \nMonthly treatment continues until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there are no signs of \ndisease activity. Three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. \n \nTreatment may then be continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with gradually increased treatment \nintervals to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes, however there are insufficient data to \nconclude on the length of these intervals. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment \ninterval should be shortened accordingly. \n \nThe monitoring and treatment schedule should be determined by the treating physician based on the \nindividual patient\u2019s response.  \n \nMonitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging \ntechniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). \n \nDiabetic macular oedema \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.  \n \nEylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for five consecutive doses, followed by one \ninjection every two months. There is no requirement for monitoring between injections.  \n \nAfter the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, and based on visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the \ntreatment interval may be extended, such as with a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where the \ntreatment intervals are gradually increased to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes; \nhowever there are insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If visual and/or \nanatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. \n \nThe schedule for monitoring should therefore be determined by the treating physician and may be \nmore frequent than the schedule of injections. \n \nIf visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, \nEylea should be discontinued. \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to \n50 microlitres.  \n \n\n\n\n  \n4 \n\n \n\nAdditional doses may be administered if visual and/or anatomic outcomes indicate that the disease \npersists. Recurrences should be treated as a new manifestation of the disease. \n \nThe schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. \n \nThe interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic and/or renal impairment \nNo specific studies in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. \n \nAvailable data do not suggest a need for a dose adjustment with Eylea in these patients (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo special considerations are needed. There is limited experience in patients older than 75 years with \nDME. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea have not been established in children and adolescents. There is no \nrelevant use of Eylea in the paediatric population for the indications of wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, \nDME and myopic CNV. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravitreal injections must be carried out according to medical standards and applicable guidelines by \na qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal injections. In general, adequate \nanaesthesia and asepsis, including topical broad spectrum microbicide (e.g. povidone iodine applied to \nthe periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface), have to be ensured. Surgical hand disinfection, sterile \ngloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) are recommended. \n \nThe injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, \navoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of \n0.05 ml is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. \n \nImmediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in \nintraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve \nhead or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. \n \nFollowing intravitreal injection patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of \nendophthalmitis (e.g. eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. \n \nEach pre-filled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. Extraction of multiple \ndoses from a pre-filled syringe may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. \n \nThe pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept. The extractable \nvolume of the syringe (90 microlitres) is not to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled \nbefore injecting. \n \nInjecting the entire volume of the prefilled syringe could result in overdose. To expel the air bubble \nalong with excess medicinal product, slowly depress the plunger to align the cylindrical base of the \ndome plunger with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 50 microlitres i.e. 2 mg \naflibercept). \n \nAfter injection any unused product must be discarded. \n\n\n\n  \n5 \n\n \n\n \nFor handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance aflibercept or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nActive or suspected ocular or periocular infection. \nActive severe intraocular inflammation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravitreal injection-related reactions  \nIntravitreal injections, including those with Eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis, \nintraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic \ncataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering \nEylea. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit \nearly treatment if an infection occurs. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive \nof endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events without delay.  \n \nIncreases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including \nthose with Eylea (see section 4.8). Special precaution is needed in patients with poorly controlled \nglaucoma (do not inject Eylea while the intraocular pressure is \u2265 30 mmHg). In all cases, both the \nintraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must therefore be monitored and \nmanaged appropriately. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation, e.g. pain, \nphotophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity. \n \nSystemic effects \nSystemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have \nbeen reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that \nthese may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients with \nCRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or \nmyocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Caution should be exercised when treating such \npatients. \n \nOther \nAs with other intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV \nthe following also applies: \n\n \n\u2022 The safety and efficacy of Eylea therapy administered to both eyes concurrently have not been \n\nsystematically studied (see section 5.1). If bilateral treatment is performed at the same time this \ncould lead to an increased systemic exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse \nevents. \n\n\u2022 Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) \nThere is no data available on the concomitant use of Eylea with other anti-VEGF medicinal \nproducts (systemic or ocular). \n\n\u2022 Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-\nVEGF therapy for wet AMD, include a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. \nWhen initiating Eylea therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for \nretinal pigment epithelial tears. \n\n\u2022 Treatment should be withheld in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or \n4 macular holes. \n\n\n\n  \n6 \n\n \n\n\u2022 In the event of a retinal break the dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed \nuntil the break is adequately repaired. \n\n\u2022 The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next \nscheduled treatment in the event of: \n\no a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of \u226530 letters compared with the \nlast assessment of visual acuity; \n\no a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the \nhaemorrhage is \u226550%, of the total lesion area. \n\n\u2022 The dose should be withheld within the previous or next 28 days in the event of a performed or \nplanned intraocular surgery. \n\n\u2022 Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk \nto the foetus (see section 4.6). \n\n\u2022 Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \nleast 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.6). \n\n\u2022 There is limited experience with treatment of patients with ischaemic CRVO and BRVO. In \npatients presenting with clinical signs of irreversible ischaemic visual function loss, the \ntreatment is not recommended. \n\n \nPopulations with limited data \nThere is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes or in \ndiabetic patients with an HbA1c over 12% or with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \nEylea has not been studied in patients with active systemic infections or in patients with concurrent \neye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no experience of treatment \nwith Eylea in diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be \nconsidered by the physician when treating such patients.  \n \nIn myopic CNV there is no experience with Eylea in the treatment of non-Asian patients, patients who \nhave previously undergone treatment for myopic CNV, and patients with extrafoveal lesions.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nAdjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Eylea has not been studied, therefore, \na safety profile is not established. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least \n3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.4). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nAlthough the systemic exposure after ocular administration is very low, Eylea should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether aflibercept is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nEylea is not recommended during breast-feeding. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to abstain from Eylea therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n\n\n  \n7 \n\n \n\n \nFertility \nResults from animal studies with high systemic exposure indicate that aflibercept can impair male and \nfemale fertility (see section 5.3). Such effects are not expected after ocular administration with very \nlow systemic exposure. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nInjection with Eylea has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to possible \ntemporary visual disturbances associated either with the injection or the eye examination. Patients \nshould not drive or use machines until their visual function has recovered sufficiently. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nA total of 3,102 patients constituted the safety population in the eight phase III studies. Among those, \n2,501 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. \n \nSerious ocular adverse reactions in the study eye related to the injection procedure have occurred in \nless than 1 in 1,900 intravitreal injections with Eylea and included blindness, endophthalmitis, retinal \ndetachment, cataract traumatic, cataract, vitreous haemorrhage, vitreous detachment, and intraocular \npressure increased (see section 4.4). \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients treated with Eylea) were \nconjunctival haemorrhage (25%), visual acuity reduced (11%), eye pain (10%), cataract (8%), \nintraocular pressure increased (8%), vitreous detachment (7%), and vitreous floaters (7%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety data described below include all adverse reactions from the eight phase III studies in the \nindications wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV with a reasonable possibility of \ncausality to the injection procedure or medicinal product. \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency using the following convention: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n\n\n\n  \n8 \n\n \n\n \nTable 1:  All treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions reported in patients in phase III studies \n(pooled data of the phase III studies for the indications wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic \nCNV) or during post-marketing surveillance \n \nSystem \nOrgan \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity***   \n\nEye \ndisorders \n\nVisual acuity \nreduced, \nConjunctival \nhaemorrhage, \nEye pain \n\nRetinal pigment epithelial tear*, \nDetachment of the retinal \npigment epithelium, \nRetinal degeneration, \nVitreous haemorrhage, \nCataract, \nCataract cortical, \nCataract nuclear, \nCataract subcapsular, \nCorneal erosion,  \nCorneal abrasion, \nIntraocular pressure increased, \nVision blurred, \nVitreous floaters, \nVitreous detachment, \nInjection site pain, \nForeign body sensation in eyes, \nLacrimation increased, \nEyelid oedema, \nInjection site haemorrhage, \nPunctate keratitis, \nConjunctival hyperaemia, \nOcular hyperaemia \n\nEndophthalmitis**, \nRetinal detachment, \nRetinal tear,  \nIritis, \nUveitis, \nIridocyclitis, \nLenticular opacities, \nCorneal epithelium \ndefect, \nInjection site \nirritation, \nAbnormal sensation \nin eye, \nEyelid irritation, \nAnterior chamber \nflare,  \nCorneal oedema \n\nBlindness, \nCataract \ntraumatic, \nVitritis, \nHypopyon \n\n* Conditions known to be associated with wet AMD. Observed in the wet AMD studies only. \n** Culture positive and culture negative endophthalmitis \n*** During the post-marketing period, reports of hypersensitivity included rash, pruritus, urticaria, and isolated \n\ncases of severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn the wet AMD phase III studies, there was an increased incidence of conjunctival haemorrhage in \npatients receiving anti-thrombotic agents. This increased incidence was comparable between patients \ntreated with ranibizumab and Eylea. \n \nArterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are adverse events potentially related to systemic VEGF \ninhibition. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and \nmyocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. \n\nA low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the Eylea clinical trials in \npatients with AMD, DME, RVO and myopic CNV. Across indications no notable difference between \nthe groups treated with aflibercept and the respective comparator groups were observed. \n\n\n\n  \n9 \n\n \n\n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials, doses of up to 4 mg in monthly intervals have been used and isolated cases of \noverdoses with 8 mg occurred. \n \nOverdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case of \noverdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by the treating physician, \nadequate treatment should be initiated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals / Antineovascularisation agents \nATC code: S01LA05 \n \nAflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2 \nextracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. \n \nAflibercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nAflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than \ntheir natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF \nreceptors.  \n \nMechanism of action \nVascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of \nthe VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular \npermeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR-1 and \nVEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also \npresent on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in \npathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF can synergize with VEGF-\nA in these processes, and is also known to promote leucocyte infiltration and vascular inflammation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nwet AMD \n \nWet AMD is characterised by pathological choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Leakage of blood and \nfluid from CNV may cause retinal thickening or oedema and/or sub-/intra-retinal haemorrhage, \nresulting in loss of visual acuity. \n \nIn patients treated with Eylea (one injection per month for three consecutive months, followed by one \ninjection every 2 months), central retinal thickness [CRT] decreased soon after treatment initiation, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n  \n10 \n\n \n\nand the mean CNV lesion size was reduced, consistent with the results seen with ranibizumab 0.5 mg \nevery month. \n \nIn the VIEW1 study there were mean decreases in CRT on optical coherence tomography (OCT) (-130 \nand -129 microns at week 52 for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and ranibizumab 0.5 mg every \nmonth study groups, respectively). Also at the 52 week time point, in the VIEW2 study there were \nmean decreases in CRT on OCT (-149 and -139 microns for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and \nranibizumab 0.5 mg every month study groups, respectively). The reduction of CNV size and \nreduction in CRT were generally maintained in the second year of the studies. \n \nThe ALTAIR study was conducted in Japanese patients with treatment na\u00efve wet AMD, showing \nsimilar outcomes to the VIEW studies using 3 initial monthly Eylea 2 mg injections, followed by one \ninjection after a further 2 months, and then continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with variable \ntreatment intervals (2- week or 4- week adjustments) up to a maximum 16 week interval according to \npre-specified criteria. At week 52, there were mean decreases in central retinal thickness (CRT) on \nOCT of -134.4 and \u2013126.1 microns for the 2-week adjustment group and the 4-week adjustment group, \nrespectively. The proportion of patients without fluid on OCT at week 52 was 68.3% and 69.1% in the \n2- and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively. The reduction in CRT was generally maintained in \nboth treatment arms in the second year of the ALTAIR study. \n \nMacular oedema secondary to CRVO and BRVO \n \nIn CRVO and BRVO, retinal ischaemia occurs and signals the release of VEGF which in turn \ndestabilises the tight junctions, and promotes endothelial cell proliferation. Up-regulation of VEGF is \nassociated with the breakdown of the blood retina barrier, increased vascular permeability, retinal \noedema, and neovascularisation complications. \n \nIn patients treated with 6 consecutive monthly injections of Eylea 2mg, there was a consistent, rapid \nand robust morphologic response (as measured by improvements in mean CRT) observed. At week 24, \nthe reduction in CRT was statistically superior versus control in all three studies (COPERNICUS in \nCRVO: -457 vs. -145 microns; GALILEO in CRVO: -449 vs. -169 microns; VIBRANT in BRVO: -\n280 vs. -128 microns). This decrease from baseline in CRT was maintained to the end of each study, \nweek 100 in COPERNICUS, week 76 in GALILEO, and week 52 in VIBRANT. \n \nDiabetic macular oedema \n \nDiabetic macular oedema is a consequence of diabetic retinopathy and is characterised by increased \nvasopermeability and damage to the retinal capillaries which may result in loss of visual acuity.  \n \nIn patients treated with Eylea, the majority of whom were classified as having Type II diabetes, a rapid \nand robust response in morphology (CRT, DRSS level) was observed.  \n \nIn the VIVIDDME and the VISTADME studies, a statistically significant greater mean decrease in CRT \nfrom baseline to week 52 was observed in patients treated with Eylea than with the laser control, -\n192.4 and -183.1 microns for the 2Q8 Eylea groups and -66.2 and -73.3 microns for the control \ngroups, respectively. At week 100 the decrease was maintained with -195.8 and -191.1 microns for the \n2Q8 Eylea groups and -85.7 and -83.9 microns for the control groups, in the VIVIDDME and \nVISTADME studies, respectively. \n \nA \u2265 2 step improvement in DRSS was assessed in a pre-specified manner in VIVIDDME and \nVISTADME. The DRSS score was gradable in 73.7% of the patients in VIVIDDME and 98.3% of the \npatients in VISTADME. At week 52, 27.7% and 29.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups, and 7.5% and 14.3% \nof the control groups experienced a \u22652 step improvement in the DRSS. At week 100, the respective \npercentages were 32.6% and 37.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups and 8.2% and 15.6% of the control \ngroups. \n \n\n\n\n  \n11 \n\n \n\nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation  \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) is a frequent cause of vision loss in adults with \npathologic myopia. It develops as a wound healing mechanism consequent to Bruch\u2019s membrane \nruptures and represents the most vision-threatening event in pathologic myopia.  \n \nIn patients treated with Eylea in the MYRROR study (one injection given at start of therapy, with \nadditional injections given in case of disease persistence or recurrence), CRT decreased soon after \ntreatment initiation favouring Eylea at week 24 (-79 microns and -4 microns for the Eylea 2 mg \ntreatment group and the control group, respectively), which was maintained through week 48. In \naddition, the mean CNV lesion size decreased.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nwet AMD \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, \nactive-controlled studies in patients with wet AMD (VIEW1 and VIEW2) with a total of \n2,412 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (1,817 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 49 to \n99 years with a mean of 76 years. In these clinical studies, approximately 89% (1,616/1,817) of the \npatients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately \n63% (1,139/1,817) were 75 years of age or older. In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a \n1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: \n \n1) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (Eylea 2Q8); \n2) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); \n3) Eylea administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 0.5Q4); and \n4) ranibizumab administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5Q4). \n \nIn the second year of the studies, patients continued to receive the initially randomised dosage but on a \nmodified dosing schedule guided by assessment of visual and anatomic outcomes with a protocol-\ndefined maximum dosing interval of 12 weeks. \n \nIn both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in the Per Protocol Set \nwho maintained vision, i.e. losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 from baseline. \n \nIn the VIEW1 study, at week 52, 95.1% of patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision \ncompared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. In the VIEW2 study, at week 52, 95.6% \nof patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision compared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab \n0.5Q4 group. In both studies Eylea was shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to the \nranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. \n \nDetailed results from the combined analysis of both studies are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 below. \n \n\n\n\n  \n12 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Efficacy outcomes at week 52 (primary analysis) and week 96; combined data from the \nVIEW1 and VIEW2 studiesB) \n \nEfficacy Outcome Eylea 2Q8 E) \n\n(Eylea 2 mg every 8 weeks \nfollowing 3 initial monthly \n\ndoses) \n(N = 607) \n\nRanibizumab 0.5Q4 \n(ranibizumab 0.5 mg every \n\n4 weeks) \n \n\n(N = 595) \nWeek 52 Week 96 Week 52 Week 96 \n\nMean number of injections \nfrom baseline  7.6 11.2 12.3 16.5 \n\nMean number of injections \nfrom Week 52 to 96  4.2  4.7 \n\nProportion of patients with  \n< 15 letters loss from \nbaseline ( PPS A)) \n\n95.33%B) 92.42% 94.42% B) 91.60% \n\n DifferenceC) \n(95% CI)D) \n\n0.9% \n(-1.7, 3.5)F) \n\n0.8% \n(-2.3, 3.8)F)   \n\nMean change in BCVA as \nmeasured by ETDRSA) \nletter score from baseline  \n\n8.40 7.62 8.74 7.89 \n\nDifference in LS A)           \nmean change (ETDRS \nletters)C) \n(95% CI)D) \n\n-0.32 \n(-1.87, 1.23) \n\n-0.25 \n(-1.98, 1.49)   \n\nProportion of patients with \n\u2265 15 letters gain from \nbaseline \n\n30.97% 33.44% 32.44% 31.60% \n\nDifferenceC) \n(95% CI)D) \n\n-1.5% \n(-6.8, 3.8) \n\n1.8% \n(-3.5, 7.1)   \n\n \n\nA)  BCVA: Best Corrected Visual Acuity \n ETDRS: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study \n LS: Least square means derived from ANCOVA \n PPS: Per Protocol Set \nB)  Full Analysis Set (FAS), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) for all analyses except proportion of \n\npatients with maintained visual acuity at week 52 which is PPS \nC)  The difference is the value of the Eylea group minus the value of the ranibizumab group.

Mean Change in Visual Acuity \nfrom Baseline to Week 96 for the Combined \n\nData from the View1 and View2 Studies \n  \n\n \n \nIn combined data analysis of VIEW1 and VIEW2, Eylea demonstrated clinically meaningful changes \nfrom baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute Visual Function \nQuestionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) without clinically meaningful differences to ranibizumab. The \nmagnitude of these changes was similar to that seen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-\nletter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA). \n \nIn the second year of the studies, efficacy was generally maintained through the last assessment at \nweek 96, and 2-4% of patients required all injections on a monthly basis, and a third of patients \nrequired at least one injection with a treatment interval of only one month. \n \nDecreases in mean CNV area were evident in all dose groups in both studies. \n \nEfficacy results in all evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, lesion type, \nlesion size) in each study and in the combined analysis were consistent with the results in the overall \npopulations. \n \nALTAIR was a 96 week multicentre, randomised, open-label study in 247 Japanese patients with \ntreatment na\u00efve wet AMD, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Eylea following two different \nadjustment intervals (2- weeks and 4- weeks) of a treat-and-extend dosing regimen. \n \nAll patients received monthly doses of Eylea 2 mg for 3 months, followed by one injection after a \nfurther 2 month interval. At week 16, patients were randomised 1:1 into two treatment groups: 1) \nEylea treat-and-extend with 2-week adjustments and 2) Eylea treat-and-extend with 4-week \nadjustments. Extension or shortening of the treatment interval was decided based on visual and/or \nanatomic criteria defined by protocol with a maximum treatment interval of 16 weeks for both groups. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 52. The secondary \nefficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who did not lose \u226515 letters and the proportion of \npatients who gained at least 15 letters of BCVA from baseline to week 52. \n \nAt week 52, patients in the treat-and-extend arm with 2-week adjustments gained a mean of 9.0 letters \nfrom baseline as compared to 8.4 letters for those in the 4-week adjustment group [LS mean difference \nin letters (95% CI): -0.4 (-3.8,3.0), ANCOVA]. The proportion of patients who did not lose \u226515 letters \nin the two treatment arms was similar (96.7% in the 2-week and 95.9% in the 4-week adjustment \n\n\n\n  \n14 \n\n \n\ngroups). The proportion of patients who gained \u226515 letters at week 52 was 32.5% in the 2-week \nadjustment group and 30.9% in the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended \ntheir treatment interval to 12 weeks or beyond was 42.3% in the 2-week adjustment group and 49.6 % \nin the 4-week adjustment group. Furthermore, in the 4-week adjustment group 40.7% of patients were \nextended to 16 week intervals. At the last visit up to week 52, 56.8% and 57.8% of patients in the 2-\nweek and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of \n12 weeks or beyond.  \n \nIn the second year of the study, efficacy was generally maintained up to and including the last \nassessment at week 96, with a mean gain from baseline of 7.6 letters for the 2-week adjustment group \nand 6.1 letters for the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended their \ntreatment interval to 12 weeks  or beyond was 56.9% in the 2-week adjustment group and 60.2% in the \n4-week adjustment group. At the last visit prior to week 96, 64.9% and 61.2% of patients in the 2-\nweek and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of \n12 weeks or beyond. During the second year of treatment patients in both the 2-week and 4-week \nadjustment groups received an average of 3.6 and 3.7 injections, respectively. Over the 2 year \ntreatment period patients received an average of 10.4 injections. \n \nOcular and systemic safety profiles were similar to the safety observed in the pivotal studies VIEW1 \nand VIEW2. \n \nMacular oedema secondary to CRVO \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, \nsham-controlled studies in patients with macular oedema secondary to CRVO (COPERNICUS and \nGALILEO) with a total of 358 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with Eylea). Patient \nages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In the CRVO studies, approximately 52% \n(112/217) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and \napproximately 18% (38/217) were 75 years of age or older. In both studies, patients were randomly \nassigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or the control group \nreceiving sham injections every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. \n \nAfter 6 consecutive monthly injections, patients received treatment only if they met pre-specified \nretreatment criteria, except for patients in the control group in the GALILEO study who continued to \nreceive sham (control to control) until week 52. From this timepoint all patients were treated if pre-\nspecified criteria were met. \n \nIn both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least \n15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. A secondary efficacy variable was change in \nvisual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline. \n \nThe difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea in both \nstudies. The maximal improvement in visual acuity was achieved at month 3 with subsequent \nstabilisation of visual acuity and CRT until month 6. The statistically significant difference was \nmaintained through week 52. \n \nDetailed results from the analysis of both studies are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2 below. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nTable 3:  Efficacy outcomes at week 24, week 52 and week 76/100 (Full Analysis Set with LOCFC)) in COPERNICUS and GALILEO studies \n \n\n \nEfficacy Outcomes \n\nCOPERNICUS GALILEO \n\n24 Weeks 52 Weeks 100 Weeks 24 Weeks 52 Weeks 76 Weeks \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q4 \n\n(N = 114) \n\nControl \n\n \n\n(N= 73) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg  \n\n(N = 114) \n\n ControlE) \n\n (N =73) \n\nEylea F) \n\n2 mg  \n\n(N= 114) \n\nControl E,F)  \n\n(N=73) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q4 \n\n(N = 103) \n\nControl \n\n \n\n(N = 68) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg \n\n(N = 103) \n\nControl  \n\n(N = 68) \n\nEylea G) \n\n2 mg \n\n(N = 103) \n\nControl G) \n\n \n\n(N = 68) \n\nProportion of patients with \u226515 \nletters gain from baseline 56% 12% 55% 30% 49.1% 23.3% 60% 22% 60% 32% 57.3% 29.4% \n\nWeighted differenceA,B,E) \n(95% CI) \n\n44.8% \n(33.0, 56.6)  \n\n25.9% \n(11.8, 40.1)  \n\n26.7% \n(13.1, 40.3) \np=0.0003 \n\n \n38.3% \n\n(24.4, 52.1)  \n27.9% \n\n(13.0, 42.7)  \n28.0% \n\n(13.3, 42.6) \np=0.0004 \n\n \np-value p < 0.0001  p = 0.0006  p < 0.0001  p = 0.0004  \n\nMean change in BCVAC) as \nmeasured by ETDRSC) letter \nscore from baseline (SD) \n\n17.3 \n(12.8) \n\n-4.0 \n(18.0) \n\n16.2 \n(17.4) \n\n3.8 \n(17.1) \n\n13.0 \n(17.7) \n\n1.5 \n(17.7) \n\n18.0 \n(12.2) \n\n3.3 \n(14.1) \n\n16.9 \n(14.8) \n\n3.8 \n(18.1) \n\n13.7 \n(17.8) \n\n6.2 \n(17.7) \n\nDifference in LS meanA,C,D,E) \n(95% CI) \n\n21.7 \n(17.4, 26.0)  \n\n12.7 \n(7.7, 17.7)  \n\n11.8 \n(6.7, 17.0) \np < 0.0001 \n\n \n14.7 \n\n(10.8, 18.7)  \n13.2 \n\n(8.2, 18.2)  \n7.6 \n\n(2.1, 13.1) \np=0.0070 \n\n \np-value p < 0.0001  p < 0.0001  p < 0.0001  p < 0.0001  \n\n \nA)  Difference is Eylea 2 mg Q4 weeks minus control \nB) Difference and confidence interval (CI) are calculated using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for region (America vs. rest of the world for COPERNICUS and \n\nEurope vs. Asia/Pacific for GALILEO) and baseline BCVA category (> 20/200 and \u2264 20/200) \nC) BCVA: Best Corrected Visual Acuity \n\nETDRS: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study \nLOCF: Last Observation Carried Forward \nSD: Standard deviation \nLS: Least square means derived from ANCOVA \n\nD) LS mean difference and confidence interval based on an ANCOVA model with factors treatment group, region (America vs. rest of the world for COPERNICUS and Europe vs. \nAsia/Pacific for GALILEO) and baseline BCVA category (> 20/200 and \u2264 20/200) \n\nE) In COPERNICUS study, control group patients could receive Eylea on an as-needed basis as frequently as every 4 weeks during week 24 to week 52; patients had visits every \n4 weeks. \n\nF)   In COPERNICUS study, both control group and Eylea 2mg patients received Eylea 2 mg on an as-needed basis as frequently as every 4 weeks starting from week 52 to week 96; \npatients had mandatory quarterly visits but may have been seen as frequently as every 4 weeks if necessary.  \n\n\n\n  \n16 \n\n \n\nG)   In GALILEO study, both control group and Eylea 2mg patients received Eylea 2 mg on an as-needed basis every 8 weeks starting from week 52 to week 68; patients had mandatory \nvisits every 8 weeks. \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \nFigure 2:  Mean Change from Baseline to Week 76/100 in Visual Acuity by Treatment Group for \nthe COPERNICUS and GALILEO Studies (Full Analysis Set) \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n18 \n\n \n\nIn GALILEO, 86.4% (n=89) of the Eylea group and 79.4% (n=54) of the sham group had perfused \nCRVO at baseline. At week 24, this was 91.8% (n=89) in the Eylea group and 85.5% (n=47) in the \nsham group. These proportions were maintained at week 76, with 84.3% (n=75) in the Eylea group \nand 84.0% (n=42) in the sham group. \n \nIn COPERNICUS, 67.5% (n = 77) of the Eylea group and 68.5% (n = 50) of the sham group had \nperfused CRVO at baseline. At week 24, this was 87.4% (n = 90) in the Eylea group and 58.6% (n = \n34) in the sham group. These proportions were maintained at week 100 with 76.8 % (n = 76) in the \nEylea group and 78% (n = 39) in the sham group. Patients in the sham group were eligible to receive \nEylea from week 24. \n \nThe beneficial effect of Eylea treatment on visual function was similar in the baseline subgroups of \nperfused and non-perfused patients. Treatment effects in other evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, \nrace, baseline visual acuity, CRVO duration) in each study were in general consistent with the results \nin the overall populations. \n \nIn combined data analysis of GALILEO and COPERNICUS, Eylea demonstrated clinically \nmeaningful changes from baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute \nVisual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The magnitude of these changes was similar to that \nseen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity \n(BCVA). \n \nMacular oedema secondary to BRVO \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, active-\ncontrolled study in patients with macular oedema secondary to BRVO (VIBRANT) which included \nHemi-Retinal Vein Occlusion. A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with \nEylea). Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years. In the BRVO study, \napproximately 58% (53/91) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or \nolder, and approximately 23% (21/91) were 75 years of age or older. In the study, patients were \nrandomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 8 weeks following 6 initial \nmonthly injections or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline (laser control group). Patients in \nthe laser control group could receive additional laser photocoagulation (called \u2018rescue laser treatment\u2019) \nbeginning at week 12 with a minimum interval of 12 weeks. Based on pre-specified criteria, patients in \nthe laser group could receive rescue treatment with Eylea 2mg from week 24, administered every 4 \nweeks for 3 months followed by every 8 weeks.  \n \nIn the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at \nleast 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline and the Eylea group was superior to laser \ncontrol.  \n \nA secondary efficacy endpoint was change in visual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline, which \nwas statistically significant in favour of Eylea in the VIBRANT study. The course of visual \nimprovement was rapid and peaked at 3 months with maintenance of the effect until month 12. \nIn the laser group 67 patients received rescue treatment with Eylea beginning at week 24 (Active \nControl/ Eylea 2mg group), which resulted in improvement of visual acuity by about 5 letters from \nweek 24 to 52. \n \nDetailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3 below. \n\n\n\n  \n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4:  Efficacy outcomes at week 24  and week 52 (Full Analysis Set with LOCF) in VIBRANT \nstudy \n\nEfficacy Outcomes VIBRANT \n\n24 Weeks 52 Weeks \n\n Eylea 2mg Q4 \n\n(N = 91) \n\nActive Control \n(laser) \n\n(N = 90) \n\nEylea 2mg Q8 \n\n(N = 91) D) \n\nActive Control \n(laser)/Eylea 2mgE) \n\n(N = 90) \n\nProportion of patients \nwith \u226515 letters gain \nfrom Baseline (%) \n\n52.7% 26.7% 57.1% 41.1% \n\nWeighted Difference A,B) \n(%) \n\n(95% CI) \n\np-value  \n\n26.6% \n\n(13.0, 40.1) \n\np=0.0003 \n\n 16.2% \n\n(2.0, 30.5) \n\np=0.0296 \n\n \n\nMean change in BCVA \nas measured by ETDRS \nletter score from \nBaseline (SD) \n\n17.0 \n\n(11.9) \n\n 6.9 \n\n(12.9) \n\n17.1 \n\n(13.1) \n\n12.2 (11.9) \n\nDifference in LS mean \nA,C) \n\n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n\n 10.5 \n\n(7.1, 14.0) \n\np<0.0001 \n\n 5.2 \n\n(1.7, 8.7) \n\np=0.0035F) \n\n \n\nA) Difference is Eylea 2 mg Q4 weeks minus Laser Control \nB) Difference and 95% CI are calculated using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted for region (North \n\nAmerica vs. Japan) and baseline BCVA category (> 20/200 and \u2264 20/200) \nC) LS mean difference and 95% CI based on an ANCOVA model with treatment group, baseline BCVA \n\ncategory (> 20/200 and \u2264 20/200) and region (North America vs. Japan) as fixed effects, and baseline \nBCVA as covariate. \n\nD) From week 24 on the treatment interval in the Eylea treatment group was extended for all subjects from 4 \nweeks to 8 weeks through week 48. \n\nE) Beginning at week 24 subjects in the Laser Group could receive rescue treatment with Eylea, if they met at \nleast one pre-specified eligibility criterion.

At week 24 these proportions were 80% and 67%, respectively. In the Eylea group the \nproportion of perfused patients was maintained through week 52. In the laser group, where patients \nwere eligible for rescue treatment with Eylea from week 24, the proportion of perfused patients \nincreased to 78% by week 52.  \n \nDiabetic macular oedema \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, \nactive-controlled studies in patients with DME (VIVIDDME and VISTADME). A total of 862 patients \nwere treated and evaluable for efficacy, 576 with Eylea. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a \nmean of 63 years. In the DME studies, approximately 47% (268/576) of the patients randomised to \ntreatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 9% (52/576) were 75 years of \nage or older. The majority of patients in both studies had Type II diabetes. \n \nIn both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens:  \n1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (Eylea 2Q8); \n2) Eylea administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); and \n3) macular laser photocoagulation (active control). \n \nBeginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive \nadditional treatment: patients in the Eylea groups could receive laser and patients in the control group \ncould receive Eylea.  \n \nIn both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week \n52 and both Eylea 2Q8 and Eylea 2Q4 groups demonstrated statistical significance and were superior \nto the control group. This benefit was maintained through week 100. \n \n\n\n\n  \n21 \n\n \n\nDetailed results from the analysis of the VIVIDDME and VISTADME studies are shown in Table 5 and \nFigure 4 below. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nTable 5: Efficacy outcomes at week 52 and week 100 (Full Analysis Set with LOCF) in VIVIDDME and VISTADME studies \n\nEfficacy \nOutcomes \n\nVIVIDDME VISTADME \n\n52 Weeks 100 Weeks 52 Weeks 100 Weeks \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q8 A \n\n(N = 135) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q4 \n\n(N = 136) \n\nActive \nControl \n\n(laser) \n\n(N = 132) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q8 A \n\n(N = 135) \n\nEylea  \n\n2mg Q4 \n\n(N=136) \n\nActive \nControl  \n\n(laser) \n\n(N = 132) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q8 A \n\n(N = 151) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q4 \n\n(N = 154) \n\nActive \nControl \n\n(laser) \n\n(N = 154) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q8 A \n\n(N = 151) \n\nEylea \n\n2 mg Q4 \n\n(N=154) \n\nActive \nControl  \n\n(laser) \n\n(N = 154) \n\nMean change in \nBCVA as \n\nmeasured by \nETDRS E letter \n\nscore from \nBaseline \n\n10.7 10.5 1.2 9.4 11.4 0.7 10.7 12.5 0.2 11.1 11.5 0.9 \n\nDifference in LS        \n     mean B,C,E \n\n     (97.5% CI) \n\n9.1 \n\n(6.3, 11.8) \n9.3 \n\n(6.5, 12.0) \n \n\n8.2 \n\n(5.2, 11.3) \n10.7       \n\n(7.6, 13.8) \n \n\n10.45 \n\n(7.7, 13.2) \n12.19 \n\n(9.4, 15.0) \n \n\n10.1 \n\n(7.0, 13.3) \n10.6       \n\n(7.1, 14.2) \n \n\nProportion of \npatients with \u2265 15 \nletters gain from \nBaseline \n\n33% 32% 9% 31.1% 38.2% 12.1% 31% 42% 8% 33.1% 38.3% 13.0% \n\n     Adjusted   \n     Difference D,C,E \n     (97.5% CI) \n\n24% \n(13.5, 34.9) \n\n23% \n(12.6, 33.9) \n\n \n19.0%    \n\n(8.0, 29.9) \n26.1% \n\n(14.8, 37.5) \n \n\n23% \n(13.5, 33.1) \n\n34% \n(24.1, 44.4) \n\n \n20.1%         \n\n(9.6, 30.6) \n25.8% \n\n(15.1, 36.6) \n \n\n \n\nA After treatment initiation with 5 monthly injections  \n\n\n\n  \n23 \n\n \n\nB   LS mean and CI based on an ANCOVA model with baseline BCVA measurement as a covariate and a factor for treatment group.

Treatment effects in the subgroup of \npatients who had previously been treated with a VEGF inhibitor were similar to those seen in patients \nwho were VEGF inhibitor na\u00efve. \n \nPatients with bilateral disease were eligible to receive anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye if \nassessed necessary by the physician. In the VISTADME study, 217 (70.7%) of Eylea patients received \nbilateral Eylea injections until week100; in the VIVIDDME study, 97 (35.8%) of Eylea patients received \na different anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye. \n \nAn independent comparative trial (DRCR.net Protocol T) utilised a dosing regimen based on strict \nOCT and vision re-treatment criteria. In the aflibercept treatment group (n = 224) at week 52, this \ntreatment regimen resulted in patients receiving a mean of 9.2 injections, which is similar to the \nadministered number of doses in the Eylea 2Q8 group in VIVIDDME and VISTADME, while overall \n\n\n\n  \n25 \n\n \n\nefficacy of the aflibercept treatment group in Protocol T was comparable to the Eylea 2Q8 group in \nVIVIDDME and VISTADME. A 13.3 mean letter gain with 42% of patients gaining at least 15 letters in \nvision from baseline was observed in Protocol T. Ocular and systemic safety profiles (including \nATEs) were similar to VIVIDDME and VISTADME. \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, sham-\ncontrolled study in treatment-na\u00efve, Asian patients with myopic CNV. A total of 121 patients were \ntreated and evaluable for efficacy (90 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 27 to 83 years with a \nmean of 58 years. In the myopic CNV study, approximately 36% (33/91) of the patients randomised to \ntreatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 10% (9/91) were 75 years of \nage or older. \n \nPatients were randomly assigned in a 3:1  ratio to receive either 2 mg Eylea intravitreally or sham \ninjections administered once at study start with additional injections given monthly in case of disease \npersistence or recurrence until week 24, when the primary endpoint was assessed. At week 24, patients \ninitially randomised to sham were eligible to receive the first dose of Eylea. Following this, patients in \nboth groups continued to be eligible for additional injections in case of disease persistence or \nrecurrence. \n \nThe difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea for the \nprimary endpoint (change in BCVA) and confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoint (proportion of \npatients who gained 15 letters in BCVA) at week 24 compared to baseline. Differences for both \nendpoints were maintained through week 48. \n \nDetailed results from the analysis of the MYRROR study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 5 below. \n\n\n\n  \n26 \n\n \n\n \nTable 6:  Efficacy outcomes at week 24 (primary analysis) and week 48 in MYRROR study \n\n(Full Analysis Set with LOCFA)) \n\nEfficacy Outcomes MYRROR \n24 Weeks 48 Weeks \n\nEylea 2mg \n(N = 90) \n\nSham \n(N = 31) \n\nEylea 2mg \n(N = 90) \n\nSham/ \nEylea 2mg \n\n(N = 31) \nMean change in BCVA B) as measured by \nETDRS letter score from baseline (SD) B) \n\n12.1 \n(8.3) \n\n-2.0 \n(9.7) \n\n13.5 \n(8.8) \n\n3.9 \n(14.3) \n\n         Difference in LS mean C,D,E) \n        (95% CI) \n\n14.1 \n(10.8, 17.4) \n\n \n9.5 \n\n(5.4, 13.7) \n \n\nProportion of patients with \u226515 letters gain \nfrom baseline \n\n38.9% 9.7% 50.0% 29.0% \n\n        Weighted difference D,F) \n        (95% CI) \n\n29.2% \n(14.4, 44.0) \n\n \n21.0% \n\n(1.9, 40.1) \n \n\nA) LOCF: Last Observation Carried Forward \nB) BCVA: Best Corrected Visual Acuity \n\nETDRS: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study \nSD: Standard Deviation \n\nC) LS mean: Least square means derived from ANCOVA model \nD) CI: Confidence Interval \nE) LS mean difference and 95% CI based on an ANCOVA model with treatment group and country (country \n\ndesignations) as fixed effects, and baseline BCVA as covariant. \nF) Difference and 95% CI are calculated using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for country \n\n(country designations) \n \n\nFigure 5:  Mean Change from Baseline to Week 48 in Visual Acuity by Treatment Group for the \nMYRROR Study (Full Analysis Set, LOCF) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n27 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Eylea \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV \npopulations (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEylea is administered directly into the vitreous to exert local effects in the eye. \n \nAbsorption / Distribution \nAflibercept is slowly absorbed from the eye into the systemic circulation after intravitreal \nadministration and is predominately observed in the systemic circulation as an inactive, stable \ncomplex with VEGF; however only \u201cfree aflibercept\u201d is able to bind endogenous VEGF. \n \nIn a pharmacokinetic sub-study in 6 neovascular wet AMD patients with frequent sampling, maximum \nplasma concentrations of free aflibercept (systemic Cmax) were low, with a mean of approximately \n0.02 microgram/ml (range 0 to 0.054) within 1 to 3 days after a 2 mg intravitreal injection, and were \nundetectable two weeks following dosage in almost all patients. Aflibercept does not accumulate in \nthe plasma when administered intravitreally every 4 weeks. \n \nThe mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is approximately 50 to 500 times below \nthe aflibercept concentration required to inhibit the biologic activity of systemic VEGF by 50% in \nanimal models, in which blood pressure changes were observed after circulating levels of free \naflibercept attained approximately 10 microgram/ml and returned to baseline when levels fell below \napproximately 1 microgram/ml. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, \nthe mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100-fold lower than the \nconcentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF (2.91 microgram/ml) in a \nstudy of healthy volunteers. Therefore, systemic pharmacodynamic effects such as blood pressure \nchanges are unlikely. \n \nIn pharmacokinetic sub-studies in patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV mean Cmax of \nfree aflibercept in plasma were similar with values in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 microgram/ml and \nindividual values not exceeding 0.14 microgram/ml. Thereafter, plasma concentrations of free \naflibercept declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation generally within one \nweek; undetectable concentrations were reached before the next administration after 4 weeks in all \npatients. \n \nElimination \nAs Eylea is a protein-based therapeutic, no metabolism studies have been conducted. \n \nFree aflibercept binds VEGF to form a stable, inert complex. As with other large proteins, both free \nand bound aflibercept are expected to be cleared by proteolytic catabolism. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo special studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the VIEW2 study, of which 40% had renal impairment \n(24% mild, 15% moderate, and 1% severe), revealed no differences with respect to plasma \nconcentrations of active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. \n \nSimilar results were seen in patients with CRVO in the GALILEO study, in patients with DME in the \nVIVIDDME study, and in patients with myopic CNV in the MYRROR study. \n \n\n\n\n  \n28 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies on repeated dose toxicity were observed only at systemic exposures \nconsidered substantially in excess of the maximum human exposure after intravitreal administration at \nthe intended clinical dose indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nErosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with \naflibercept intravitreally were observed at systemic exposures in excess of the maximum human \nexposure. The systemic exposure based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 200- \nand 700-fold higher, respectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after \nan intravitreal dose of 2 mg. At the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye in \nmonkeys the systemic exposure was 42- and 56-fold higher based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. \n \nNo studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. \n \nAn effect of aflibercept on intrauterine development was shown in embryo-foetal development studies \nin pregnant rabbits with intravenous (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as subcutaneous (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) \nadministration. The maternal NOAEL was at the dose of 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg, respectively. A \ndevelopmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the systemic exposures based on \nCmax and cumulative AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, \nrespectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of \n2 mg. \n \nEffects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with \nintravenous administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular \nmenses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm \nmorphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. Based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept \nobserved at the 3 mg/kg intravenous dose, the systemic exposures were approximately 4,900-fold and \n1,500-fold higher, respectively, than the exposure observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of \n2 mg. All changes were reversible. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nEylea 40 mg/ml solution for injection in a vial. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml solution for injection contains 40 mg aflibercept*.  \n \nEach vial contains 100 microlitres, equivalent to 4 mg aflibercept. This provides a usable amount to \ndeliver a single dose of 50 microlitres containing 2 mg aflibercept. \n \n*Fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) \nreceptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and produced in \nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nThe solution is a clear, colourless to pale yellow and iso-osmotic solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of  \n\n\u2022 neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), \n\u2022 visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or \n\ncentral RVO) (see section 5.1), \n\u2022 visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1), \n\u2022 visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) (see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEylea is for intravitreal injection only. \n \nEylea must only be administered by a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal \ninjections. \n \nPosology \n \nwet AMD \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 50 microlitres. \n \nEylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses. The treatment \ninterval is then extended to two months. \n \nBased on the physician\u2019s judgement of visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be \nmaintained at two months or further extended using a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where \ninjection intervals are  increased in 2- or 4-weekly increments to maintain stable visual and/or \n\n\n\n  \n33 \n\n \n\nanatomic outcomes.. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be \nshortened accordingly to a minimum of two months during the first 12 months of treatment. \n \nThere is no requirement for monitoring between injections. Based on the physician\u2019s judgement the \nschedule of monitoring visits may be more frequent than the injection visits.. \n \nTreatment intervals greater than four months between injections have not been studied (see Section \n5.1). \n \nMacular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.   \nAfter the initial injection, treatment is given monthly. The interval between two doses should not be \nshorter than one month. \n \nIf visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, \nEylea should be discontinued. \n \nMonthly treatment continues until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there are no signs of \ndisease activity. Three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. \n \nTreatment may then be continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with gradually increased treatment \nintervals to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes, however there are insufficient data to \nconclude on the length of these intervals. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment \ninterval should be shortened accordingly. \n \nThe monitoring and treatment schedule should be determined by the treating physician based on the \nindividual patient\u2019s response.  \n \nMonitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging \ntechniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). \n \nDiabetic macular oedema \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.  \n \nEylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for five consecutive doses, followed by one \ninjection every two months. There is no requirement for monitoring between injections. \n \nAfter the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, and based on visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the \ntreatment interval may be extended, such as with a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where the \ntreatment intervals are gradually increased to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes; \nhowever there are insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If visual and/or \nanatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. \n \nThe schedule for monitoring should therefore be determined by the treating physician and may be \nmore frequent than the schedule of injections. \n \nIf visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, \nEylea should be discontinued. \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation \n \nThe recommended dose for Eylea is a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to \n50 microlitres.  \n \n\n\n\n  \n34 \n\n \n\nAdditional doses may be administered if visual and/or anatomic outcomes indicate that the disease \npersists. Recurrences should be treated as a new manifestation of the disease. \n \nThe schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. \n \nThe interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic and/or renal impairment \nNo specific studies in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. \n \nAvailable data do not suggest a need for a dose adjustment with Eylea in these patients (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo special considerations are needed. There is limited experience in patients older than 75 years with \nDME. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea have not been established in children and adolescents. There is no \nrelevant use of Eylea in the paediatric population for the indications of wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, \nDME and myopic CNV. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravitreal injections must be carried out according to medical standards and applicable guidelines by \na qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal injections. In general, adequate \nanaesthesia and asepsis, including topical broad spectrum microbicide (e.g. povidone iodine applied to \nthe periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface), have to be ensured. Surgical hand disinfection, sterile \ngloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) are recommended. \n \nThe injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, \navoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of \n0.05 ml is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. \n \nImmediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in \nintraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve \nhead or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. \n \nFollowing intravitreal injection patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of \nendophthalmitis (e.g. eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. \n \nEach vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye.  Extraction of multiple doses from a \nsingle vial may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. \n \nThe vial contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept. The extractable volume of the \nvial (100 microlitres) is not to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled before injecting. \n \nInjecting the entire volume of the vial could result in overdose. To expel the air bubble along with \nexcess medicinal product, slowly depress the plunger to align the cylindrical base of the dome plunger \nwith the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 50 microlitres i.e. 2 mg aflibercept). \n \nAfter injection any unused product must be discarded. \n \nFor handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n\n\n  \n35 \n\n \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance aflibercept or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nActive or suspected ocular or periocular infection. \nActive severe intraocular inflammation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravitreal injection-related reactions  \nIntravitreal injections, including those with Eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis, \nintraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic \ncataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering \nEylea. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit \nearly treatment if an infection occurs. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive \nof endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events without delay.  \n \nIncreases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including \nthose with Eylea (see section 4.8). Special precaution is needed in patients with poorly controlled \nglaucoma (do not inject Eylea while the intraocular pressure is \u2265 30 mmHg). In all cases, both the \nintraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must therefore be monitored and \nmanaged appropriately. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation, e.g. pain, \nphotophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity. \n \nSystemic effects \nSystemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have \nbeen reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that \nthese may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients with \nCRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or \nmyocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Caution should be exercised when treating such \npatients. \n \nOther \nAs with other intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV \nthe following also applies: \n \n\n\u2022 The safety and efficacy of Eylea therapy administered to both eyes concurrently have not been \nsystematically studied (see section 5.1). If bilateral treatment is performed at the same time this \ncould lead to an increased systemic exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse \nevents. \n\n\u2022 Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) \n\u2022 There is no data available on the concomitant use of Eylea with other anti-VEGF medicinal \n\nproducts (systemic or ocular). \n\u2022 Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-\n\nVEGF therapy for wet AMD, include a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. \nWhen initiating Eylea therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for \nretinal pigment epithelial tears. \n\n\u2022 Treatment should be withheld in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or \n4 macular holes. \n\n\u2022 In the event of a retinal break the dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed \nuntil the break is adequately repaired. \n\n\n\n  \n36 \n\n \n\n\u2022 The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next \nscheduled treatment in the event of: \n\no a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of \u226530 letters compared with the \nlast assessment of visual acuity; \n\no a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the \nhaemorrhage is \u226550%, of the total lesion area. \n\n\u2022 The dose should be withheld within the previous or next 28 days in the event of a performed or \nplanned intraocular surgery. \n\n\u2022 Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk \nto the foetus (see section 4.6). \n\n\u2022 Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \nleast 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.6). \n\n\u2022 There is limited experience with treatment of patients with ischaemic CRVO and BRVO. In \npatients presenting with clinical signs of irreversible ischaemic visual function loss, the \ntreatment is not recommended. \n \n\nPopulations with limited data \nThere is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes or in \ndiabetic patients with an HbA1c over 12% or with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \nEylea has not been studied in patients with active systemic infections or in patients with concurrent \neye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no experience of treatment \nwith Eylea in diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be \nconsidered by the physician when treating such patients.  \n \nIn myopic CNV there is no experience with Eylea in the treatment of non-Asian patients, patients who \nhave previously undergone treatment for myopic CNV, and patients with extrafoveal lesions.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nAdjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Eylea has not been studied, therefore, \na safety profile is not established. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least \n3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.4). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nAlthough the systemic exposure after ocular administration is very low, Eylea should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether aflibercept is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nEylea is not recommended during breast-feeding. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to abstain from Eylea therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n  \n37 \n\n \n\nFertility \nResults from animal studies with high systemic exposure indicate that aflibercept can impair male and \nfemale fertility (see section 5.3). Such effects are not expected after ocular administration with very \nlow systemic exposure. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nInjection with Eylea has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to possible \ntemporary visual disturbances associated either with the injection or the eye examination. Patients \nshould not drive or use machines until their visual function has recovered sufficiently. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nA total of 3,102 patients constituted the safety population in the eight phase III studies. Among those, \n2,501 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. \n \nSerious ocular adverse reactions in the study eye related to the injection procedure have occurred in \nless than 1 in 1,900 intravitreal injections with Eylea and included blindness, endophthalmitis, retinal \ndetachment, cataract traumatic, cataract, vitreous haemorrhage, vitreous detachment, and intraocular \npressure increased (see section 4.4). \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients treated with Eylea) were \nconjunctival haemorrhage (25%), visual acuity reduced (11%), eye pain (10%), cataract (8%), \nintraocular pressure increased (8%), vitreous detachment (7%), and vitreous floaters (7%).  \n  \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety data described below include all adverse reactions from the eight phase III studies in the \nindications wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV with a reasonable possibility of \ncausality to the injection procedure or medicinal product. \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency using the following convention: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n\n\n\n  \n38 \n\n \n\n \nTable 1:  All treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions reported in patients in phase III studies \n(pooled data of the phase III studies for the indications wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic \nCNV) or during post-marketing surveillance \n \n\nSystem \nOrgan \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity***   \n\nEye \ndisorders \n\nVisual acuity \nreduced, \nConjunctival \nhaemorrhage, \nEye pain \n\nRetinal pigment epithelial tear*, \nDetachment of the retinal \npigment epithelium, \nRetinal degeneration, \nVitreous haemorrhage, \nCataract, \nCataract cortical, \nCataract nuclear, \nCataract subcapsular,  \nCorneal erosion,  \nCorneal abrasion, \nIntraocular pressure increased, \nVision blurred, \nVitreous floaters, \nVitreous detachment, \nInjection site pain, \nForeign body sensation in \neyes, \nLacrimation increased, \nEyelid oedema, \nInjection site haemorrhage, \nPunctate keratitis, \nConjunctival hyperaemia, \nOcular hyperaemia \n\nEndophthalmitis**, \nRetinal detachment, \nRetinal tear, \nIritis, \nUveitis, \nIridocyclitis, \nLenticular opacities, \nCorneal epithelium \ndefect, \nInjection site \nirritation, \nAbnormal sensation \nin eye, \nEyelid irritation, \nAnterior chamber \nflare, \nCorneal oedema \n\nBlindness, \nCataract \ntraumatic, \nVitritis, \nHypopyon \n\n* Conditions known to be associated with wet AMD. Observed in the wet AMD studies only. \n** Culture positive and culture negative endophthalmitis \n*** During the post-marketing period, reports of hypersensitivity included rash, pruritus, urticaria, and isolated \n\ncases of severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn the wet AMD phase III studies, there was an increased incidence of conjunctival haemorrhage in \npatients receiving anti-thrombotic agents. This increased incidence was comparable between patients \ntreated with ranibizumab and Eylea. \n \nArterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are adverse events potentially related to systemic VEGF \ninhibition. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and \nmyocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. \n\n\n\n  \n39 \n\n \n\nA low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the Eylea clinical trials in \npatients with AMD, DME, RVO and myopic CNV. Across indications no notable difference between \nthe groups treated with aflibercept and the respective comparator groups were observed. \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials, doses of up to 4 mg in monthly intervals have been used and isolated cases of \noverdoses with 8 mg occurred. \n \nOverdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case of \noverdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by the treating physician, \nadequate treatment should be initiated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals / Antineovascularisation agents \nATC code: S01LA05 \n \nAflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2 \nextracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. \n \nAflibercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nAflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than \ntheir natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF \nreceptors.  \n \nMechanism of action \nVascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of \nthe VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular \npermeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR-1 and \nVEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also \npresent on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in \npathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF can synergize with VEGF-\nA in these processes, and is also known to promote leucocyte infiltration and vascular inflammation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nwet AMD \n \nWet AMD is characterised by pathological choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Leakage of blood and \nfluid from CNV may cause retinal thickening or oedema and/or sub-/intra-retinal haemorrhage, \nresulting in loss of visual acuity. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n  \n40 \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with Eylea (one injection per month for three consecutive months, followed by one \ninjection every 2 months), central retinal thickness [CRT] decreased soon after treatment initiation, \nand the mean CNV lesion size was reduced, consistent with the results seen with ranibizumab 0.5 mg \nevery month. \n \nIn the VIEW1 study there were mean decreases in CRT on optical coherence tomography (OCT) (-130 \nand -129 microns at week 52 for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and ranibizumab 0.5 mg every \nmonth study groups, respectively). Also at the 52 week time point, in the VIEW2 study there were \nmean decreases in CRT on OCT (-149 and -139 microns for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and \nranibizumab 0.5 mg every month study groups, respectively). The reduction of CNV size and \nreduction in CRT were generally maintained in the second year of the studies. \n \n\nThe ALTAIR study was conducted in Japanese patients with treatment na\u00efve wet AMD, showing \nsimilar outcomes to the VIEW studies using 3 initial monthly Eylea 2 mg injections, followed by one \ninjection after a further 2 months, and then continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with variable \ntreatment intervals (2-week or 4-week adjustments) up to a maximum 16 week interval according to \npre-specified criteria. At week 52, there were mean decreases in central retinal thickness (CRT) on \nOCT of -134.4 and \u2013126.1 microns for the 2-week adjustment group and the 4-week adjustment group, \nrespectively. The proportion of patients without fluid on OCT at week 52 was 68.3% and 69.1% in the \n2- and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively. The reduction in CRT was generally maintained in \nboth treatment arms in the second year of the ALTAIR study. \n \nMacular oedema secondary to CRVO and BRVO \n \nIn CRVO and BRVO, retinal ischaemia occurs and signals the release of VEGF which in turn \ndestabilises the tight junctions, and promotes endothelial cell proliferation. Up-regulation of VEGF is \nassociated with the breakdown of the blood retina barrier, increased vascular permeability, retinal \noedema, and neovascularisation complications. \n \nIn patients treated with 6 consecutive monthly injections of Eylea 2mg, there was a consistent, rapid \nand robust morphologic response (as measured by improvements in mean CRT) observed. At week 24, \nthe reduction in CRT was statistically superior versus control in all three studies (COPERNICUS in \nCRVO: -457 vs. -145 microns; GALILEO in CRVO: -449 vs. -169 microns; VIBRANT in BRVO: -\n280 vs. -128 microns). This decrease from baseline in CRT was maintained to the end of each study, \nweek 100 in COPERNICUS, week 76 in GALILEO, and week 52 in VIBRANT. \n \nDiabetic macular oedema \n \nDiabetic macular oedema is a consequence of diabetic retinopathy and is characterised by increased \nvasopermeability and damage to the retinal capillaries which may result in loss of visual acuity.  \n \nIn patients treated with Eylea, the majority of whom were classified as having Type II diabetes, a rapid \nand robust response in morphology (CRT, DRSS level) was observed.  \n \nIn the VIVIDDME and the VISTADME studies, a statistically significant greater mean decrease in CRT \nfrom baseline to week 52 was observed in patients treated with Eylea than with the laser control, -\n192.4 and -183.1 microns for the 2Q8 Eylea groups  and -66.2 and -73.3 microns for the control \ngroups, respectively. At week 100 the decrease was maintained with -195.8 and -191.1 microns for the \n2Q8 Eylea groups and -85.7 and -83.9 microns for the control groups, in the VIVIDDME and \nVISTADME studies, respectively. \n \nA \u2265 2 step improvement in DRSS was assessed in a pre-specified manner in VIVIDDME and \nVISTADME. The DRSS score was gradable in 73.7% of the patients in VIVIDDME and 98.3% of the \npatients in VISTADME. At week 52, 27.7% and 29.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups, and 7.5% and 14.3% \nof the control groups experienced a \u22652 step improvement in the DRSS. At week 100, the respective \n\n\n\n  \n41 \n\n \n\npercentages were 32.6% and 37.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups and 8.2% and 15.6% of the control \ngroups. \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation  \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) is a frequent cause of vision loss in adults with \npathologic myopia. It develops as a wound healing mechanism consequent to Bruch\u2019s membrane \nruptures and represents the most vision-threatening event in pathologic myopia.  \n \nIn patients treated with Eylea in the MYRROR study (one injection given at start of therapy, with \nadditional injections given in case of disease persistence or recurrence), CRT decreased soon after \ntreatment initiation favouring Eylea at week 24 (-79 microns and -4 microns for the Eylea 2 mg \ntreatment group and the control group, respectively), which was maintained through week 48. In \naddition, the mean CNV lesion size decreased.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nwet AMD \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, \nactive-controlled studies in patients with wet AMD (VIEW1 and VIEW2) with a. total of \n2,412 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (1,817 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 49 to \n99 years with a mean of 76 years. In these clinical studies, approximately 89% (1,616/1,817) of the \npatients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately \n63% (1,139/1,817) were 75 years of age or older. In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a \n1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: \n \n1) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (Eylea 2Q8); \n2) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); \n3) Eylea administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 0.5Q4); and \n4) ranibizumab administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5Q4). \n \nIn the second year of the studies, patients continued to receive the initially randomised dosage but on a \nmodified dosing schedule guided by assessment of visual and anatomic outcomes with a protocol-\ndefined maximum dosing interval of 12 weeks. \n \nIn both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in the Per Protocol Set \nwho maintained vision, i.e. losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 from baseline.  \n \nIn the VIEW1 study, at week 52, 95.1% of patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision \ncompared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. In the VIEW2 study, at week 52, 95.6% \nof patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision compared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab \n0.5Q4 group. In both studies Eylea was shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to the \nranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. \n \nDetailed results from the combined analysis of both studies are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 below. \n \n\n\n\n  \n42 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Efficacy outcomes at week 52 (primary analysis) and week 96; combined data from the \nVIEW1 and VIEW2 studiesB) \n \n\nEfficacy Outcome Eylea 2Q8 E) \n(Eylea 2 mg every 8 weeks \nfollowing 3 initial monthly \n\ndoses) \n(N = 607) \n\nRanibizumab 0.5Q4 \n(ranibizumab 0.5 mg every \n\n4 weeks) \n \n\n(N = 595) \nWeek 52 Week 96  Week 52 Week 96  \n\nMean number of injections \nfrom baseline 7.6 11.2 12.3 16.5 \n\nMean number of injections \nfrom Week 52 to 96  4.2  4.7 \n\nProportion of patients with  \n< 15 letters loss from \nbaseline (PPS A)) \n\n95.33%B) 92.42% 94.42% B) 91.60% \n\nDifferenceC) \n(95% CI)D) \n\n0.9% \n(-1.7, 3.5)F) \n\n0.8% \n(-2.3, 3.8)F)   \n\nMean change in BCVA as \nmeasured by ETDRSA) \nletter score from baseline  \n\n8.40 7.62 8.74 7.89 \n\nDifference in LS A)           \nmean change (ETDRS \nletters)C) \n\n(95% CI)D) \n\n-0.32 \n(-1.87, 1.23) \n\n-0.25 \n(-1.98, 1.49)   \n\nProportion of patients with \n\u2265 15 letters gain from \nbaseline \n\n30.97% 33.44% 32.44% 31.60% \n\nDifferenceC) \n(95% CI)D) \n\n-1.5% \n(-6.8, 3.8) \n\n1.8% \n(-3.5, 7.1)   \n\n \n\nA)  BCVA: Best Corrected Visual Acuity \n ETDRS: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study \n LS: Least square means derived from ANCOVA \n PPS: Per Protocol Set \nB)  Full Analysis Set (FAS), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) for all analyses except proportion of \n\npatients with maintained visual acuity at week 52 which is PPS \nC)  The difference is the value of the Eylea group minus the value of the ranibizumab group.

Mean Change in Visual Acuity \nfrom Baseline to Week 96 for the Combined \n\nData from the View1 and View2 Studies \n  \n\n \n \nIn combined data analysis of VIEW1 and VIEW2 Eylea demonstrated clinically meaningful changes \nfrom baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute Visual Function \nQuestionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) without clinically meaningful differences to ranibizumab. The \nmagnitude of these changes was similar to that seen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-\nletter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA). \n \nIn the second year of the studies, efficacy was generally maintained through the last assessment at \nweek 96, and 2-4% of patients required all injections on a monthly basis, and a third of patients \nrequired at least one injection with a treatment interval of only one month. \n \nDecreases in mean CNV area were evident in all dose groups in both studies. \n \nEfficacy results in all evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, lesion type, \nlesion size) in each study and in the combined analysis were consistent with the results in the overall \npopulations. \n \nALTAIR was a 96 week multicentre, randomised, open-label study in 247 Japanese patients with \ntreatment na\u00efve wet AMD, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Eylea following two different \nadjustment intervals (2-weeks and 4-weeks) of a treat-and-extend dosing regimen. \n \nAll patients received monthly doses of Eylea 2 mg for 3 months, followed by one injection after a \nfurther 2 month interval. At week 16, patients were randomised 1:1 into two treatment groups: 1) \nEylea treat-and-extend with 2-week adjustments and 2) Eylea treat-and-extend with 4-week \nadjustments. Extension or shortening of the treatment interval was decided based on visual and/or \nanatomic criteria defined by protocol with a maximum treatment interval of 16 weeks for both groups. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 52. The secondary \nefficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who did not lose \u226515 letters and the proportion of \npatients who gained at least 15 letters of BCVA from baseline to week 52. \n\n\n\n  \n44 \n\n \n\nAt week 52, patients in the treat-and-extend arm with 2-week adjustments gained a mean of 9.0 letters \nfrom baseline as compared to 8.4 letters for those in the 4-week adjustment group [LS mean difference \nin letters (95% CI): -0.4 (-3.8,3.0), ANCOVA]. The proportion of patients who did not lose \u226515 letters \nin the two treatment arms was similar (96.7% in the 2-week and 95.9% in the 4-week adjustment \ngroups). The proportion of patients who gained \u226515 letters at week 52 was 32.5% in the 2-week \nadjustment group and 30.9% in the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended \ntheir treatment interval to 12 weeks or beyond was 42.3% in the 2-week adjustment group and 49.6 % \nin the 4-week adjustment group. Furthermore, in the 4-week adjustment group 40.7% of patients were \nextended to 16 week intervals. At the last visit  up to week 52, 56. 8% and 57.8% of patients in the 2-\nweek and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of \n12 weeks or beyond.  \n \nIn the second year of the study, efficacy was generally maintained up to and including the last \nassessment at week 96, with a mean gain from baseline of 7.6 letters for the 2-week adjustment group \nand 6.1 letters for the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended their \ntreatment interval to 12 weeks  or beyond was 56.9% in the 2-week adjustment group and 60.2% in the \n4-week adjustment group. At the last visit prior to week 96, 64.9% and 61.2% of patients in the 2-\nweek and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of \n12 weeks or beyond. During the second year of treatment patients in both the 2-week and 4-week \nadjustment groups received an average of 3.6 and 3.7 injections, respectively. Over the 2 year \ntreatment period patients received an average of 10.4 injections. \n \nOcular and systemic safety profiles were similar to the safety observed in the pivotal studies VIEW1 \nand VIEW2. \n \nMacular oedema secondary to CRVO \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, \nsham-controlled studies in patients with macular oedema secondary to CRVO (COPERNICUS and \nGALILEO) with a total of 358 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with Eylea). Patient \nages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In the CRVO studies, approximately 52% \n(112/217) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and \napproximately 18% (38/217) were 75 years of age or older. In both studies, patients were randomly \nassigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or the control group \nreceiving sham injections every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. \n \nAfter 6 consecutive monthly injections, patients received treatment only if they met pre-specified \nretreatment criteria, except for patients in the control group in the GALILEO study who continued to \nreceive sham (control to control) until week 52. From this timepoint all patients were treated if pre-\nspecified criteria were met. \n \nIn both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least \n15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. A secondary efficacy variable was change in \nvisual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline. \n \nThe difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea in both \nstudies. The maximal improvement in visual acuity was achieved at month 3 with subsequent \nstabilisation of visual acuity and CRT until month 6.

At week 24, this was 87.4% (n = 90) in the Eylea group and 58.6% (n = \n34) in the sham group. These proportions were maintained at week 100 with 76.8 % (n = 76) in the \nEylea group and 78% (n = 39) in the sham group. Patients in the sham group were eligible to receive \nEylea from week 24. \n \nThe beneficial effect of Eylea treatment on visual function was similar in the baseline subgroups of \nperfused and non-perfused patients. Treatment effects in other evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, \nrace, baseline visual acuity, CRVO duration) in each study were in general consistent with the results \nin the overall populations. \n \nIn combined data analysis of GALILEO and COPERNICUS, Eylea demonstrated clinically \nmeaningful changes from baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute \nVisual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The magnitude of these changes was similar to that \nseen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity \n(BCVA). \n \nMacular oedema secondary to BRVO \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, active-\ncontrolled study in patients with macular oedema secondary to BRVO (VIBRANT) which included \nHemi-Retinal Vein Occlusion. A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with \nEylea). Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years. In the BRVO study, \napproximately 58% (53/91) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or \nolder, and approximately 23% (21/91) were 75 years of age or older. In the study, patients were \nrandomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 8 weeks following 6 initial \nmonthly injections or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline (laser control group). Patients in \nthe laser control group could receive additional laser photocoagulation (called \u2018rescue laser treatment\u2019) \nbeginning at week 12 with a minimum interval of 12 weeks. Based on pre-specified criteria, patients in \nthe laser group could receive rescue treatment with Eylea 2mg from week 24, administered every 4 \nweeks for 3 months followed by every 8 weeks.  \n \nIn the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at \nleast 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline and the Eylea group was superior to laser \ncontrol.  \n \nA secondary efficacy endpoint was change in visual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline, which \nwas statistically significant in favour of Eylea in the VIBRANT study. The course of visual \nimprovement was rapid and peaked at 3 months with maintenance of the effect until month 12. \n \nIn the laser group 67 patients received rescue treatment with Eylea beginning at week 24 (Active \nControl/ Eylea 2mg group), which resulted in improvement of visual acuity by about 5 letters from \nweek 24 to 52. \n \nDetailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3 below. \n\n\n\n  \n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4:  Efficacy outcomes at week 24 and week 52 (Full Analysis Set with LOCF) in VIBRANT \nstudy \n\nEfficacy Outcomes VIBRANT \n\n24 Weeks 52 Weeks \n\n Eylea 2mg Q4 \n\n(N = 91) \n\nActive Control \n(laser) \n\n(N = 90) \n\nEylea 2mg Q8 \n\n(N = 91)D) \nActive Control \n(laser)/Eylea \n\n2mgE) \n\n(N = 90) \n\nProportion of patients \nwith \u226515 letters gain \nfrom Baseline (%) \n\n52.7% 26.7% 57.1% 41.1% \n\nWeighted Difference A,B) \n(%) \n\n(95% CI) \n\np-value  \n\n26.6% \n\n(13.0, 40.1) \n\np=0.0003 \n\n 16.2% \n\n(2.0, 30.5) \n\np=0.0296 \n\n \n\nMean change in BCVA \nas measured by ETDRS \nletter score from \nBaseline (SD) \n\n17.0 \n\n(11.9) \n\n 6.9 \n\n(12.9) \n\n17.1 \n\n(13.1) \n\n12.2 (11.9) \n\nDifference in LS mean \nA,C) \n\n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n\n 10.5 \n\n(7.1, 14.0) \n\np<0.0001 \n\n 5.2 \n\n(1.7, 8.7) \n\np=0.0035F) \n\n \n\nA) Difference is Eylea 2 mg Q4 weeks minus Laser Control \nB) Difference and 95% CI are calculated using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted for region (North America \n\nvs. Japan) and baseline BCVA category (> 20/200 and \u2264 20/200) \nC) LS mean difference and 95% CI based on an ANCOVA model with treatment group, baseline BCVA category \n\n(> 20/200 and \u2264 20/200) and region (North America vs. Japan) as fixed effects, and baseline BCVA as covariate. \nD) From week 24 on the treatment interval in the Eylea treatment group was extended for all subjects from 4 weeks to 8 \n\nweeks through week 48. \nE) Beginning at week 24 subjects in the Laser Group could receive rescue treatment with Eylea, if they met at least one \n\npre-specified eligibility criterion.

A total of 862 patients \nwere treated and evaluable for efficacy, 576 with Eylea. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a \nmean of 63 years. In the DME studies, approximately 47% (268/576) of the patients randomised to \ntreatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 9% (52/576) were 75 years of \nage or older. The majority of patients in both studies had Type II diabetes.  \n \nIn both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: \n1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (Eylea 2Q8); \n2) Eylea administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); and \n3) macular laser photocoagulation (active control).  \nBeginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive \nadditional treatment: patients in the Eylea groups could receive laser and patients in the control group \ncould receive Eylea. \n \nIn both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week \n52 and both Eylea 2Q8 and Eylea 2Q4 groups demonstrated statistical significance and were superior \nto the control group.

Treatment effects in the subgroup of \npatients who had previously been treated with a VEGF inhibitor were similar to those seen in patients \nwho were VEGF inhibitor na\u00efve. \n \nPatients with bilateral disease were eligible to receive anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye if \nassessed necessary by the physician. In the VISTADME study, 217 (70.7%) of Eylea patients received \nbilateral Eylea injections until week100; in the VIVIDDME study, 97 (35.8%) of Eylea patients received \na different anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye. \n \nAn independent comparative trial (DRCR.net Protocol T) utilised a dosing regimen based on strict \nOCT and vision re-treatment criteria. In the aflibercept treatment group (n = 224) at week 52, this \ntreatment regimen resulted in patients receiving a mean of 9.2 injections, which is similar to the \nadministered number of doses in the Eylea 2Q8 group in VIVIDDME and VISTADME, while overall \nefficacy of the aflibercept treatment group in Protocol T was comparable to the Eylea 2Q8 group in \nVIVIDDME and VISTADME. A 13.3 mean letter gain with 42% of patients gaining at least 15 letters in \n\n\n\n  \n54 \n\n \n\nvision from baseline was observed in Protocol T. Ocular and systemic safety profiles (including \nATEs) were similar to VIVIDDME and VISTADME. \n \nMyopic choroidal neovascularisation \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, sham-\ncontrolled study in treatment-na\u00efve, Asian patients with myopic CNV. A total of 121 patients were \ntreated and evaluable for efficacy (90 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 27 to 83 years with a \nmean of 58 years. In the myopic CNV study, approximately 36% (33/91) of the patients randomised to \ntreatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 10% (9/91) were 75 years of \nage or older. \n \nPatients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either 2 mg Eylea intravitreally or sham \ninjections administered once at study start with additional injections given monthly in case of disease \npersistence or recurrence until week 24, when the primary endpoint was assessed. At week 24, patients \ninitially randomised to sham were eligible to receive the first dose of Eylea. Following this, patients in \nboth groups continued to be eligible for additional injections in case of disease persistence or \nrecurrence. \n \nThe difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea for the \nprimary endpoint (change in BCVA) and confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoint (proportion of \npatients who gained 15 letters in BCVA) at week 24 compared to baseline.

Aflibercept does not accumulate in \nthe plasma when administered intravitreally every 4 weeks. \n \nThe mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is approximately 50 to 500 times below \nthe aflibercept concentration required to inhibit the biologic activity of systemic VEGF by 50% in \nanimal models, in which blood pressure changes were observed after circulating levels of free \naflibercept attained approximately 10 microgram/ml and returned to baseline when levels fell below \napproximately 1 microgram/ml. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, \nthe mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100-fold lower than the \nconcentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF (2.91 microgram/ml) in a \nstudy of healthy volunteers. Therefore, systemic pharmacodynamic effects such as blood pressure \nchanges are unlikely. \n \n\n\n\n  \n56 \n\n \n\nIn pharmacokinetic sub-studies in patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV mean Cmax of \nfree aflibercept in plasma were similar with values in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 microgram/ml and \nindividual values not exceeding 0.14 microgram/ml. Thereafter, plasma concentrations of free \naflibercept declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation generally within one \nweek; undetectable concentrations were reached before the next administration after 4 weeks in all \npatients. \n \nElimination \nAs Eylea is a protein-based therapeutic, no metabolism studies have been conducted. \n \nFree aflibercept binds VEGF to form a stable, inert complex. As with other large proteins, both free \nand bound aflibercept are expected to be cleared by proteolytic catabolism. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo special studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the VIEW2 study, of which 40% had renal impairment \n(24% mild, 15% moderate, and 1% severe), revealed no differences with respect to plasma \nconcentrations of active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. \n \nSimilar results were seen in patients with CRVO in the GALILEO study, in patients with DME in the \nVIVIDDME study, and in patients with myopic CNV in the MYRROR study. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies on repeated dose toxicity were observed only at systemic exposures \nconsidered substantially in excess of the maximum human exposure after intravitreal administration at \nthe intended clinical dose indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nErosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with \naflibercept intravitreally were observed at systemic exposures in excess of the maximum human \nexposure. The systemic exposure based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 200- \nand 700-fold higher, respectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after \nan intravitreal dose of 2 mg. At the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye in \nmonkeys the systemic exposure was 42- and 56-fold higher based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. \n \nNo studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. \n \nAn effect of aflibercept on intrauterine development was shown in embryo-foetal development studies \nin pregnant rabbits with intravenous (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as subcutaneous (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) \nadministration. The maternal NOAEL was at the dose of 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg, respectively. A \ndevelopmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the systemic exposures based on \nCmax and cumulative AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, \nrespectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of \n2 mg. \n \nEffects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with \nintravenous administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular \nmenses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm \nmorphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. Based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept \nobserved at the 3 mg/kg intravenous dose, the systemic exposures were approximately 4,900-fold and \n1,500-fold higher, respectively, than the exposure observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of \n2 mg. All changes were reversible. \n \n \n\n\n\n  \n57 \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPolysorbate 20 \nSodium dihydrogen phosphate, monohydrate (for pH adjustment) \nDisodium hydrogen phosphate, heptahydrate (for pH adjustment) \nSodium chloride \nSucrose \nWater for injection \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nPrior to usage, the unopened vial of Eylea may be stored at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for up to \n24 hours. After opening the vial, proceed under aseptic conditions. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n100 microlitres of solution in a vial (type I glass) with a stopper (elastomeric rubber), and an 18 \nG filter needle. Pack size of 1. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe vial is for single use in one eye only. \nSince the vial contains more volume (100 microlitres) than the recommended dose (50 microlitres), a \npart of the volume contained in the vial has to be discarded prior to the administration. \n \nThe solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or discolouration or \nany variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, \ndiscard the medicinal product. \n \nFor the intravitreal injection, a 30 G x \u00bd inch injection needle should be used. \n \n\n\n\n  \n58 \n\n \n\nInstructions for use of vial: \n \n1. Remove the plastic cap and disinfect the outer part of \n\nthe rubber stopper of the vial. \n\n \n2. Attach the 18 G, 5-micron filter needle supplied in the \n\ncarton to a 1-ml sterile, Luer-lock syringe. \n\n \n3. Push the filter needle into the centre of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into \n\nthe vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. \n \n\n4. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the Eylea vial \ncontents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an \nupright position, slightly inclined to ease complete \nwithdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure \nthe bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the \nliquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal \nkeeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the \nliquid. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n     \n5. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely \n\nempty the filter needle. \n\n\n\n  \n59 \n\n \n\n6. Remove the filter needle and properly dispose of it. \nNote: Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. \n \n\n7. Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30 G x \u00bd inch \ninjection needle onto the Luer-lock syringe tip. \n\n \n\n  \n\n8. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, \ncheck the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, \ngently tap the syringe with your finger until the \nbubbles rise to the top. \n\n \n9. Eliminate all bubbles and expel excess medicinal product by slowly depressing the plunger so that \n\nthe plunger tip aligns with the line that marks 0.05 ml on the syringe. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n10. The vial is for single use only. Extraction of multiple doses  from a single vial may increase the risk \n\nof contamination and subsequent infection. \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n7.

What Eylea is and what it is used for \n \nEylea is a solution which is injected into the eye to treat eye conditions in adults called  \n \n- neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD),  \n- impaired vision due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO (BRVO) \n\nor central RVO (CRVO)), \n- impaired vision due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), \n- impaired vision due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). \n \nAflibercept, the active substance in Eylea, blocks the activity of a group of factors, known as Vascular \nEndothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF).  \n \nIn patients with wet AMD and myopic CNV, these factors, in excess are involved in the abnormal \nformation of new blood vessels in the eye. These new blood vessels can cause the leak of blood \ncomponents into the eye and eventual damage to tissues in the eye responsible for vision.  \n \nIn patients with CRVO, a blockage occurs in the main blood vessel that transports blood away from \nthe retina. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the retina and \nthereby causing a swelling of the macula, (the portion of the retina responsible for fine vision), which \nis called macular oedema. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. \n \nIn patients with BRVO, one or more branches of the main blood vessel that transports blood away \nfrom the retina is blocked. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the \nretina and thereby causing macular oedema. \n \nDiabetic macular oedema is a swelling of the retina occurring in patients with diabetes due to leaking \nof fluid from blood vessels within the macula. The macula is the portion of retina responsible for fine \nvision. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. \n \nEylea has been shown to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye which often leak \nfluid or bleed. Eylea can help to stabilise, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to wet \nAMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV. \n\n\n\n  \n79 \n\n \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Eylea \n \nYou will not be given Eylea: \n- if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 ). \n- if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye (ocular or periocular infection). \n- if you have severe inflammation of the eye (indicated by pain or redness).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Eylea: \n \n- if you have glaucoma. \n- if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters and if you have a sudden increase of size \n\nand number of floaters. \n- if surgery was performed or is planned on your eye within the previous or next four weeks. \n- if you have a severe form of CRVO or BRVO (ischaemic CRVO or BRVO), treatment with Eylea \n\nis not recommended. \n \nFurthermore, it is important for you to know that: \n \n- the safety and efficacy of Eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been \n\nstudied and if used in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. \n- injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some patients \n\nwithin 60 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. \n- if you develop an infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis) or other \n\ncomplications, you may have eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or \ndecreased vision, and increased sensitivity to light. It is important to have any symptoms \ndiagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  \n\n- your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a tear \nor detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and retinal \npigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Eylea must be given with caution. \n\n- Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to \nthe unborn child.  \n\n- women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \nleast three further months after the last injection of Eylea. \n\n \nThe systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially \nrelated to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may \nlead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea \ninto the eye. There are limited data on safety in treating patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME and \nmyopic CNV who have had a stroke or a mini-stroke (transient ischaemic attack) or a heart attack \nwithin the last 6 months. If any of these apply to you, Eylea will be given with caution.  \n \nThere is only limited experience in the treatment of  \n- patients with DME due to type I diabetes. \n- diabetics with very high average blood sugar values (HbA1c over 12%). \n- diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \n \nThere is no experience in the treatment of  \n- patients with acute infections. \n- patients with other eye conditions such as a detachment of the retina or a hole in the macula. \n- diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure.  \n- non-Asian patients with myopic CNV. \n\n\n\n  \n80 \n\n \n\n- patients previously treated for myopic CNV. \n- patients with damage outside the central part of the macula (extrafoveal lesions) for myopic CNV. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you \nwith Eylea. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Eylea in children or adolescents under 18 has not been studied because wet AMD, CRVO, \nBRVO, DME and myopic CNV occur mainly in adults. Therefore, its use in this age group is not \nrelevant. \n \nOther medicines and Eylea \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n- Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \n\nleast three further months after the last injection of Eylea. \n \n- There is no experience of using Eylea in pregnant women. Eylea should not be used during \n\npregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you \nare pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before treatment \nwith Eylea. \n\n \n- Eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding as it is not known whether Eylea passes into \n\nhuman milk. Ask your doctor for advice before starting Eylea treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAfter your injection with Eylea, you may experience some temporary visual disturbances. Do not drive \nor use machines as long as these last. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Eylea \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) of sodium per dose which means it is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How you will be given Eylea \n \nA doctor experienced in giving eye injections will inject Eylea into your eye under aseptic (clean and \nsterile) conditions.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 2 mg aflibercept (50 microlitres).  \nEylea is given as an injection into your eye (intravitreal injection).  \n \nBefore the injection your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent \ninfection. Your doctor will also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might \nhave with the injection.  \n \nwet AMD \n \nPatients with wet AMD will be treated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses, \nfollowed by another injection after a further two months.  \n \nYour doctor will then decide whether the treatment interval between injections may be kept at every \ntwo months or be gradually extended in 2- or 4-weekly intervals if your condition has been stable. If \nyour condition worsens, the interval between injections can be shortened, but to not less than every \ntwo months in the first year of treatment.  \n\n\n\n  \n81 \n\n \n\n \nUnless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you \nto see your doctor between the injections. \n \nMacular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) \n \nYour doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment schedule for you. You will start your \ntreatment with a series of monthly Eylea injections.  \n \nThe interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. \n \nYour doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea, if you are not benefiting from continued \ntreatment. \n \nYour treatment will continue with  monthly injections until your condition is stable. Three or more \nmonthly injections may be needed. \n \nYour doctor will monitor your response to treatment and may continue your treatment by gradually \nincreasing the interval between your injections to maintain a stable condition. If your condition starts \nto worsen with a longer treatment interval, your doctor will shorten the interval accordingly. \n \nBased on your response to treatment your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up \nexaminations and treatments.  \n \nDiabetic macular oedema (DME) \n \nPatients with DME will be treated with one injection per month for the first five consecutive doses \nfollowed by one injection every two months thereafter.  \n \nUnless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you \nto see your doctor between the injections. \n \nAfter the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, the treatment interval may be extended based on \nyour doctor\u2019s examination. Your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. \n \nYour doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea if it is determined that you are not benefiting \nfrom continued treatment. \n \nMyopic CNV \n \nPatients with myopic CNV will be treated with one single injection. You will receive further injections \nonly if your doctor\u2019s examinations reveal that your condition has not improved. \n \nThe interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. \n \nIf your condition goes away and then comes back, your doctor may re-start the treatment. \n \nYour doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. \n \nIf a dose of Eylea is missed \nMake a new appointment for an examination and injection. \n \nStopping treatment with Eylea \nConsult your doctor before stopping the treatment.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n\n\n  \n82 \n\n \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions (hypersensitivity) could potentially occur. These may be serious and require that \nyou contact your doctor immediately. \n \nWith administration of Eylea, there may be some side effects affecting the eyes which are due to the \ninjection procedure. Some of these may be serious and include blindness, a serious infection or \ninflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis), detachment, tear or bleeding of the light-sensitive \nlayer at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear), clouding of the lens (cataract), bleeding in \nthe eye (vitreous haemorrhage), detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina \n(vitreous detachment) and increase of pressure inside the eye, see section 2. These serious side \neffects affecting the eyes occurred in less than 1 in 1,900 injections in clinical studies. \n \nIf you experience a sudden decrease in vision, or an increase in pain and redness in your eye after your \ninjection, contact your doctor immediately.  \n \nList of side effects reported \nThe following is a list of the side effects reported to be possibly related to the injection procedure or to \nthe medicine. Please do not get alarmed, you might not experience any of these. Always discuss any \nsuspected side effects with your doctor. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- deterioration of eyesight  \n- bloodshot eye caused by bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer layers of the eye  \n- eye pain \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of the eye, resulting in flashes of light with \n\nfloaters sometimes progressing to a loss of vision (retinal pigment epithelial tear*/detachment, \nretinal detachment/tear) \n\n- degeneration of the retina (causing disturbed vision) \n- bleeding in the eye (vitreous haemorrhage) \n- certain forms of clouding of the lens (cataract) \n- damage to the front layer of the eyeball (the cornea)  \n- increase in eye pressure  \n- moving spots in vision (floaters) \n- detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina (vitreous detachment, resulting \n\nin flashes of light with floaters) \n- a feeling of having something in the eye \n- increased tear production \n- swelling of the eyelid  \n- bleeding at the injection site \n- redness of the eye  \n* Conditions known to be associated with wet AMD; observed in wet AMD patients only. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)** \n- serious inflammation or infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) \n- inflammation in the iris or other parts of the eye (iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis, anterior chamber \n\nflare) \n- abnormal sensation in the eye \n- eyelid irritation \n\n\n\n  \n83 \n\n \n\n- swelling of the front layer of the eyeball (cornea) \n** Allergic reactions like rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), and a few cases of severe allergy \n(anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions were reported. \n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- blindness \n- clouding of the lens due to injury (traumatic cataract) \n- inflammation of the gel-like substance inside the eye \n- pus in the eye  \n\n \nIn the clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer \nlayers of the eye (conjunctival haemorrhage) in patients with wet AMD receiving blood thinners. This \nincreased incidence was comparable between patients treated with ranibizumab and Eylea. \n \nThe systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially \nrelated to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may \nlead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea \ninto the eye.  \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a possibility for an immune reaction (formation of antibodies) \nwith Eylea.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Eylea \n \n\u2022 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP. \n\nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\u2022 Store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

What Eylea is and what it is used for \n \nEylea is a solution which is injected into the eye to treat eye conditions in adults called  \n \n- neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD),  \n- impaired vision due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO (BRVO) \n\nor central RVO (CRVO)), \n- impaired vision due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), \n- impaired vision due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). \n \nAflibercept, the active substance in Eylea, blocks the activity of a group of factors, known as Vascular \nEndothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF).  \n \nIn patients with wet AMD and myopic CNV, these factors, in excess are involved in the abnormal \nformation of new blood vessels in the eye. These new blood vessels can cause the leak of blood \ncomponents into the eye and eventual damage to tissues in the eye responsible for vision.  \n \nIn patients with CRVO, a blockage occurs in the main blood vessel that transports blood away from \nthe retina. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the retina and \nthereby causing a swelling of the macula, (the portion of the retina responsible for fine vision), which \nis called macular oedema. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. \n \nIn patients with BRVO, one or more branches of the main blood vessel that transports blood away \nfrom the retina is blocked. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the \nretina and thereby causing macular oedema. \n \nDiabetic macular oedema is a swelling of the retina occurring in patients with diabetes due to leaking \nof fluid from blood vessels within the macula. The macula is the portion of retina responsible for fine \nvision. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. \n \nEylea has been shown to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye which often leak \nfluid or bleed. Eylea can help to stabilise, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to wet \nAMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV. \n\n\n\n  \n88 \n\n \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Eylea \n \nYou will not be given Eylea: \n- if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 ). \n- if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye (ocular or periocular infection). \n- if you have severe inflammation of the eye (indicated by pain or redness).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Eylea: \n \n- if you have glaucoma. \n- if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters and if you have a sudden increase of size \n\nand number of floaters. \n- if surgery was performed or is planned on your eye within the previous or next four weeks. \n- if you have a severe form of CRVO or BRVO (ischaemic CRVO or BRVO), treatment with Eylea \n\nis not recommended. \n \nFurthermore, it is important for you to know that: \n \n- the safety and efficacy of Eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been \n\nstudied and if used in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. \n- injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some patients \n\nwithin 60 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. \n- if you develop an infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis) or other \n\ncomplications, you may have eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or \ndecreased vision, and increased sensitivity to light. It is important to have any symptoms \ndiagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  \n\n- your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a tear \nor detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and retinal \npigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Eylea must be given with caution. \n\n- Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to \nthe unborn child.  \n\n- women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \nleast three further months after the last injection of Eylea. \n\n \nThe systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially \nrelated to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may \nlead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea \ninto the eye. There are limited data on safety in treating patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME and \nmyopic CNV who have had a stroke or a mini-stroke (transient ischaemic attack) or a heart attack \nwithin the last 6 months. If any of these apply to you, Eylea will be given with caution.  \n \nThere is only limited experience in the treatment of  \n- patients with DME due to type I diabetes. \n- diabetics with very high average blood sugar values (HbA1c over 12%). \n- diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \n \nThere is no experience in the treatment of  \n- patients with acute infections. \n- patients with other eye conditions such as a detachment of the retina or a hole in the macula. \n- diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure.  \n- non-Asian patients with myopic CNV. \n\n\n\n  \n89 \n\n \n\n- patients previously treated for myopic CNV. \n- patients with damage outside the central part of the macula (extrafoveal lesions) for myopic CNV. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you \nwith Eylea. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Eylea in children or adolescents under 18 has not been studied because wet AMD, CRVO, \nBRVO, DME and myopic CNV occur mainly in adults. Therefore, its use in this age group is not \nrelevant. \n \nOther medicines and Eylea \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n- Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \n\nleast three further months after the last injection of Eylea. \n \n- There is no experience of using Eylea in pregnant women. Eylea should not be used during \n\npregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you \nare pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before treatment \nwith Eylea. \n\n \n- Eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding as it is not known whether Eylea passes into \n\nhuman milk. Ask your doctor for advice before starting Eylea treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAfter your injection with Eylea, you may experience some temporary visual disturbances. Do not drive \nor use machines as long as these last. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Eylea \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) of sodium per dose which means it is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How you will be given Eylea \n \nA doctor experienced in giving eye injections will inject Eylea into your eye under aseptic (clean and \nsterile) conditions.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 2 mg aflibercept (50 microlitres).  \nEylea is given as an injection into your eye (intravitreal injection).  \n \nBefore the injection your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent \ninfection. Your doctor will also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might \nhave with the injection.  \n \nwet AMD \n \nPatients with wet AMD will be treated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses, \nfollowed by another injection after a further  two months.  \n \nYour doctor will then decide whether the treatment interval between injections may be kept at every \ntwo months or be gradually extended in 2- or 4-weekly intervals if your condition has been stable. If \nyour condition worsens, the interval between injections can be shortened, but to not less than every \ntwo months in the first year of treatment.  \n\n\n\n  \n90 \n\n \n\n \nUnless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you \nto see your doctor between the injections. \n \nMacular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) \n \nYour doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment schedule for you. You will start your \ntreatment with a series of monthly Eylea injections.  \n \nThe interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. \n \nYour doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea, if you are not benefiting from continued \ntreatment. \n \nYour treatment will continue with  monthly injections until your condition is stable. Three or more \nmonthly injections may be needed. \n \nYour doctor will monitor your response to treatment and may continue your treatment by gradually \nincreasing the interval between your injections to maintain a stable condition. If your condition starts \nto worsen with a longer treatment interval, your doctor will shorten the interval accordingly. \n \nBased on your response to treatment your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up \nexaminations and treatments.  \n \nDiabetic macular oedema (DME) \n \nPatients with DME will be treated with one injection per month for the first five consecutive doses \nfollowed by one injection every two months thereafter.  \n \nUnless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you \nto see your doctor between the injections. \n \nAfter the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, the treatment interval may be extended based on \nyour doctor\u2019s examination. Your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. \n \nYour doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea if it is determined that you are not benefiting \nfrom continued treatment. \n \nMyopic CNV \n \nPatients with myopic CNV will be treated with one single injection. You will receive further injections \nonly if your doctor\u2019s examinations reveal that your condition has not improved. \n \nThe interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. \n \nIf your condition goes away and then comes back, your doctor may re-start the treatment. \n \nYour doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. \n \nIf a dose of Eylea is missed \nMake a new appointment for an examination and injection. \n \nStopping treatment with Eylea \nConsult your doctor before stopping the treatment.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n\n\n  \n91 \n\n \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions (hypersensitivity) could potentially occur. These may be serious and require that \nyou contact your doctor immediately. \n \nWith administration of Eylea, there may be some side effects affecting the eyes which are due to the \ninjection procedure. Some of these may be serious and include blindness, a serious infection or \ninflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis), detachment, tear or bleeding of the light-sensitive \nlayer at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear), clouding of the lens (cataract), bleeding in \nthe eye (vitreous haemorrhage), detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina \n(vitreous detachment) and increase of pressure inside the eye, see section 2. These serious side \neffects affecting the eyes occurred in less than 1 in 1,900 injections in clinical studies. \n \nIf you experience a sudden decrease in vision, or an increase in pain and redness in your eye after your \ninjection, contact your doctor immediately.  \n \nList of side effects reported \nThe following is a list of the side effects reported to be possibly related to the injection procedure or to \nthe medicine. Please do not get alarmed, you might not experience any of these. Always discuss any \nsuspected side effects with your doctor. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- deterioration of eyesight  \n- bloodshot eye caused by bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer layers of the eye  \n- eye pain \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of the eye, resulting in flashes of light with \n\nfloaters sometimes progressing to a loss of vision (retinal pigment epithelial tear*/detachment, \nretinal detachment/tear) \n\n- degeneration of the retina (causing disturbed vision) \n- bleeding in the eye (vitreous haemorrhage) \n- certain forms of clouding of the lens (cataract) \n- damage to the front layer of the eyeball (the cornea) \n- increase in eye pressure  \n- moving spots in vision (floaters) \n- detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina (vitreous detachment, resulting \n\nin flashes of light with floaters) \n- a feeling of having something in the eye \n- increased tear production \n- swelling of the eyelid  \n- bleeding at the injection site \n- redness of the eye  \n* Conditions known to be associated with wet AMD; observed in wet AMD patients only. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)** \n- serious inflammation or infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) \n- inflammation in the iris or other parts of the eye (iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis, anterior chamber \n\nflare) \n- abnormal sensation in the eye \n- eyelid irritation \n\n\n\n  \n92 \n\n \n\n- swelling of the front layer of the eyeball (cornea) \n** Allergic reactions like rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), and a few cases of severe allergy \n(anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions were reported. \n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- blindness \n- clouding of the lens due to injury (traumatic cataract) \n- inflammation of the gel-like substance inside the eye \n- pus in the eye  \n\n \nIn the clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer \nlayers of the eye (conjunctival haemorrhage) in patients with wet AMD receiving blood thinners. This \nincreased incidence was comparable between patients treated with ranibizumab and Eylea. \n \nThe systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially \nrelated to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may \nlead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea \ninto the eye.  \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a possibility for an immune reaction (formation of antibodies) \nwith Eylea.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Eylea \n \n\u2022 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP. \n\nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\u2022 Store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

In the event of either being observed, \ndiscard the medicinal product. \n \nPrior to usage, the unopened vial of Eylea may be stored at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for up to \n24 hours. After opening the vial, proceed under aseptic conditions. \nFor the intravitreal injection, a 30 G x \u00bd inch injection needle should be used. \n \n \nInstructions for use of vial: \n \n1. Remove the plastic cap and disinfect the outer part of \n\nthe rubber stopper of the vial. \n\n \n2. Attach the 18 G, 5-micron filter needle supplied in the \n\ncarton to a 1 ml sterile Luer-lock syringe. \n\n \n3. Push the filter needle into the centre of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into \n\nthe vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n  \n95 \n\n \n\n4. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the Eylea vial \ncontents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright \nposition, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. \nTo deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the \nfilter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to \ntilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the \nfilter needle submerged in the liquid. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n     \n5. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely \n\nempty the filter needle. \n6. Remove the filter needle and properly dispose of it. \n\nNote: Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. \n \n \n\n7. Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30 G x \u00bd inch \ninjection needle onto the Luer-lock syringe tip. \n\n \n\n  \n\n8. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check \nthe syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap \nthe syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the \ntop. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n96 \n\n \n\n9. Eliminate all bubbles and expel excess medicinal product by slowly depressing the plunger so that \nthe plunger tip aligns with the line that marks 0.05 ml on the syringe. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n10. The vial is for single use only. Extraction of multiple doses from a single vial may increase the risk \n\nof contamination and subsequesnt infection. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what eylea is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "eylea is a solution which is injected into the eye to treat eye conditions in adults called - neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet amd), - impaired vision due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch rvo (brvo) or central rvo (crvo)), - impaired vision due to diabetic macular oedema (dme), - impaired vision due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic cnv). aflibercept, the active substance in eylea, blocks the activity of a group of factors, known as vascular endothelial growth factor a (vegf-a) and placental growth factor (plgf). in patients with wet amd and myopic cnv, these factors, in excess are involved in the abnormal formation of new blood vessels in the eye. these new blood vessels can cause the leak of blood components into the eye and eventual damage to tissues in the eye responsible for vision. in patients with crvo, a blockage occurs in the main blood vessel that transports blood away from the retina. vegf levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the retina and thereby causing a swelling of the macula, (the portion of the retina responsible for fine vision), which is called macular oedema. when the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. in patients with brvo, one or more branches of the main blood vessel that transports blood away from the retina is blocked. vegf levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the retina and thereby causing macular oedema. diabetic macular oedema is a swelling of the retina occurring in patients with diabetes due to leaking of fluid from blood vessels within the macula. the macula is the portion of retina responsible for fine vision. when the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. eylea has been shown to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye which often leak fluid or bleed. eylea can help to stabilise, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to wet amd, crvo, brvo, dme and myopic cnv.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "eylea", "Type":

"you will not be given eylea: - if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 ). - if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye (ocular or periocular infection). - if you have severe inflammation of the eye (indicated by pain or redness). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before you are given eylea: - if you have glaucoma. - if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters and if you have a sudden increase of size and number of floaters. - if surgery was performed or is planned on your eye within the previous or next four weeks. - if you have a severe form of crvo or brvo (ischaemic crvo or brvo), treatment with eylea is not recommended. furthermore, it is important for you to know that: - the safety and efficacy of eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been studied and if used in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. - injections with eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some patients within 60 minutes of the injection. your doctor will monitor this after each injection. - if you develop an infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis) or other complications, you may have eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, and increased sensitivity to light. it is important to have any symptoms diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. - your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case eylea must be given with caution. - eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. - women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least three further months after the last injection of eylea. the systemic use of vegf inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in eylea, is potentially related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may lead to heart attack or stroke. there is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of eylea into the eye. there are limited data on safety in treating patients with crvo, brvo, dme and myopic cnv who have had a stroke or a mini-stroke (transient ischaemic attack) or a heart attack within the last 6 months. if any of these apply to you, eylea will be given with caution. there is only limited experience in the treatment of - patients with dme due to type i diabetes. - diabetics with very high average blood sugar values (hba1c over 12%). - diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. there is no experience in the treatment of - patients with acute infections. - patients with other eye conditions such as a detachment of the retina or a hole in the macula. - diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure. - non-asian patients with myopic cnv. - patients previously treated for myopic cnv. - patients with damage outside the central part of the macula (extrafoveal lesions) for myopic cnv. if any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you with eylea. children and adolescents the use of eylea in children or adolescents under 18 has not been studied because wet amd, crvo, brvo, dme and myopic cnv occur mainly in adults. therefore, its use in this age group is not relevant. other medicines and eylea tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding - women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least three further months after the last injection of eylea. - there is no experience of using eylea in pregnant women. eylea should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before treatment with eylea. - eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding as it is not known whether eylea passes into human milk. ask your doctor for advice before starting eylea treatment. driving and using machines after your injection with eylea, you may experience some temporary visual disturbances. do not drive or use machines as long as these last. important information about some of the ingredients of eylea this medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) of sodium per dose which means it is essentially \"sodium-free\".",

your eye carefully to prevent infection. your doctor will also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection. wet amd patients with wet amd will be treated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses, followed by another injection after a further two months. your doctor will then decide whether the treatment interval between injections may be kept at every two months or be gradually extended in 2- or 4-weekly intervals if your condition has been stable. if your condition worsens, the interval between injections can be shortened, but to not less than every two months in the first year of treatment. unless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you to see your doctor between the injections. macular oedema secondary to rvo (branch rvo or central rvo) your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment schedule for you. you will start your treatment with a series of monthly eylea injections. the interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. your doctor may decide to stop treatment with eylea, if you are not benefiting from continued treatment. your treatment will continue with monthly injections until your condition is stable. three or more monthly injections may be needed. your doctor will monitor your response to treatment and may continue your treatment by gradually increasing the interval between your injections to maintain a stable condition. if your condition starts to worsen with a longer treatment interval, your doctor will shorten the interval accordingly. based on your response to treatment your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations and treatments. diabetic macular oedema (dme) patients with dme will be treated with one injection per month for the first five consecutive doses followed by one injection every two months thereafter. unless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you to see your doctor between the injections. after the first 12 months of treatment with eylea, the treatment interval may be extended based on your doctor's examination. your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. your doctor may decide to stop treatment with eylea if it is determined that you are not benefiting from continued treatment. myopic cnv patients with myopic cnv will be treated with one single injection. you will receive further injections only if your doctor's examinations reveal that your condition has not improved. the interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. if your condition goes away and then comes back, your doctor may re-start the treatment. your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. if a dose of eylea is missed make a new appointment for an examination and injection. stopping treatment with eylea consult your

this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) could potentially occur. these may be serious and require that you contact your doctor

infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis), detachment, tear or bleeding of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear), clouding of the lens (cataract), bleeding in the eye (vitreous haemorrhage), detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina (vitreous detachment) and increase of pressure inside the eye, see section 2. these serious side effects affecting the eyes occurred in less than 1 in 1,900 injections in clinical studies. if you experience a sudden decrease in vision, or an increase in pain and redness in your eye after your injection, contact your doctor immediately. list of side effects reported the following is a list of the side effects reported to be possibly related to the injection procedure or to the medicine. please do not get alarmed, you might not experience any of these. always discuss any suspected side effects with your doctor. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - deterioration of eyesight - bloodshot eye caused by bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer layers of the eye - eye pain common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of the eye, resulting in flashes of light with floaters sometimes progressing to a loss of vision (retinal pigment epithelial tear*/detachment, retinal detachment/tear) - degeneration of the retina (causing disturbed vision) - bleeding in the eye (vitreous haemorrhage) - certain forms of clouding of the lens (cataract) - damage to the front layer of the eyeball (the cornea) - increase in eye pressure - moving spots in vision (floaters) - detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina (vitreous detachment, resulting in flashes of light with floaters) - a feeling of having something in the eye - increased tear production - swelling of the eyelid - bleeding at the injection site - redness of the eye * conditions known to be associated with wet amd; observed in wet amd patients only. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)** - serious inflammation or infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) - inflammation in the iris or other parts of the eye (iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis, anterior chamber flare) - abnormal sensation in the eye - eyelid irritation 83 - swelling of the front layer of the eyeball (cornea) ** allergic reactions like rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), and a few cases of severe allergy (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions were reported. rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): - blindness - clouding of the lens due to injury (traumatic cataract) - inflammation of the gel-like substance inside the eye - pus in the eye in the clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer layers of the eye (conjunctival haemorrhage) in patients with wet amd receiving blood thinners. this increased incidence was comparable between patients treated with ranibizumab and eylea. the systemic use of vegf inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in eylea, is potentially related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may lead to heart attack or stroke. there is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of eylea into the eye. as with all therapeutic proteins, there is a possibility for an immune reaction (formation of antibodies) with
