CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nShort term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in adults, adolescents, infants and \nchildren (aged from nine months) (see section 5.1): \n \n\n\u2022 Impetigo. \n \n\n\u2022 Infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds.  \n \nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information regarding the clinical activity of retapamulin \nagainst different types of Staphylococcus aureus. \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial medicinal \nproducts. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (aged 18-65 years), adolescents (aged 12-17 years), infants and children (aged from nine \nmonths to 11 years) \n \nA thin layer of ointment should be applied to the affected area twice daily for five days.  \nThe area treated may be covered with sterile bandage or gauze dressing. \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been established in the following: \n \n\u2022 Impetiginous lesions >10 in number and exceeding 100 cm2 in total surface area. \n\n \n\u2022 Infected lesions that exceed 10 cm in length or a total surface area >100 cm2.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nIn patients aged less than 18 years the total surface area treated should be no more than 2% of the body \nsurface area. \n \nPatients not showing a clinical response within two to three days should be re-evaluated and \nalternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (aged 65 and older) \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary. \n \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary.  See section 5.3.  \n \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary.  See section 5.3.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of retapamulin ointment in infants less than nine months of age has not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRetapamulin is for cutaneous use only. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSensitisation or severe local irritation  \n \nIn the event of a sensitisation or severe local irritation from the use of retapamulin ointment, treatment \nshould be discontinued, the ointment carefully wiped off, and appropriate alternative therapy for the \ninfection instituted. \n \nEyes and mucous membranes \n \nRetapamulin ointment must be kept away from the eyes and mucous membranes. Epistaxis has been \nreported with use of Altargo on nasal mucosa.   \n \nIngestion \n \nCare must be taken to avoid ingestion. \n \nRe-evaluation of treatment \n \nAlternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or a worsening in the infected \narea after 2-3 days of treatment. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nProlonged use and overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms \n \nProlonged use of retapamulin may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms, including \nfungi.  If super-infection with a non-susceptible organism is suspected, treatment should be guided by \nclinical and microbiological assessments. \n \nAbscesses \n \nRetapamulin should not be used to treat abscesses. \n \nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) \n \nRetapamulin should not be used to treat infections known or thought likely to be due to MRSA (see \nsection 5.1). \nIn clinical studies of secondarily infected open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was inadequate in \npatients with infections caused by MRSA.  The reason for the reduced clinical efficacy observed in \nthese patients is unknown. \n \nButylated hydroxytoluene \n \nRetapamulin ointment contains butylated hydroxytoluene, which may cause local skin reaction (e.g. \ncontact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe effect of concurrent application of retapamulin and other topical medicinal products to the same \narea of skin has not been studied, and is not recommended. \n \nIn human liver microsomes, retapamulin was shown to be a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. However, \nsince plasma concentrations of retapamulin during topical application have been low (see section 5.2), \nit is not expected that concurrent systemic administration of CYP3A4 substrates will result in \nclinically important inhibition of their metabolism by retapamulin.  \n \nCo-administration of oral ketoconazole 200mg twice daily increased mean retapamulin AUC(0-24) and \nCmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin 10 mg/g ointment on the abraded skin of healthy \nadult males.  Nevertheless, the highest plasma concentrations recorded were low (< 10.5 ng/ml in the \nabsence of ketoconazole and < 17 ng/ml in the presence of ketoconazole. \n \nSystemic exposure to retapamulin has been low following topical application of 10 mg/g ointment in \nadult and paediatric patients aged 2 years and older (maximum plasma concentration < 20 ng/mL). \nTherefore it is not expected that clinically important increases in plasma concentrations of retapamulin \nwill occur in patients aged 2 years and older who are also receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn children aged from 9 months to 2 years it is possible that higher plasma concentrations may \noccasionally occur during treatment with retapamulin 10 mg/g ointment compared to older children \nand adults. Therefore caution is advised if retapamulin 10 mg/g ointment is administered to children in \nthis age group who are also receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, as further increase in systemic exposure to \nretapamulin may occur upon CYP3A4 inhibition.  \n \nSee section 5.2 regarding plasma concentrations of retapamulin observed in patients in different age \ngroups. \n \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.  Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity after oral administration and are insufficient with respect to effects on parturition and \nfetal/postnatal development (see section 5.3).  \n \nRetapamulin ointment should only be used in pregnancy when topical antibacterial therapy is clearly \nindicated and the use of retapamulin is considered to be preferable to administration of a systemic \nantibacterial medicinal product. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether retapamulin is excreted in human breast milk.  Minimal systemic exposure is \nobserved in adults, therefore exposure of the breast-feeding infant is likely to be negligible. The \nexcretion of retapamulin in milk has not been studied in animals.  A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Altargo should be made \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Altargo therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of retapamulin on human fertility.  No treatment-related effects on \nmale or female fertility have been shown in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAltargo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical studies in which 2150 patients with superficial skin infections applied Altargo, the most \ncommonly reported adverse reaction was application site irritation, which affected approximately 1% \nof patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of frequency: \nvery common (>1/10), common (>1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (>1/1000 to <1/100), \nrare (>1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nOrgan systems Common  Uncommon \n\n \nNot known \n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity, \nincluding angioedema \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n \n \n\n Contact dermatitis  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nApplication \nsite reactions \n \nIrritation \n\nApplication site \nreactions \n \nPain \nPruritus \nErythema \n\nApplication site \nirritation (including \nburning sensation) \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the paediatric population are the same as in \nadults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAny signs or symptoms of overdose, either topically or by accidental ingestion, should be treated \nsymptomatically. \nNo specific antidote is known.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use, Antibiotics for \ntopical use. ATC code: D06AX13 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRetapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of the compound pleuromutilin, which is isolated through \nfermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus). \n \nRetapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting at a unique site on the 50S \nsubunit of the bacterial ribosome that is distinct from the binding sites of other non-pleuromutilin \nantibacterial agents that interact with the ribosome. \n \nData indicate that the binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal \nP site and peptidyl transferase centre.  By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl \ntransfer, partially block P-site interactions, and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal \nsubunits. Therefore the pleuromutilins appear to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by multiple \nmechanisms.  \n \nRetapamulin is predominantly bacteriostatic against S. aureus and S. pyogenes.  \n \n\n \nMechanism of resistance  \n\nDue to its distinct mode of action, target specific cross-resistance with other classes of antibacterial \nagents is rare. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nIn vitro, three mechanisms have been identified which reduce susceptibility to retapamulin. One \ninvolves mutations in ribosomal protein L3, the second is a non-specific efflux mechanism (ABC \ntransporter vgaAv). This non-target specific efflux mechanism has also been demonstrated to reduce \nthe in vitro activity of streptogramin A. \n \nSusceptibility to pleuromutilins can also be affected by the Cfr rRNA methyltransferase, which \nconfers cross-resistance to phenicols, lincosamides and streptogramin A in staphylococci.   \n \nRetapamulin MICs of 2-64 \u00b5g/ml have been reported for clinical isolates of S. aureus possessing \neither the efflux or cfr resistance mechanisms described above. For S. aureus isolates with laboratory-\ngenerated mutations in ribosomal protein L3, retapamulin MICs were 0.25-4 \u00b5g/ml. While the S. \naureus epidemiological cut off value for retapamulin is 0.5 \u00b5g/ml, the clinical significance of isolates \nwith elevated retapamulin MICs is unknown due to the potential for high local concentrations \n(20,000 \u00b5g/ml) of retapamulin on the skin. \n \nNo development of resistance was observed during treatment with retapamulin in the clinical study \nprogramme and all clinical isolates were inhibited by retapamulin concentrations of <2 \u00b5g/ml. \n \nAntibacterial spectrum \n \nThe prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species, and \nlocal information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. As necessary, \nexpert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the \nagent in at least some types of infection is questionable. \n \n\nCommonly susceptible species \n \nStaphylococcus aureus* $ \n \nStreptococcus pyogenes* \n \nStreptococcus agalactiae \n \nInherently resistant organisms \n \nEnterobacteriaceae \n \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \n \nEnterococcus faecalis \n \n\n \n\n$ In vitro, retapamulin was equally active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant \nstrains of S. aureus.  However, see section 4.4 and below regarding clinical efficacy against MRSA. \nRetapamulin should not be used to treat infections known or thought likely to be due to MRSA. \n \n* Activity has been satisfactorily demonstrated in clinical studies \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nVery few MRSA were isolated in studies in impetigo and all were clinical successes (100%: 8/8).  \nIn studies in impetigo and in two studies of secondarily infected open wounds (SIOW), clinical \nsuccess rates were high for retapamulin in patients with mupirocin-resistant S. aureus (100%: 11/11) \nor fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus (96.7%: 29/30).  However, in the two studies that enrolled patients \nwith SIOW the efficacy of retapamulin in infections due to MRSA was inadequate (75.7%).

In the case of treatment failure associated \nwith S. aureus, the presence of strains possessing additional virulence factors (such as Panton-\nValentine Leukocidin) should be considered.  \n \n\nClinical Success Rates at Follow up for SIOW patients with S. aureus \nPhenotype/PFGE \ntype \n\nRETAPAMULIN Cephalexin \nn/N Success \n\nRate (%) \n95% Exact \n\nCI \nn/N Success \n\nRate (%) \nS. aureus (all) 337/379 88.9 (85.3,91.9) 155/186 83.3 \n   MRSA $ 28/37 75.7 (58.8,88.2) 21/26 80.8 \n   MSSA 309/342 90.4 (86.7,93.3) 133/159 83.6 \n\nCI: confidence interval.

Lesions of subjects treated with retapamulin healed more quickly by the End of \ntherapy visit (day 7-9), with a reduction in size of the lesions by 77.3% compared to 43.5% for \nplacebo treated subjects. However by the Follow-up visit this difference was less pronounced, (88.6% \nvs, 81% for retapamulin and placebo treated subjects respectively). \n \nIn the Intent to Treat Bacteriological evaluable population, the clinical success rate of retapamulin \n(76.4%: 139/182) was statistically superior to that of placebo (64.3%; 54/84). This difference was \nprimarily due to the higher success rate observed in retapamulin-treated subjects with infections \ncaused by S. aureus in comparison to placebo treated subjects (see Table below).

Systemic exposure following topical \napplication of retapamulin through intact skin was very low. The geometric mean Cmax value in plasma \nafter application to 200 cm2 of abraded skin was 9.75 ng/ml on day 1 and 8.79 ng/ml on day 7, and the \nmaximum individual systemic exposure (Cmax) recorded was 22.1 ng/ml. \n \nPatients from the age of 2 years \n \nSingle plasma samples were obtained from 516 adult and paediatric patients who received topical \ntreatment with retapamulin 10 mg/g ointment twice daily for 5 days for the treatment of secondarily \ninfected traumatic lesions.  Sampling occurred pre-dose for adult subjects on days 3 or 4, and between \n0-12 hours after the last application for paediatric subjects on days 3 or 4.  The majority of samples \n(89%) were below the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/ml). Of the samples that had measurable \nconcentrations 90% had retapamulin concentrations less than 2.5 ng/ml.  The maximum measured \nplasma concentration of retapamulin was 10.7 ng/ml in adults and 18.5 ng/ml in paediatric patients \n(aged 2-17 years). \n \nPatients aged from 2 months to 24 months \n \nSingle plasma samples were obtained approximately 4-8 hours after the first application on days 3 or 4 \nfrom patients aged from 2 months to 2 years with impetigo or with secondarily infected traumatic \nlesions or dermatoses (note that retapamulin is not indicated for use in secondarily infected \ndermatoses). Retapamulin concentrations were measurable in 46% (36/79) of samples (range 0.52 to \n177.3 ng/ml) but the majority of these samples (27/36; 75%) contained < 5.0 ng/ml. \n \nAmong the children aged from 9 months to 2 years plasma concentrations of retapamulin were \nmeasurable in 32% (16/50) of samples. A single retapamulin concentration (95.1 ng/ml) exceeded the \nhighest concentration observed in patients aged 2-17 years (18.5 ng/ml). This plasma concentration \nwas observed in a child with a secondary infected dermatosis, for which retapamulin is not indicated \nfor use. \n \nRetapamulin is not recommended for use in children aged less than 9 months. In children aged from 2 \nmonths to 9 months plasma concentrations of retapamulin were measurable in 69% (20/29) of \nsamples. Four plasma retapamulin concentrations (26.9, 80.3, 174.3, and 177.3 ng/ml) exceeded the \nhighest concentration observed in patients aged 2-17 years (18.5 ng/ml).  \n \nDistribution \n \nDue to the very low systemic exposures, tissue distribution of retapamulin has not been investigated in \nhumans.   \n \nIn vitro, retapamulin was shown to be a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate and inhibitor. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nHowever, the maximum individual systemic exposure in humans following topical application of \n10 mg/g ointment on 200 cm2 of abraded skin (Cmax= 22 ng/ml; AUC(0-24) = 238 ng.h/ml) was 660-fold \nlower than the retapamulin IC50  for Pgp inhibition.  \n \nRetapamulin is approximately 94% bound to human plasma proteins.  \n \n \n \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated \nby CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).  \n \nElimination \n \nRetapamulin elimination in humans has not been investigated.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  However, due to \nthe low systemic plasma levels that have been observed, no safety problems are foreseen. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity \n \nIn 14-day (50, 150 or 450 mg/kg) oral toxicity studies in rats there was evidence of adaptive hepatic \nand thyroid changes.  Neither of these findings is of clinical relevance. \n \nIn monkeys dosed orally (50, 150 or 450 mg/kg) for 14 days there was dose-related emesis. \n \nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis, reproductive toxicity \nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with \nretapamulin. \n \nThere was no evidence of genotoxicity when evaluated in vitro for gene mutation and/or chromosomal \neffects in the mouse lymphoma cell assay, in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes, or when \nevaluated in vivo for chromosomal effects in a rat micronucleus test.  \n \nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility in male or female rats at oral doses of 50, 150, or \n450 mg/kg/day, resulting in exposure margins of up to 5-times the highest human estimated exposure \n(topical application to 200 cm2 abraded skin: AUC 238 ng.h/ml). \n \nIn an embryotoxicity study in rats, developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and delayed \nskeletal ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed at oral doses of \u2265 150 mg/kg/day \n(corresponding to \u2265 3 times the human estimated exposure (see above).  There were no treatment-\nrelated malformations in rats. \n \nRetapamulin was given as a continuous intravenous infusion to pregnant rabbits from day 7 to day 19 \nof gestation. Maternal toxicity was demonstrated at dosages of \u2265 7.2 mg/kg/day corresponding to \u2265 8 \ntimes the estimated human exposure (see above). There was no treatment-related effect on embryo-\nfetal development.  \n \nNo studies to evaluate effects of retapamulin on pre-/postnatal development were performed.  \nHowever, there were no systemic effects on juvenile rats with topical application of retapamulin \nointment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n6.

What Altargo is and what it is used for \n \nAltargo ointment contains an antibiotic called retapamulin, which is used on the skin. \nAltargo is used to treat bacterial infections affecting small areas of skin.  Infections that may be treated \ninclude impetigo (which causes crusting scabs on infected areas), cuts, grazes and stitched wounds.   \n \nAltargo is for adults and children aged nine months and older. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Altargo \n \nDo not use Altargo \n \nIf you are allergic to retapamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Altargo. \n \nIf you notice any worsening of the infection or develop increased redness, irritation or other signs and \nsymptoms at the site of application you should stop using Altargo and tell your doctor.  See also \nsection 4 of this leaflet. \n \nIf there is no improvement in your infection after two to three days of treatment contact your doctor. \n \nChildren \n \nAltargo should not be used on children who are less than nine months old. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n \n \nOther medicines and Altargo \n \nDo not apply other ointments, creams or lotions to the area being treated with Altargo unless \nspecifically instructed to do so by your doctor. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. If the patient is \na child less than two years old it is especially important that you tell your doctor about any other \nmedicines that the child is being given, including medicines bought without a prescription. It is \npossible that using Altargo in children who are taking certain medicines (such as some medicines used \nto treat fungal infections) could result in blood concentrations of Altargo that are higher than usual.  \nThis might lead to side effects. Your doctor will decide if Altargo can be used for a child aged less \nthan 2 years old who is taking other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  Your doctor will decide if this \ntreatment is right for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAltargo is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nAltargo contains butylated hydroxytoluene (E321)   \nIt may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation of the eyes and mucous \nmembranes. \n \n \n3. How to use Altargo \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nHow to apply Altargo \n \nA thin layer of ointment is usually put on the infected skin twice a day for five days. \nAfter applying your ointment, you may cover the treated area with a sterile bandage or gauze dressing, \nunless your doctor has told you to leave it uncovered. \nKeep using Altargo for as long as your doctor advises.   \n \nAltargo is for use on the skin only.  It must not be put in the eyes, on the mouth or lips, inside the nose \nor inside the female genital area.  If the ointment accidentally gets on to these areas, wash the area \nwith water and consult your doctor if you experience discomfort.  If you accidentally use Altargo \ninside your nose you could have a nose bleed. \n \nWash your hands before and after applying the ointment. \n \nIf you use more Altargo than you should \n \nCarefully wipe off the extra ointment. \n \nIf you forget to use Altargo \n \nApply the ointment as soon as you remember, and apply the next dose at the usual time. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n \n \nIf you accidentally swallow Altargo \n \nContact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n \nIf you stop using Altargo \n \nIf you stop using Altargo too soon, the bacteria may start to grow again and your infection may come \nback.
