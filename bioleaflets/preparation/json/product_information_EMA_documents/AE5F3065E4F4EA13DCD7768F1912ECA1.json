PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \nYellow, round tablets debossed with 893 on one side and 2½ on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone elective hip \nor knee replacement surgery. \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); age \n≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II). \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of VTE (VTEp): elective hip or knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be \ntaken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. \n \nPhysicians may consider the potential benefits of earlier anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis as well \nas the risks of post-surgical bleeding in deciding on the time of administration within this time \nwindow. \n \nIn patients undergoing hip replacement surgery \nThe recommended duration of treatment is 32 to 38 days. \n \nIn patients undergoing knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days. \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose reduction \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily in patients with NVAF and at \nleast two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine \n≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L). \n \nTherapy should be continued long-term. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg \ntaken orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available \nmedical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk \nfactors (e.g., recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). \n \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is 2.5 mg taken orally \ntwice daily. When prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose \nshould be initiated following completion of 6 months of treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily or \nwith another anticoagulant, as indicated in Table 1 below (see also section 5.1). \n \nTable 1: \n\n Dosing schedule Maximum daily dose \n\nTreatment of DVT or PE 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days  20 mg \n\nfollowed by 5 mg twice daily  10 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent DVT \nand/or PE following completion \nof 6 months of treatment for DVT \nor PE \n\n2.5 mg twice daily \n \n\n5 mg \n\n \nThe duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment \nbenefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take Eliquis immediately and then continue with twice daily \nintake as before. \n \nSwitching \nSwitching treatment from parenteral anticoagulants to Eliquis (and vice versa) can be done at the next \nscheduled dose (see section 4.5). These medicinal products should not be administered \nsimultaneously. \n \nSwitching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis \nWhen converting patients from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis, warfarin or other \nVKA therapy should be discontinued and Eliquis started when the international normalised ratio (INR) \nis < 2. \n \nSwitching from Eliquis to VKA therapy \nWhen converting patients from Eliquis to VKA therapy, administration of Eliquis should be continued \nfor at least 2 days after beginning VKA therapy. After 2 days of coadministration of Eliquis with VKA \ntherapy, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of Eliquis. Coadministration of \nEliquis and VKA therapy should be continued until the INR is ≥ 2. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, the following recommendations apply: \n \n- for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment of \nDVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), no dose adjustment is \nnecessary (see section 5.2). \n \n- for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and serum creatinine \n≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg, a dose \nreduction is necessary and described above. In the absence of other criteria for dose reduction (age, \nbody weight), no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following \nrecommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): \n \n- for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment of \nDVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) apixaban is to be used with \ncaution; \n \n-  for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should receive \n\nthe lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nEliquis is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) >2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical trials. Therefore Eliquis \nshould be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to initiating Eliquis, \nliver function testing should be performed. \n \nBody weight \nVTEp and VTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nNVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at \nthe beginning of section 4.2). \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \nVTEp and VTEt – No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nNVAF – No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction \nat the beginning of section 4.2). \n \nPatients undergoing catheter ablation (NVAF) \nPatients can continue apixaban use while undergoing catheter ablation (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nApixaban can be initiated or continued in NVAF patients who may require cardioversion.  \n \nFor patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, exclusion of left atrial thrombus using an \nimage guided approach (e.g. transesophogeal echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomographic scan \n(CT)) prior to cardioversion should be considered, in accordance with established medical guidelines. \n\nFor patients initiating treatment with apixaban, 5 mg should be given twice daily for at least 2.5 days \n(5 single doses) before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see section 5.1). The dosing \nregimen should be reduced to 2.5 mg apixaban given twice daily for at least 2.5 days (5 single doses) \nif the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see above sections Dose reduction and Renal \nimpairment). \n \nIf cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can be administered, a 10 mg loading dose \nshould be given, followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be reduced to a 5 mg \nloading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see \nabove sections Dose reduction and Renal impairment). The administration of the loading dose should \nbe given at least 2 hours before cardioversion (see section 5.1). \n \nFor all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that \nthe patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should \ntake established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing \ncardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with NVAF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) \nThere is limited experience of treatment with apixaban at the recommended dose for NVAF patients \nwhen used in combination with antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI after \nhaemostasis is achieved (see sections 4.4, 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Eliquis in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use \nEliquis should be swallowed with water, with or without food. \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in \nwater, or 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or apple juice or mixed with apple puree and immediately \nadministered orally (see section 5.2). Alternatively, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in \n60 mL of water or D5W and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube (see section 5.2).  \nCrushed Eliquis tablets are stable in water, D5W, apple juice, and apple puree for up to 4 hours. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Active clinically significant bleeding. \n Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\n\n\n6 \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular \nabnormalities. \n\n Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), \nlow molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives \n(fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under \nspecific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH \nis given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaemorrhage risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Eliquis are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Eliquis \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see sections 4.8 and 4.9). \n \nAlthough treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated \nquantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of \napixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nAn agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of Eliquis with antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs), including acetylsalicylic acid. \n \nFollowing surgery, other platelet aggregation inhibitors are not recommended concomitantly with \nEliquis (see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients with atrial fibrillation and conditions that warrant mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, a \ncareful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks should be made before \ncombining this therapy with Eliquis. \n \nIn a clinical trial of patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant use of ASA increased the major \nbleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and increased the bleeding risk on \nwarfarin from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.1%) use of \nconcomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nA clinical trial enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation with ACS and/or undergoing PCI and a planned \ntreatment period with a P2Y12 inhibitor, with or without ASA, and oral anticoagulant (either apixaban \nor VKA) for 6 months. Concomitant use of ASA increased the risk of ISTH (International Society on \nThrombosis and Hemostasis) major or CRNM (Clinically Relevant Non-Major) bleeding in apixaban-\ntreated subjects from 16.4% per year to 33.1% per year (see section 5.1). \n \nIn a clinical trial of high-risk post acute coronary syndrome patients without atrial fibrillation, \ncharacterised by multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, who received ASA or the \ncombination of ASA and clopidogrel, a significant increase in risk of ISTH major bleeding was \nreported for apixaban (5.13% per year) compared to placebo (2.04% per year). \n \nUse of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThere is very limited experience with the use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute \nischemic stroke in patients administered apixaban (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with prosthetic heart valves \nSafety and efficacy of Eliquis have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves, with or \nwithout atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the use of Eliquis is not recommended in this setting. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSurgery and invasive procedures \nEliquis should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a \nmoderate or high risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which the probability of clinically \nsignificant bleeding cannot be excluded or for which the risk of bleeding would be unacceptable. \n \nEliquis should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a \nlow risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which any bleeding that occurs is expected to be \nminimal, non-critical in its location or easily controlled. \n \nIf surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised, taking \ninto consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the \nurgency of intervention. \n \nEliquis should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as possible \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established (for cardioversion \nsee section 4.2). \n \nFor patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, Eliquis treatment does not need to be \ninterrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nTemporary discontinuation \nDiscontinuing anticoagulants, including Eliquis, for active bleeding, elective surgery, or invasive \nprocedures places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. Lapses in therapy should be avoided and \nif anticoagulation with Eliquis must be temporarily discontinued for any reason, therapy should be \nrestarted as soon as possible. \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal \ncatheters must be removed at least 5 hours prior to the first dose of Eliquis. The risk may also be \nincreased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored \nfor signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or \nbladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is \nnecessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the \nrisk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThere is no clinical experience with the use of apixaban with indwelling intrathecal or epidural \ncatheters. In case there is such need and based on the general PK characteristics of apixaban, a time \ninterval of 20-30 hours (i.e., 2 x half-life) between the last dose of apixaban and catheter withdrawal \nshould elapse, and at least one dose should be omitted before catheter withdrawal. The next dose of \napixaban may be given at least 5 hours after catheter removal. As with all new anticoagulant medicinal \nproducts, experience with neuraxial blockade is limited and extreme caution is therefore recommended \nwhen using apixaban in the presence of neuraxial blockade. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nEliquis is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations. \n \nPatients with active cancer \nEfficacy and safety of apixaban in the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE (VTEt) in patients with active cancer have not been established. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLimited clinical data indicate that apixaban plasma concentrations are increased in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nFor the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), the treatment of DVT, \ntreatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), apixaban is to be used with caution \nin patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nFor the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), and patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL \n(133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg should receive the lower \ndose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nAlso, the coadministration of Eliquis with ASA in elderly patients should be used cautiously because \nof a potentially higher bleeding risk. \n \nBody weight \nLow body weight (< 60 kg) may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nEliquis is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were \nexcluded in clinical trials. Therefore Eliquis should be used cautiously in this population (see \nsection 5.2). Prior to initiating Eliquis, liver function testing should be performed. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nInteraction with inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \nThe use of Eliquis is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nstrong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). These \nmedicinal products may increase apixaban exposure by 2-fold (see section 4.5), or greater in the \npresence of additional factors that increase apixaban exposure (e.g., severe renal impairment). \n \nInteraction with inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nThe concomitant use of Eliquis with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may lead to a ~50% reduction in apixaban exposure. \nIn a clinical study in atrial fibrillation patients, diminished efficacy and a higher risk of bleeding were \nobserved with coadministration of apixaban with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp compared \nwith using apixaban alone. \n \nIn patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nthe following recommendations apply (see section 4.5): \n \n- for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke \nand systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, \napixaban should be used with caution; \n \n- for the treatment of DVT and treatment of PE, apixaban should not be used since efficacy may be \ncompromised. \n \nHip fracture surgery \nApixaban has not been studied in clinical trials in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery to evaluate \nefficacy and safety in these patients. Therefore, it is not recommended in these patients. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting tests [e.g., prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] are \naffected as expected by the mechanism of action of apixaban. Changes observed in these clotting tests \nat the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability (see section 5.1). \n \nInformation about excipients \nEliquis contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nCoadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both \nCYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean \napixaban Cmax. \n \nThe use of Eliquis is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nstrong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nActive substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, (eg., \namiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to \nincrease apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required \nwhen coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For \nexample, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, \nled to a 1.4-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, \nsingle dose) an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold \nincrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an \n\n\n\n10 \n\ninhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean \napixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. \n \nInducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nCoadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an \napproximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant \nuse of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose \nadjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, \nhowever in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 \nand P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee \nreplacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and \nfor the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. \n \nApixaban is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant \nsystemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be \ncompromised (see section 4.4). \n \nAnticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, SSRIs/SNRIs and NSAIDs \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), \nan additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. \n \nPharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were not evident when apixaban was \ncoadministered with ASA 325 mg once a day. \n \nApixaban coadministered with clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of clopidogrel \n75 mg and ASA 162 mg once daily, or with prasugrel (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in \nPhase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of \nplatelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases \nin clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) were consistent with the effects of apixaban alone. \n \nNaproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban \nAUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No \nchanges were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and \nno clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \napixaban and naproxen. \n \nDespite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response \nwhen antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Eliquis should be used with caution when \ncoadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because these medicinal \nproducts typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4). \n \nThere is limited experience of co-administration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As \nsuch agents increase the bleeding risk, co-administration of these products with Eliquis is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapies \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \napixaban was coadministered with atenolol or famotidine. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with \natenolol 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. \nFollowing administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were \n\n\n\n11 \n\n15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with \nfamotidine 40 mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or Cmax. \n \nEffect of apixaban on other medicinal products \nIn vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 > 45 µM) and weak inhibitory effect on the activity \nof CYP2C19 (IC50 > 20 µM) at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma \nconcentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a \nconcentration up to 20 µM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of \ncoadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a \nsignificant inhibitor of P-gp. \n \nIn studies conducted in healthy subjects, as described below, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the \npharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, or atenolol. \n \nDigoxin  \nCoadministration of apixaban (20 mg once a day) and digoxin (0.25 mg once a day), a P-gp substrate, \ndid not affect digoxin AUC or Cmax. Therefore, apixaban does not inhibit P-gp mediated substrate \ntransport. \n \nNaproxen  \nCoadministration of single doses of apixaban (10 mg) and naproxen (500 mg), a commonly used \nNSAID, did not have any effect on the naproxen AUC or Cmax. \n \nAtenolol  \nCoadministration of a single dose of apixaban (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg), a common beta-blocker, \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. \n \nActivated charcoal \nAdministration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure (see section 4.9). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Apixaban is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in \nanimals have shown excretion of apixaban in milk. In rat milk, a high milk to maternal plasma ratio \n(Cmax about 8, AUC about 30) was found, possibly due to active transport into the milk. A risk to \nnewborns and infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made to either discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from apixaban \ntherapy. \n \nFertility \nStudies in animals dosed with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEliquis has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of apixaban has been investigated in 7 Phase III clinical studies including more than \n21,000 patients: more than 5,000 patients in VTEp studies, more than 11,000 patients in NVAF studies \nand more than 4,000 patients in the VTE treatment (VTEt) studies, for an average total exposure of \n20 days, 1.7 years and 221 days respectively (see section 5.1). \n \nCommon adverse reactions were haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma (see Table 2 for \nadverse reaction profile and frequencies by indication). \n \nIn the VTEp studies, in total, 11% of the patients treated with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily experienced \nadverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n10% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin studies. \n \nIn the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the \napixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, \nlower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major \nintraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year. \n \nIn the VTEt studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n15.6% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin study and 13.3% in the apixaban vs placebo study (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of system organ class and frequency using \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data) for VTEp, NVAF, and VTEt respectively. \n \nTable 2 \n\nSystem Organ Class Prevention of \nVTE in adult \npatients who \n\nhave undergone \nelective hip or \n\nknee replacement \nsurgery (VTEp) \n\nPrevention of \nstroke and \nsystemic \n\nembolism in \nadult patients \n\nwith NVAF, with \none or more risk \nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nAnaemia  Common Common Common \nThrombocytopenia  Uncommon Uncommon Common \nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity, allergic oedema and \nAnaphylaxis  \n\nRare Uncommon Uncommon \n\nPruritus Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon* \nNervous system disorders \n\nBrain haemorrhage† Not known Uncommon Rare \n\nEye disorders \n\nEye haemorrhage (including \nconjunctival haemorrhage) \n\nRare Common Uncommon \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHaemorrhage, haematoma Common Common Common \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSystem Organ Class Prevention of \nVTE in adult \npatients who \n\nhave undergone \nelective hip or \n\nknee replacement \nsurgery (VTEp) \n\nPrevention of \nstroke and \nsystemic \n\nembolism in \nadult patients \n\nwith NVAF, with \none or more risk \nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nHypotension (including procedural \nhypotension) \n\nUncommon Common Uncommon \n\nIntra-abdominal haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nEpistaxis Uncommon Common Common \nHaemoptysis Rare Uncommon Uncommon \nRespiratory tract haemorrhage  Not known Rare Rare \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea Common Common Common \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon Common Common \nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Uncommon \nMouth haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Common \nHaematochezia Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon \nRectal haemorrhage, gingival \nbleeding \n\nRare Common Common \n\nRetroperitoneal haemorrhage Not known Rare Not known \nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nLiver function test abnormal, asparate \naminotransferase increased, blood \nalkaline phosphatase increased, blood \nbilirubin increased \n\nUncommon Uncommon Uncommon \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \n\nUncommon Common Common \n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon Uncommon Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nSkin rash Not known Uncommon Common \nAlopecia Rare Uncommon Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nMuscle haemorrhage Rare Rare Uncommon \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nHaematuria Uncommon Common Common \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nAbnormal vaginal haemorrhage, \nurogenital haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Uncommon Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nApplication site bleeding Not known Uncommon Uncommon \nInvestigations \n\nOccult blood positive Not known Uncommon Uncommon \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nContusion Common Common Common \n\n\n\n14 \n\nSystem Organ Class Prevention of \nVTE in adult \npatients who \n\nhave undergone \nelective hip or \n\nknee replacement \nsurgery (VTEp) \n\nPrevention of \nstroke and \nsystemic \n\nembolism in \nadult patients \n\nwith NVAF, with \none or more risk \nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nPost procedural haemorrhage \n(including post procedural \nhaematoma, wound haemorrhage, \nvessel puncture site haematoma and \ncatheter site haemorrhage), wound \nsecretion, incision site haemorrhage \n(including incision site haematoma), \noperative haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Uncommon Uncommon \n\nTraumatic haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Uncommon \n* There were no occurrences of generalized pruritus in CV185057 (long term prevention of VTE)  \n†\n The term “Brain haemorrhage” encompasses all intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhages (ie., haemorrhagic stroke or \n\nputamen, cerebellar, intraventricular, or subdural haemorrhages). \n \nThe use of Eliquis may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue \nor organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose of apixaban may result in a higher risk of bleeding. In the event of haemorrhagic \ncomplications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated. The initiation \nof appropriate treatment, e.g., surgical haemostasis, the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or the \nadministration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors should be considered. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, orally-administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily \nfor 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily (bid) for 7 days or 50 mg once daily (od) for 3 days) had no \nclinically relevant adverse effects. \n \nIn healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20 mg dose \nof apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively, and had no impact on Cmax. \nMean half-life of apixaban decreased from 13.4 hours when apixaban was administered alone to \n5.3 hours and 4.9 hours, respectively, when activated charcoal was administered 2 and 6 hours after \napixaban. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban \noverdose or accidental ingestion. \n \nFor situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled \nbleeding, a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors is available (see section 4.4). Administration of \nprothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered. \nReversal of Eliquis pharmacodynamic effects, as demonstrated by changes in the thrombin generation \nassay, was evident at the end of infusion and reached baseline values within 4 hours after the start of a \n4-factor PCC 30 minute infusion in healthy subjects. However, there is no clinical experience with the \nuse of 4-factor PCC products to reverse bleeding in individuals who have received Eliquis. Currently \n\n\n\n15 \n\nthere is no experience with the use of recombinant factor VIIa in individuals receiving apixaban. Re-\ndosing of recombinant factor VIIa could be considered and titrated depending on improvement of \nbleeding. \n \nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings. \n \nHaemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), \nwhen a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF02 \n \nMechanism of action \nApixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa. It \ndoes not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound \nfactor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but \nindirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban \nprevents thrombin generation and thrombus development. Preclinical studies of apixaban in animal \nmodels have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis \nat doses that preserved haemostasis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban are reflective of the mechanism of action (FXa inhibition). \nAs a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR and \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected \ntherapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability. They are not recommended to \nassess the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban. In the thrombin generation assay, apixaban reduced \nendogenous thrombin potential, a measure of thrombin generation in human plasma. \n \nApixaban also demonstrates anti-FXa activity as evident by reduction in Factor Xa enzyme activity in \nmultiple commercial anti-FXa kits, however results differ across kits. Data from clinical trials are only \navailable for the Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay. Anti-FXa activity exhibits a close direct \nlinear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, reaching maximum values at the time of \napixaban peak plasma concentrations. The relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and \nanti-FXa activity is approximately linear over a wide dose range of apixaban. \n \nTable 3 below shows the predicted steady state exposure and anti-Factor Xa activity for each \nindication. In patients taking apixaban for the prevention of VTE following hip or knee replacement \nsurgery, the results demonstrate a less than 1.6-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels. In \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism, the results demonstrate a less than 1.7-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels.

A \ntotal of 8,464 patients were randomised in two pivotal, double-blind, multi-national studies, comparing \napixaban 2.5 mg given orally twice daily (4,236 patients) or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily \n(4,228 patients). Included in this total were 1,262 patients (618 in the apixaban group) of age 75 or \nolder, 1,004 patients (499 in the apixaban group) with low body weight (≤ 60 kg), 1,495 patients \n(743 in the apixaban group) with BMI ≥ 33 kg/m2, and 415 patients (203 in the apixaban group) with \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nThe ADVANCE-3 study included 5,407 patients undergoing elective hip replacement, and the \nADVANCE-2 study included 3,057 patients undergoing elective knee replacement. Subjects received \neither apixaban 2.5 mg given orally twice daily (po bid) or enoxaparin 40 mg administered \nsubcutaneously once daily (sc od). The first dose of apixaban was given 12 to 24 hours post-surgery, \nwhereas enoxaparin was started 9 to 15 hours prior to surgery. Both apixaban and enoxaparin were \ngiven for 32-38 days in the ADVANCE-3 study and for 10-14 days in the ADVANCE-2 study. \n \nBased on patient medical history in the studied population of ADVANCE-3 and ADVANCE-2 \n(8,464 patients), 46% had hypertension, 10% had hyperlipidemia, 9% had diabetes, and 8% had \ncoronary artery disease. \n \nApixaban demonstrated a statistically superior reduction in the primary endpoint, a composite of all \nVTE/all cause death, and in the Major VTE endpoint, a composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and \nVTE-related death, compared to enoxaparin in both elective hip or knee replacement surgery (see \nTable 4). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy Results from Pivotal Phase III Studies \nStudy ADVANCE-3 (hip) ADVANCE-2 (knee) \nStudy treatment \nDose \nDuration of treatment  \n\nApixaban \n2.5 mg po \ntwice daily \n\n35 ± 3 d \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg sc \n\nonce daily \n35 ± 3 d \n\np-value Apixaban \n2.5 mg po \ntwice daily \n\n12 ± 2 d \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg sc \n\nonce daily \n12 ± 2 d \n\np-value \n\nTotal VTE/all-cause death \nNumber of \nevents/subjects \nEvent Rate \n\n27/1,949 \n1.39% \n\n74/1,917 \n3.86% \n\n< 0.000\n1 \n\n147/976 \n15.06% \n\n243/997 \n24.37% \n\n<0.0001 \nRelative Risk \n95% CI \n\n0.36 \n(0.22, 0.54) \n\n 0.62 \n(0.51, 0.74) \n\n \n\nMajor VTE \nNumber of \nevents/subjects \nEvent Rate \n\n10/2,199 \n0.45% \n\n25/2,195 \n1.14% \n\n0.0107 \n\n13/1,195 \n1.09% \n\n26/1,199 \n2.17% \n\n0.0373 \nRelative Risk \n95% CI \n\n0.40 \n(0.15, 0.80) \n\n 0.50 \n(0.26, 0.97) \n\n \n\n \nThe safety endpoints of major bleeding, the composite of major and CRNM bleeding, and all bleeding \nshowed similar rates for patients treated with apixaban 2.5 mg compared with enoxaparin 40 mg (see \nTable 5).

The program \nwas designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and one or more additional \nrisk factors, such as:  \n prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \n age ≥ 75 years \n hypertension \n diabetes mellitus \n symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II) \n\n \nARISTOTLE STUDY \nIn the ARISTOTLE study a total of 18,201 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with \napixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%], see section 4.2) or \nwarfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), patients were exposed to study drug for a mean of 20 months. The \nmean age was 69.1 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1 and 18.9% of patients had prior stroke or \nTIA. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) and systemic embolism (see Table 6) compared with \nwarfarin. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy Outcomes in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE Study \n\n Apixaban  \nN=9,120 \nn (%/yr) \n\nWarfarin  \nN=9,081 \nn (%/yr) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n \np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism 212 (1.27) 265 (1.60) 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) 0.0114 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or unspecified 162 (0.97) 175 (1.05) 0.92 (0.74, 1.13)  \nHaemorrhagic 40 (0.24) 78 (0.47) 0.51 (0.35, 0.75)  \n\nSystemic embolism 15 (0.09) 17 (0.10) 0.87 (0.44, 1.75)  \n \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) \n(INR 2-3) was 66%. \n \nApixaban showed a reduction of stroke and systemic embolism compared to warfarin across the \ndifferent levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio \nfor apixaban vs warfarin was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.38, 1.40). \n \nKey secondary endpoints of major bleeding and all cause death were tested in a pre-specified \nhierarchical testing strategy to control the overall type 1 error in the trial. Statistically significant \nsuperiority was also achieved in the key secondary endpoints of both major bleeding and all-cause \ndeath (see Table 7). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of apixaban compared to \nwarfarin regarding all cause death diminish. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTable 7: Secondary Endpoints in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE Study \n Apixaban \n\nN = 9,088 \nn (%/year) \n\nWarfarin \nN = 9,052 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n\nBleeding Outcomes \nMajor* 327 (2.13) 462 (3.09) 0.69 (0.60, 0.80) < 0.0001 \n\nFatal 10 (0.06) 37 (0.24)   \nIntracranial 52 (0.33) 122 (0.80)   \n\nMajor + CRNM 613 (4.07) 877 (6.01) 0.68 (0.61, 0.75) < 0.0001 \nAll 2356 (18.1) 3060 (25.8) 0.71 (0.68, 0.75) < 0.0001 \n\nOther Endpoints \n\nAll-cause death 603 (3.52) 669 (3.94) 0.89 (0.80, 1.00) 0.0465 \n\nMyocardial \ninfarction \n\n90 (0.53)  102 (0.61) 0.88 (0.66, 1.17)  \n\n* Major bleeding defined per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. \n \nThe overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.8% for apixaban and 2.6% for warfarin \nin the ARISTOTLE study. \n \nThe efficacy results for prespecified subgroups, including CHADS2 score, age, body weight, gender, \nstatus of renal function, prior stroke or TIA and diabetes were consistent with the primary efficacy \nresults for the overall population studied in the trial. \n \nThe incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, lower GI, and rectal \nbleeding) was 0.76%/year with apixaban and 0.86%/year with warfarin. \n \nThe major bleeding results for prespecified subgroups including CHADS2 score, age, body weight, \ngender, status of renal function, prior stroke or TIA and diabetes were consistent with the results for \nthe overall population studied in the trial. \n \nAVERROES STUDY \nIn the AVERROES study a total of 5,598 patients considered to be unsuitable for VKA by the \ninvestigators were randomised to treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in \nselected patients [6.4%], see section 4.2) or ASA. ASA was given at a once daily dose of 81 mg \n(64%), 162 (26.9%), 243 (2.1%), or 324 mg (6.6%) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients were \nexposed to study drug for a mean of 14 months. The mean age was 69.9 years, the mean CHADS2 \nscore was 2.0 and 13.6% of patients had prior stroke or TIA. \n \nCommon reasons for unsuitability for VKA therapy in the AVERROES study included \nunable/unlikely to obtain INRs at requested intervals (42.6%), patient refused treatment with VKA \n(37.4%), CHADS2 score = 1 and physician did not recommend VKA (21.3%), patient could not be \nrelied on to adhere to VKA medicinal product instruction (15.0%), and difficulty/expected difficulty in \ncontacting patient in case of urgent dose change (11.7%). \n \nAVERROES was stopped early based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring \nCommittee due to clear evidence of reduction of stroke and systemic embolism with an acceptable \nsafety profile. \n \nThe overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.5% for apixaban and 1.3% for ASA in \nthe AVERROES study. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic, ischaemic or unspecified) or systemic embolism (see Table 8) \ncompared to ASA. \n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 8: Key Efficacy Outcomes in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the AVERROES Study \n\n Apixaban \nN = 2,807  \n\nn (%/year) \n\nASA  \nN = 2,791 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard Ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n \n\np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism* 51 (1.62) 113 (3.63) 0.45 (0.32, 0.62) < 0.0001 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or \nunspecified \n\n43 (1.37) 97 (3.11) 0.44 (0.31, 0.63)  \n\nHaemorrhagic 6 (0.19) 9 (0.28) 0.67 (0.24, 1.88)      \nSystemic embolism 2 (0.06) 13 (0.41) 0.15 (0.03, 0.68)  \n\nStroke, systemic embolism, \nMI, or vascular death*† \n\n132 (4.21) 197 (6.35) 0.66 (0.53, 0.83) 0.003 \n\nMyocardial infarction 24 (0.76) 28 (0.89) 0.86 (0.50, 1.48)  \nVascular Death 84 (2.65) 96 (3.03) 0.87 (0.65, 1.17)  \n\nAll-cause death† 111 (3.51) 140 (4.42) 0.79 (0.62, 1.02) 0.068 \n* Assessed by sequential testing strategy designed to control the overall type I error in the trial. \n† Secondary endpoint. \n \nThere was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding between apixaban \nand ASA (see Table 9). \n \nTable 9: Bleeding Events in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the AVERROES Study \n\n Apixaban \nN = 2,798 \nn(%/year) \n\nASA \nN = 2,780 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95%CI) \n\np-value \n\nMajor* 45 (1.41) 29 (0.92) 1.54 (0.96, 2.45)  0.0716 \nFatal, n 5 (0.16) 5 (0.16)   \nIntracranial, n 11 (0.34) 11 (0.35)   \n\nMajor + CRNM† 140 (4.46) 101 (3.24) 1.38 (1.07, 1.78) 0.0144 \nAll 325 (10.85) 250 (8.32) 1.30 (1.10, 1.53) 0.0017 \n\n*Major bleeding defined per International Society on Thrombosis ad Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. \n† Clinically Relevant Non-Major \n \nNVAF patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI \nAUGUSTUS, an open-label, randomized, controlled, 2 by 2 factorial design trial, enrolled \n4614 patients with NVAF who had ACS (43%) and/or underwent PCI (56%). All patients received \nbackground therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel: 90.3%) prescribed per local standard of care. \n \nPatients were randomized up to 14 days after the ACS and/or PCI to either apixaban 5 mg twice daily \n(2.5 mg twice daily if two or more of the dose-reduction criteria were met; 10% received lower dose) \nor VKA and to either ASA (81 mg once daily) or placebo. The mean age was 69.9 years, 94% of \npatients randomized had a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, and 47% had a HAS-BLED score > 3. For \npatients randomised to VKA, the proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was 56%, \nwith 32% of time below TTR and 12% above TTR. \n \nThe primary objective of AUGUSTUS was to assess safety, with a primary endpoint of ISTH major or \nCRNM bleeding. In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major \nor CRNM bleeding at month 6 occurred in 241 (10.5%), and 332 (14.7%) patients in the apixaban arm \nand in the VKA arm respectively (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; 2-sided p<0.0001 for non inferiority \nand p<0.0001 for superiority). For VKA, additional analyses using subgroups by TTR showed that the \nhighest rate of bleeding was associated with the lowest quartile of TTR. The rate of bleeding was \nsimilar between apixaban and the highest quartile of TTR. \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major or CRNM \nbleeding at month 6 occurred in 367 (16.1%), and 204 (9.0%) patients in the ASA arm and in the \nplacebo arm respectively (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.23; two-sided p<0.0001). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nSpecifically, in apixaban-treated patients, major or CRNM bleeding occurred in 157 (13.7%), and 84 \n(7.4%) patients in the ASA arm and in the placebo arm respectively. In VKA-treated patients, major or \nCRNM bleeding occurred in 208 (18.5%), and 122 (10.8%) patients in the ASA arm and in the \nplacebo arm respectively. \n \nOther treatment effects were evaluated as a secondary objective of the study, with composite \nendpoints. \nIn the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization \noccured in 541 (23.5%) and 632 (27.4%) patients in the apixaban and in the VKA arm, respectively. \nThe composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or \nurgent revascularization) occured in 170 (7.4%), and 182 (7.9%) patients in the apixaban and in the \nVKA arm, respectively. \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization occurred \nin 604 (26.2%) and 569 (24.7%) patients in the ASA and in the placebo arm, respectively. The \ncomposite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or \nurgent revascularization) occured in 163 (7.1%), and 189 (8.2%) patients in the ASA and in the \nplacebo arm, respectively. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nEMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 patients who were either oral \nanticoagulant naïve or pre-treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion for NVAF. \nPatients were randomized 1:1 to apixaban or to heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of \ncardiovascular events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was conducted after at least 5 \ndoses of 5 mg twice daily apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients (see section 4.2)) or at \nleast 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading dose in selected patients (see section 4.2)) \nif earlier cardioversion was required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a loading dose (331 \npatients received the 10 mg dose and 11 patients received the 5 mg dose). \n \nThere were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n= 753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin \nand/or VKA group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All-cause death occurred in 2 patients \n(0.27%) in the apixaban group and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No systemic \nembolism events were reported. \n \nMajor bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 (0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, \nrespectively, in the apixaban group, compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) patients in the heparin \nand/or VKA group. \n \nThis exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety between apixaban and heparin and/or \nVKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe clinical program (AMPLIFY: apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin, AMPLIFY-EXT: apixaban \nversus placebo) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the treatment of \nDVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY), and extended therapy for the prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE \nfollowing 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment for DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Both \nstudies were randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, multinational trials in patients with \nsymptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. All the key safety and efficacy endpoints were \nadjudicated by an independent blinded committee. \n \nAMPLIFY STUDY  \nIn the AMPLIFY study a total of 5,395 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 10 mg \ntwice daily orally for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin \n1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR≥ 2) and warfarin (target INR range \n2.0-3.0) orally for 6 months. \n \nThe mean age was 56.9 years and 89.8% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) \nwas 60.9. Apixaban showed a reduction in recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE- related death across \nthe different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the relative \nrisk for apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 1.61). \n \nIn the study, apixaban was shown to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the combined primary \nendpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related \ndeath (see Table 10). \n \nTable 10: Efficacy Results in the AMPLIFY Study \n\n Apixaban \n\nN=2,609 \n\nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin/Warfar\nin \n\nN=2,635 \n\nn (%) \n\nRelative Risk \n\n(95% CI) \n\nVTE or VTE-related \ndeath \n\n59 (2.3) 71 (2.7) 0.84 (0.60, 1.18)* \n\n DVT 20 (0.7) 33 (1.2)  \n\n PE 27 (1.0) 23 (0.9)  \n\n VTE-related \n death \n\n12 (0.4) 15 (0.6)  \n\nVTE or all-cause \ndeath \n\n84 (3.2) 104 (4.0) 0.82 (0.61, 1.08) \n\nVTE or CV-related \ndeath \n\n61 (2.3) 77 (2.9) 0.80 (0.57, 1.11) \n\nVTE, VTE-related \ndeath, or major \nbleeding \n\n73 (2.8) 118 (4.5) 0.62 (0.47, 0.83) \n\n* Noninferior compared to enoxaparin/warfarin (p-value <0.0001) \n \nApixaban efficacy in initial treatment of VTE was consistent between patients who were treated for a \nPE [Relative Risk 0.9; 95% CI (0.5, 1.6)] or DVT [Relative Risk 0.8; 95% CI (0.5, 1.3)].

Apixaban is \nrapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 3 to 4 hours after tablet intake. Intake \nwith food does not affect apixaban AUC or Cmax at the 10 mg dose. Apixaban can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \nApixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposure for oral \ndoses up to 10 mg. At doses ≥ 25 mg apixaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability. Apixaban exposure parameters exhibit low to moderate variability reflected by a \nwithin-subject and inter-subject variability of ~20% CV and ~30% CV, respectively. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of \nwater, exposure was comparable to exposure after oral administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets with 30 g of apple \npuree, the Cmax and AUC were 21% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of \n2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in exposure is not considered clinically relevant. \n \nFollowing administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet suspended in 60 mL of D5W and \ndelivered via a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to exposure seen in other clinical trials \ninvolving healthy subjects receiving a single oral 5 mg apixaban tablet dose. \n \nGiven the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban, the bioavailability \nresults from the conducted studies are applicable to lower apixaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is \napproximately 21 litres. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nApixaban has multiple routes of elimination. Of the administered apixaban dose in humans, \napproximately 25% was recovered as metabolites, with the majority recovered in faeces. Renal \nexcretion of apixaban accounts for approximately 27% of total clearance. Additional contributions \nfrom biliary and direct intestinal excretion were observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, \nrespectively. \n \nApixaban has a total clearance of about 3.3 L/h and a half-life of approximately 12 hours. \n \nO-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Apixaban is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from \nCYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in \nhuman plasma with no active circulating metabolites present. Apixaban is a substrate of transport \nproteins, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was no impact of impaired renal function on peak concentration of apixaban. There was an \nincrease in apixaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via measured \ncreatinine clearance. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min), moderate \n(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) renal \nimpairment, apixaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 16, 29, and 44% respectively, \ncompared to individuals with normal creatinine clearance. Renal impairment had no evident effect on \nthe relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-FXa activity. \n \nIn subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the AUC of apixaban was increased by 36% when a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered immediately after haemodialysis, compared to that \nseen in subjects with normal renal function. Haemodialysis, started two hours after administration of a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg, decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in these ESRD subjects, \ncorresponding to an apixaban dialysis clearance of 18 mL/min. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh A score 5 (n = 6) and \nscore 6 (n = 2), and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh B score 7 (n = 6) and \nscore 8 (n = 2), to 16 healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of apixaban 5 mg were not altered in subjects with hepatic impairment. Changes in \nanti-Factor Xa activity and INR were comparable between subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment and healthy subjects. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (above 65 years) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with \nmean AUC values being approximately 32% higher and no difference in Cmax. \n \nGender \nExposure to apixaban was approximately 18% higher in females than in males. \n \nEthnic origin and race \nThe results across phase I studies showed no discernible difference in apixaban pharmacokinetics \nbetween White/Caucasian, Asian and Black/African American subjects. Findings from a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients who received apixaban were generally consistent with the phase I \nresults. \n \nBody weight \nCompared to apixaban exposure in subjects with body weight of 65 to 85 kg, body weight > 120 kg \nwas associated with approximately 30% lower exposure and body weight < 50 kg was associated with \napproximately 30% higher exposure.  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (anti-FXa activity, INR, PT, aPTT) has been evaluated after \nadministration of a wide range of doses (0.5 – 50 mg). The relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and anti-Factor Xa activity was best described by a linear model. The PK/PD \nrelationship observed in patients was consistent with that established in healthy subjects. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal \ndevelopment and juvenile toxicity. \n \nThe major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the \npharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to \nno increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of \nthe non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when \nextrapolating to humans. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); \nage≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II). \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. \n \nDose reduction \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily in patients with NVAF and at \nleast two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine \n≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L). \n \nTherapy should be continued long-term. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg \ntaken orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available \nmedical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk \nfactors (e.g., recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). \n \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is 2.5 mg taken orally \ntwice daily. When prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose \nshould be initiated following completion of 6 months of treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily or \nwith another anticoagulant, as indicated in Table 1 below (see also section 5.1) \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTable 1: \n Dosing schedule Maximum daily dose \n\nTreatment of DVT or PE  10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days  \n \n\n20 mg \n\nfollowed by 5 mg twice daily  10 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent DVT \nand/or PE following completion \nof 6 months of treatment for DVT \nor PE \n\n2.5 mg twice daily \n \n\n5 mg \n\n \nThe duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment \nbenefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take Eliquis immediately and then continue with twice daily \nintake as before. \n \nSwitching \nSwitching treatment from parenteral anticoagulants to Eliquis (and vice versa) can be done at the next \nscheduled dose (see section 4.5). These medicinal products should not be administered \nsimultaneously. \n \nSwitching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis \nWhen converting patients from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Eliquis, warfarin or other \nVKA therapy should be discontinued and Eliquis started when the international normalised ratio (INR) \nis < 2. \n \nSwitching from Eliquis to VKA therapy \nWhen converting patients from Eliquis to VKA therapy, administration of Eliquis should be continued \nfor at least 2 days after beginning VKA therapy. After 2 days of coadministration of Eliquis with VKA \ntherapy, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of Eliquis. Coadministration of \nEliquis and VKA therapy should be continued until the INR is ≥ 2. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, the following recommendations apply: \n \n- for the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), no dose \nadjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n- for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and serum creatinine ≥1.5 \nmg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥80 years or body weight ≤60 kg, a dose reduction is \nnecessary and described above. In the absence of other criteria for dose reduction (age, body weight), \nno dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following \nrecommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): \n \n-  for the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \n\napixaban is to be used with caution; \n \n-  for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should receive \n\nthe lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nEliquis is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) >2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical trials. Therefore Eliquis \nshould be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to initiating Eliquis, \nliver function testing should be performed. \n \nBody weight \nVTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at \nthe beginning of section 4.2). \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \nVTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at \nthe beginning of section 4.2). \n \nPatients undergoing catheter ablation (NVAF) \nPatients can continue apixaban use while undergoing catheter ablation (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion  \nApixaban can be initiated or continued in NVAF patients who may require cardioversion.  \n \nFor patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, exclusion of left atrial thrombus using an \nimage guided approach (e.g. transesophogeal echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomographic scan \n(CT)) prior to cardioversion should be considered, in accordance with established medical guidelines. \n\nFor patients initiating treatment with apixaban, 5 mg should be given twice daily for at least 2.5 days \n(5 single doses) before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see section 5.1). The dosing \nregimen should be reduced to 2.5 mg apixaban given twice daily for at least 2.5 days (5 single doses) \nif the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see above sections Dose reduction and Renal \nimpairment). \n \nIf cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can be administered, a 10 mg loading dose \nshould be given, followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be reduced to a 5 mg \nloading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see \nabove sections Dose reduction and Renal impairment). The administration of the loading dose should \nbe given at least 2 hours before cardioversion (see section 5.1). \n \nFor all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that \nthe patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should \ntake established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing \ncardioversion into account. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPatients with NVAF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) \nThere is limited experience of treatment with apixaban at the recommended dose for NVAF patients \nwhen used in combination with antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI after \nhaemostasis is achieved (see sections 4.4, 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Eliquis in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use \nEliquis should be swallowed with water, with or without food. \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in \nwater, or 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or apple juice or mixed with apple puree and immediately \nadministered orally (see section 5.2). Alternatively, Eliquis tablets may be crushed and suspended in \n60 mL of water or D5W and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube (see section 5.2).  \nCrushed Eliquis tablets are stable in water, D5W, apple juice, and apple puree for up to 4 hours. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Active clinically significant bleeding. \n Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular \nabnormalities. \n\n Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), \nlow molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives \n(fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under \nspecific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH \nis given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaemorrhage risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Eliquis are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Eliquis \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see sections 4.8 and 4.9). \n \nAlthough treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated \nquantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of \napixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nAn agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nThe concomitant use of Eliquis with antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs), including acetylsalicylic acid. \n \nFollowing surgery, other platelet aggregation inhibitors are not recommended concomitantly with \nEliquis (see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients with atrial fibrillation and conditions that warrant mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, a \ncareful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks should be made before \ncombining this therapy with Eliquis. \n \nIn a clinical trial of patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant use of ASA increased the major \nbleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and increased the bleeding risk on \nwarfarin from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.1%) use of \nconcomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nA clinical trial enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation with ACS and/or undergoing PCI and a planned \ntreatment period with a P2Y12 inhibitor, with or without ASA, and oral anticoagulant (either apixaban \nor VKA) for 6 months. Concomitant use of ASA increased the risk of ISTH (International Society on \nThrombosis and Hemostasis) major or CRNM (Clinically Relevant Non-Major) bleeding in apixaban-\ntreated subjects from 16.4% per year to 33.1% per year (see section 5.1). \n \nIn a clinical trial of high-risk post acute coronary syndrome patients without atrial fibrillation, \ncharacterised by multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, who received ASA or the \ncombination of ASA and clopidogrel, a significant increase in risk of ISTH major bleeding was \nreported for apixaban (5.13% per year) compared to placebo (2.04% per year). \n \nUse of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke \nThere is very limited experience with the use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute \nischemic stroke in patients administered apixaban (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with prosthetic heart valves \nSafety and efficacy of Eliquis have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves, with or \nwithout atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the use of Eliquis is not recommended in this setting. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSurgery and invasive procedures \nEliquis should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a \nmoderate or high risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which the probability of clinically \nsignificant bleeding cannot be excluded or for which the risk of bleeding would be unacceptable. \n \nEliquis should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a \nlow risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which any bleeding that occurs is expected to be \nminimal, non-critical in its location or easily controlled. \n \nIf surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised, taking \ninto consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the \nurgency of intervention. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nEliquis should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as possible \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established (for cardioversion \nsee section 4.2). \n \nFor patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, Eliquis treatment does not need to be \ninterrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nTemporary discontinuation \nDiscontinuing anticoagulants, including Eliquis, for active bleeding, elective surgery, or invasive \nprocedures places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. Lapses in therapy should be avoided and \nif anticoagulation with Eliquis must be temporarily discontinued for any reason, therapy should be \nrestarted as soon as possible. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nEliquis is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nPatients with active cancer \nEfficacy and safety of apixaban in the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE (VTEt) in patients with active cancer have not been established. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLimited clinical data indicate that apixaban plasma concentrations are increased in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nFor the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), apixaban \nis to be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n15-29 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nFor the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), and patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL \n(133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg should receive the lower \ndose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2); \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \nAlso, the co-administration of Eliquis with ASA in elderly patients should be used cautiously because \nof a potentially higher bleeding risk. \n \nBody weight \nLow body weight (< 60 kg) may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nEliquis is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were \nexcluded in clinical trials. Therefore Eliquis should be used cautiously in this population (see \nsection 5.2). Prior to initiating Eliquis, liver function testing should be performed. \n \nInteraction with inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \nThe use of Eliquis is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nstrong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). These \nmedicinal products may increase apixaban exposure by 2-fold (see section 4.5) or greater in the \npresence of additional factors that increase apixaban exposure (e.g., severe renal impairment). \n \nInteraction with inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nThe concomitant use of Eliquis with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may lead to a ~50% reduction in apixaban exposure. \nIn a clinical study in atrial fibrillation patients, diminished efficacy and a higher risk of bleeding were \nobserved with coadministration of apixaban with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp compared \nwith using apixaban alone. \n \nIn patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nthe following recommendations apply (see section 4.5): \n \n- for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE, apixaban should be used with caution; \n \n- for the treatment of DVT and treatment of PE, apixaban should not be used since efficacy may be \ncompromised. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting tests [e.g., prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] are \naffected as expected by the mechanism of action of apixaban. Changes observed in these clotting tests \nat the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability (see section 5.1). \n \nInformation about excipients \nEliquis contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nCoadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both \nCYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean \napixaban Cmax. \n \nThe use of Eliquis is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nstrong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nActive substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, (eg., \namiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to \nincrease apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required \nwhen coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For \nexample, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, \nled to a 1.4-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, \nsingle dose) an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold \nincrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an \n\n\n\n35 \n\ninhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean \napixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. \n \nInducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp  \nCoadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an \napproximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant \nuse of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose \nadjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, \nhowever in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 \nand P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in \npatients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Apixaban is not recommended \nfor the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong \ninducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be compromised (see section 4.4). \n \nAnticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, SSRIs/SNRIs and NSAIDs \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), \nan additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. \n \nPharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were not evident when apixaban was \ncoadministered with ASA 325 mg once a day. \n \nApixaban coadministered with clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of clopidogrel \n75 mg and ASA 162 mg once daily, or with prasugrel (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in \nPhase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of \nplatelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases \nin clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) were consistent with the effects of apixaban alone. \n \nNaproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban \nAUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No \nchanges were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and \nno clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \napixaban and naproxen. \n \nDespite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response \nwhen antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Eliquis should be used with caution when \ncoadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because these medicinal \nproducts typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4). \n \nThere is limited experience of co-administration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As \nsuch agents increase the bleeding risk, co-administration of these products with Eliquis is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapies \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \napixaban was coadministered with atenolol or famotidine. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with \natenolol 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. \nFollowing administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were \n15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with \nfamotidine 40 mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or Cmax. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nEffect of apixaban on other medicinal products \nIn vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 > 45 µM) and weak inhibitory effect on the activity \nof CYP2C19 (IC50 > 20 µM) at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma \nconcentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a \nconcentration up to 20 µM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of \ncoadministered drugs that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of \nP-gp. \n \nIn studies conducted in healthy subjects, as described below, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the \npharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, or atenolol. \n \nDigoxin  \nCoadministration of apixaban (20 mg once a day) and digoxin (0.25 mg once a day), a P-gp substrate, \ndid not affect digoxin AUC or Cmax. Therefore, apixaban does not inhibit P-gp mediated substrate \ntransport. \n \nNaproxen  \nCoadministration of single doses of apixaban (10 mg) and naproxen (500 mg), a commonly used \nNSAID, did not have any effect on the naproxen AUC or Cmax. \n \nAtenolol  \nCoadministration of a single dose of apixaban (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg), a common beta-blocker, \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. \n \nActivated charcoal \nAdministration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure (see section 4.9). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Apixaban is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in \nanimals have shown excretion of apixaban in milk. In rat milk, a high milk to maternal plasma ratio \n(Cmax about 8, AUC about 30) was found, possibly due to active transport into the milk. A risk to \nnewborns and infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made to either discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from apixaban \ntherapy. \n \nFertility \nStudies in animals dosed with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEliquis has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of apixaban has been investigated in 4 Phase III clinical studies including more than \n15,000 patients: more than 11,000 patients in NVAF studies and more than 4,000 patients in the VTE \n\n\n\n37 \n\ntreatment (VTEt) studies, for an average total exposure of 1.7 years and 221 days respectively \n(see section 5.1). \n \nCommon adverse reactions were haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma (see Table 2 for \nadverse reaction profile and frequencies by indication). \n \nIn the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the \napixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, \nlower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major \nintraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year. \n \nIn the VTEt studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n15.6% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin study and 13.3% in the apixaban vs placebo study \n(see section 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of system organ class and frequency using \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10) common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data) for NVAF and VTEt respectively. \n \nTable 2 \n\nSystem Organ Class Prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in adult patients with \nNVAF, with one or more risk \n\nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nAnaemia Common Common \nThrombocytopenia Uncommon Common \nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity, allergic oedema and \nAnaphylaxis  \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nPruritus Uncommon Uncommon* \nNervous system disorders \n\nBrain haemorrhage† Uncommon Rare \n\nEye disorders \n\nEye haemorrhage (including \nconjunctival haemorrhage) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHaemorrhage, haematoma Common Common \nHypotension (including procedural \nhypotension) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nIntra-abdominal haemorrhage Uncommon Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nEpistaxis Common Common \nHaemoptysis Uncommon Uncommon \nRespiratory tract haemorrhage  Rare Rare \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea Common Common \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage  Common Common \nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Uncommon Uncommon \n\n\n\n38 \n\nSystem Organ Class Prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in adult patients with \nNVAF, with one or more risk \n\nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nMouth haemorrhage Uncommon Common \nHaematochezia Uncommon Uncommon \nRectal haemorrhage, gingival bleeding Common Common \nRetroperitoneal haemorrhage Rare Not known \nHepatobiliary disorders  \nLiver function test abnormal, aspartate \naminotransferase increased, blood \nalkaline phosphatase increased, blood \nbilirubin increased \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase increased Common Common \nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nSkin rash Uncommon Common \nAlopecia Uncommon Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMuscle haemorrhage Rare Uncommon \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nHaematuria Common Common \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nAbnormal vaginal haemorrhage, \nurogenital haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nApplication site bleeding Uncommon Uncommon \nInvestigations \n\nOccult blood positive Uncommon Uncommon \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nContusion Common Common \n\nPost procedural haemorrhage \n(including post procedural \nhaematoma, wound haemorrhage, \nvessel puncture site haematoma and \ncatheter site haemorrhage), wound \nsecretion, incision site haemorrhage \n(including incision site haematoma), \noperative haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon Uncommon \n* There were no occurrences of generalized pruritus in CV185057 (long term prevention of VTE)  \n†\n The term “Brain haemorrhage” encompasses all intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhages (ie., haemorrhagic stroke or \n\nputamen, cerebellar, intraventricular, or subdural haemorrhages). \n \nThe use of Eliquis may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue \nor organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n39 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose of apixaban may result in a higher risk of bleeding. In the event of haemorrhagic \ncomplications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated. The initiation \nof appropriate treatment, e.g., surgical haemostasis, the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or the \nadministration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors should be considered. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, orally-administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily \nfor 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily (bid) for 7 days or 50 mg once daily (od) for 3 days) had no \nclinically relevant adverse effects. \n \nIn healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20 mg dose \nof apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively, and had no impact on Cmax. \nMean half-life of apixaban decreased from 13.4 hours when apixaban was administered alone to \n5.3 hours and 4.9 hours, respectively, when activated charcoal was administered 2 and 6 hours after \napixaban. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban \noverdose or accidental ingestion. \n \nFor situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled \nbleeding, a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors is available (see section 4.4). Administration of \nprothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered. \nReversal of Eliquis pharmacodynamic effects, as demonstrated by changes in the thrombin generation \nassay, was evident at the end of infusion and reached baseline values within 4 hours after the start of a \n4-factor PCC 30 minute infusion in healthy subjects. However, there is no clinical experience with the \nuse of 4-factor PCC products to reverse bleeding in individuals who have received Eliquis. Currently \nthere is no experience with the use of recombinant factor VIIa in individuals receiving apixaban. Re-\ndosing of recombinant factor VIIa could be considered and titrated depending on improvement of \nbleeding. \n \nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings. \n \nHaemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), \nwhen a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF02 \n \nMechanism of action \nApixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa. It \ndoes not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound \nfactor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but \nindirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban \nprevents thrombin generation and thrombus development. Preclinical studies of apixaban in animal \nmodels have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis \nat doses that preserved haemostasis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n\n\n40 \n\nThe pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban are reflective of the mechanism of action (FXa inhibition). \nAs a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR and \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected \ntherapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability. They are not recommended to \nassess the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban. In the thrombin generation assay, apixaban reduced \nendogenous thrombin potential, a measure of thrombin generation in human plasma. \n \nApixaban also demonstrates anti-FXa activity as evident by reduction in Factor Xa enzyme activity in \nmultiple commercial anti-FXa kits, however results differ across kits. Data from clinical trials are only \navailable for the Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay. Anti-FXa activity exhibits a close direct \nlinear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, reaching maximum values at the time of \napixaban peak plasma concentrations. The relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and \nanti-FXa activity is approximately linear over a wide dose range of apixaban. \n \nTable 3 below shows the predicted steady state exposure and anti-Factor Xa activity. In non-valvular \natrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, the results \ndemonstrate a less than 1.7-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels.

The program \nwas designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and one or more additional \nrisk factors, such as: \n\n\n\n41 \n\n prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \n age ≥ 75 years \n hypertension \n diabetes mellitus \n symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II) \n \nARISTOTLE STUDY  \nIn the ARISTOTLE study a total of 18,201 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with \napixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%], see section 4.2) or \nwarfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), patients were exposed to study drug for a mean of 20 months. The \nmean age was 69.1 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1, 18.9 % of patients had prior stroke or \nTIA. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) and systemic embolism (see Table 4) compared with \nwarfarin. \n \nTable 4: Efficacy Outcomes in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE Study \n\n Apixaban  \nN=9,120 \nn (%/yr) \n\nWarfarin  \nN=9,081 \nn (%/yr) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n \np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism 212 (1.27) 265 (1.60) 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) 0.0114 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or unspecified 162 (0.97) 175 (1.05) 0.92 (0.74, 1.13)  \nHaemorrhagic 40 (0.24) 78 (0.47) 0.51 (0.35, 0.75)  \n\nSystemic embolism 15 (0.09) 17 (0.10) 0.87 (0.44, 1.75)  \n \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) \n(INR 2-3) was 66%. \n \nApixaban showed a reduction of stroke and systemic embolism compared to warfarin across the \ndifferent levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio \nfor apixaban vs warfarin was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.38, 1.40). \n \nKey secondary endpoints of major bleeding and all cause death were tested in a pre-specified \nhierarchical testing strategy to control the overall type 1 error in the trial.

The mean age was 69.9 years, the mean CHADS2 \nscore was 2.0 and 13.6% of patients had prior stroke or TIA. \n \nCommon reasons for unsuitability for VKA therapy in the AVERROES study included \nunable/unlikely to obtain INRs at requested intervals (42.6%), patient refused treatment with VKA \n(37.4%), CHADS2 score = 1 and physician did not recommend VKA (21.3%), patient could not be \nrelied on to adhere to VKA medicinal product instruction (15.0%), and difficulty/expected difficulty in \ncontacting patient in case of urgent dose change (11.7%). \n \nAVERROES was stopped early based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring \nCommittee due to clear evidence of reduction of stroke and systemic embolism with an acceptable \nsafety profile. \n \nThe overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.5% for apixaban and 1.3% for ASA in \nthe AVERROES study. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic, ischaemic or unspecified) or systemic embolism (see Table 6) \ncompared to ASA. \n \nTable 6: Key Efficacy Outcomes in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the AVERROES Study \n\n Apixaban \nN = 2,807  \n\nn (%/year) \n\nASA  \nN = 2,791 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard Ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n \n\np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism* 51 (1.62) 113 (3.63) 0.45 (0.32, 0.62) < 0.0001 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or \nunspecified \n\n43 (1.37) 97 (3.11) 0.44 (0.31, 0.63)  \n\nHaemorrhagic 6 (0.19) 9 (0.28) 0.67 (0.24, 1.88)      \nSystemic embolism 2 (0.06) 13 (0.41) 0.15 (0.03, 0.68)  \n\nStroke, systemic embolism, \nMI, or vascular death*† \n\n132 (4.21) 197 (6.35) 0.66 (0.53, 0.83) 0.003 \n\nMyocardial infarction 24 (0.76) 28 (0.89) 0.86 (0.50, 1.48)  \nVascular Death 84 (2.65) 96 (3.03) 0.87 (0.65, 1.17)  \n\nAll-cause death† 111 (3.51) 140 (4.42) 0.79 (0.62, 1.02) 0.068 \n* Assessed by sequential testing strategy designed to control the overall type I error in the trial \n\n\n\n43 \n\n† Secondary endpoint. \n \nThere was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding between apixaban \nand ASA (see Table 7). \n \nTable 7: Bleeding Events in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the AVERROES Study \n\n Apixaban \nN = 2,798 \nn(%/year) \n\nASA \nN = 2,780 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95%CI) \n\np-value \n\nMajor* 45 (1.41) 29 (0.92) 1.54 (0.96, 2.45)  0.0716 \nFatal, n 5 (0.16) 5 (0.16)   \nIntracranial, n 11 (0.34) 11 (0.35)   \n\nMajor + CRNM† 140 (4.46) 101 (3.24) 1.38 (1.07, 1.78) 0.0144 \nAll 325 (10.85) 250 (8.32) 1.30 (1.10, 1.53) 0.0017 \n\n*Major bleeding defined per International Society on Thrombosis ad Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. \n† Clinically Relevant Non-Major  \n \nNVAF patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI \nAUGUSTUS, an open-label, randomized, controlled, 2 by 2 factorial design trial, enrolled \n4614 patients with NVAF who had ACS (43%) and/or underwent PCI (56%). All patients received \nbackground therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel: 90.3%) prescribed per local standard of care. \n \nPatients were randomized up to 14 days after the ACS and/or PCI to either apixaban 5 mg twice daily \n(2.5 mg twice daily if two or more of the dose-reduction criteria were met; 10% received lower dose) \nor VKA and to either ASA (81 mg once daily) or placebo. The mean age was 69.9 years, 94% of \npatients randomized had a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, and 47% had a HAS-BLED score > 3. For \npatients randomised to VKA, the proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was 56%, \nwith 32% of time below TTR and 12% above TTR. \n \nThe primary objective of AUGUSTUS was to assess safety, with a primary endpoint of ISTH major or \nCRNM bleeding. In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major \nor CRNM bleeding at month 6 occurred in 241 (10.5%), and 332 (14.7%) patients in the apixaban arm \nand in the VKA arm respectively (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; 2-sided p<0.0001 for non inferiority \nand p<0.0001 for superiority). For VKA, additional analyses using subgroups by TTR showed that the \nhighest rate of bleeding was associated with the lowest quartile of TTR. The rate of bleeding was \nsimilar between apixaban and the highest quartile of TTR. \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major or CRNM \nbleeding at month 6 occurred in 367 (16.1%), and 204 (9.0%) patients in the ASA arm and in the \nplacebo arm respectively (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.23; two-sided p<0.0001). \n \nSpecifically, in apixaban-treated patients, major or CRNM bleeding occurred in 157 (13.7%), and 84 \n(7.4%) patients in the ASA arm and in the placebo arm respectively. In VKA-treated patients, major or \nCRNM bleeding occurred in 208 (18.5%), and 122 (10.8%) patients in the ASA arm and in the \nplacebo arm respectively. \n \nOther treatment effects were evaluated as a secondary objective of the study, with composite \nendpoints. \nIn the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization \noccured in 541 (23.5%) and 632 (27.4%) patients in the apixaban and in the VKA arm, respectively. \nThe composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or \nurgent revascularization) occured in 170 (7.4%), and 182 (7.9%) patients in the apixaban and in the \nVKA arm, respectively. \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization occurred \nin 604 (26.2%) and 569 (24.7%) patients in the ASA and in the placebo arm, respectively. The \ncomposite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or \nurgent revascularization) occured in 163 (7.1%), and 189 (8.2%) patients in the ASA and in the \nplacebo arm, respectively. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nEMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 patients who were either oral \nanticoagulant naïve or pre-treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion for NVAF. \nPatients were randomized 1:1 to apixaban or to heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of \ncardiovascular events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was conducted after at least 5 \ndoses of 5 mg twice daily apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients (see section 4.2)) or at \nleast 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading dose in selected patients (see section 4.2)) \nif earlier cardioversion was required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a loading dose (331 \npatients received the 10 mg dose and 11 patients received the 5 mg dose). \n \nThere were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n= 753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin \nand/or VKA group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All-cause death occurred in 2 patients \n(0.27%) in the apixaban group and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No systemic \nembolism events were reported. \n \nMajor bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 (0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, \nrespectively, in the apixaban group, compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) patients in the heparin \nand/or VKA group. \n \nThis exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety between apixaban and heparin and/or \nVKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe clinical program (AMPLIFY: apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin, AMPLIFY-EXT: apixaban \nversus placebo) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the treatment of \nDVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY), and extended therapy for the prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE \nfollowing 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment for DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Both \nstudies were randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, multinational trials in patients with \nsymptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. All the key safety and efficacy endpoints were \nadjudicated by an independent blinded committee. \n \nAMPLIFY STUDY \nIn the AMPLIFY study a total of 5,395 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 10 mg \ntwice daily orally for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin \n1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR≥ 2) and warfarin (target INR range \n2.0-3.0) orally for 6 months. \n \nThe mean age was 56.9 years and 89.8% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) \nwas 60.9. Apixaban showed a reduction in recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE- related death across \nthe different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the relative \nrisk for apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 1.61). \n \nIn the study, apixaban was shown to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the combined primary \nendpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related \ndeath (see Table 8). \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nTable 8: Efficacy Results in the AMPLIFY Study \n\n Apixaban \n\nN=2,609 \n\nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin/ \nWarfarin \n\nN=2,635 \n\nn (%) \n\nRelative Risk \n\n(95% CI) \n\nVTE or VTE-related \ndeath \n\n59 (2.3) 71 (2.7) 0.84 (0.60, 1.18)* \n\n DVT 20 (0.7) 33 (1.2)  \n\n PE 27 (1.0) 23 (0.9)  \n\n VTE-related \n death \n\n12 (0.4) 15 (0.6)  \n\nVTE or all-cause \ndeath \n\n84 (3.2) 104 (4.0) 0.82 (0.61, 1.08) \n\nVTE or CV-related \ndeath \n\n61 (2.3) 77 (2.9) 0.80 (0.57, 1.11) \n\nVTE, VTE-related \ndeath, or major \nbleeding \n\n73 (2.8) 118 (4.5) 0.62 (0.47, 0.83) \n\n* Noninferior compared to enoxaparin/warfarin (p-value < 0.0001) \n\n \n\nApixaban efficacy in initial treatment of VTE was consistent between patients who were treated for a \nPE [Relative Risk 0.9; 95% CI (0.5, 1.6)] or DVT [Relative Risk 0.8; 95% CI (0.5, 1.3)].

Apixaban is \nrapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 3 to 4 hours after tablet intake. Intake \nwith food does not affect apixaban AUC or Cmax at the 10 mg dose. Apixaban can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \nApixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposure for oral \ndoses up to 10 mg. At doses ≥ 25 mg apixaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability. Apixaban exposure parameters exhibit low to moderate variability reflected by a \nwithin-subject and inter-subject variability of ~20% CV and ~30% CV, respectively. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of \nwater, exposure was comparable to exposure after oral administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets with 30 g of apple \npuree, the Cmax and AUC were 21% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of \n2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in exposure is not considered clinically relevant. \n \nFollowing administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet suspended in 60 mL of D5W and \ndelivered via a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to exposure seen in other clinical trials \ninvolving healthy subjects receiving a single oral 5 mg apixaban tablet dose. \n \nGiven the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban, the bioavailability \nresults from the conducted studies are applicable to lower apixaban doses. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is \napproximately 21 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nApixaban has multiple routes of elimination. Of the administered apixaban dose in humans, \napproximately 25% was recovered as metabolites, with the majority recovered in faeces. Renal \nexcretion of apixaban accounts for approximately 27% of total clearance. Additional contributions \nfrom biliary and direct intestinal excretion were observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, \nrespectively. \n \nApixaban has a total clearance of about 3.3 L/h and a half-life of approximately 12 hours. \n \nO-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Apixaban is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from \nCYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in \nhuman plasma with no active circulating metabolites present. Apixaban is a substrate of transport \nproteins, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was no impact of impaired renal function on peak concentration of apixaban. There was an \nincrease in apixaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via measured \ncreatinine clearance. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min), moderate \n(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) renal \nimpairment, apixaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 16, 29, and 44% respectively, \ncompared to individuals with normal creatinine clearance. Renal impairment had no evident effect on \nthe relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-FXa activity. \n \nIn subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the AUC of apixaban was increased by 36% when a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered immediately after haemodialysis, compared to that \nseen in subjects with normal renal function. Haemodialysis, started two hours after administration of a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg, decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in these ESRD subjects, \ncorresponding to an apixaban dialysis clearance of 18 mL/min. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh A score 5 (n = 6) and \nscore 6 (n = 2), and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh B score 7 (n = 6) and \nscore 8 (n = 2), to 16 healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of apixaban 5 mg were not altered in subjects with hepatic impairment. Changes in \nanti-Factor Xa activity and INR were comparable between subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment and healthy subjects. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (above 65 years) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with \nmean AUC values being approximately 32% higher and no difference in Cmax. \n \nGender \nExposure to apixaban was approximately 18% higher in females than in males. \n \nEthnic origin and race \nThe results across phase I studies showed no discernible difference in apixaban pharmacokinetics \nbetween White/Caucasian, Asian and Black/African American subjects. Findings from a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients who received apixaban were generally consistent with the phase I \nresults. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nBody weight \nCompared to apixaban exposure in subjects with body weight of 65 to 85 kg, body weight > 120 kg \nwas associated with approximately 30% lower exposure and body weight < 50 kg was associated with \napproximately 30% higher exposure. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (anti-FXa activity, INR, PT, aPTT) has been evaluated after \nadministration of a wide range of doses (0.5 – 50 mg). The relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and anti-Factor Xa activity was best described by a linear model. The PK/PD \nrelationship observed in patients was consistent with that established in healthy subjects. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal \ndevelopment and juvenile toxicity. \n \nThe major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the \npharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to \nno increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of \nthe non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when \nextrapolating to humans. \n \n \n6.

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember and \n\ncontinue to follow your dosing schedule. \n Do not stop taking Eliquis without talking to your doctor, as you are at risk of suffering from a \n\nstroke or other complications. \n Eliquis helps to thin your blood. However, this may increase your risk of bleeding. \n Signs and symptoms of bleeding include bruising or bleeding under the skin, tar-coloured stools, \n\nblood in urine, nose-bleed, dizziness, tiredness, paleness or weakness, sudden severe headache, \ncoughing up blood or vomiting blood. \n\n If the bleeding does not stop on its own, seek medical attention immediately. \n If you need surgery or any invasive procedure, inform your doctor that you are taking Eliquis. \n\n \nInformation for healthcare professionals \n Eliquis (apixaban) is an oral anticoagulant acting by direct selective inhibition of factor Xa. \n Eliquis may increase the risk of bleeding. In case of major bleeding events, it should be stopped \n\nimmediately. \n Treatment with Eliquis does not require routine monitoring of exposure. A calibrated quantitative \n\nanti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations, e.g., overdose and emergency \nsurgery (prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial \nthromboplastin time (aPTT) clotting tests are not recommended) – see SmPC.  \n\n An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB.

What Eliquis is and what it is used for \n \nEliquis contains the active substance apixaban and belongs to a group of medicines called \nanticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which \nis an important component of blood clotting. \n \nEliquis is used in adults: \n- to prevent blood clots (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) from forming after hip or knee replacement \n\noperations. After an operation to the hip or knee you may be at a higher risk of developing blood \nclots in your leg veins. This can cause the legs to swell, with or without pain. If a blood clot travels \nfrom your leg to your lungs, it can block blood flow causing breathlessness, with or without chest \npain. This condition (pulmonary embolism) can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical \nattention. \n\n \n- to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial \n\nfibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the brain \nand lead to a stroke or to other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also known as a \nsystemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. \n\n \n- to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of your \n\nlungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood vessels of \nyour legs and/or lungs. \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you take Eliquis \n \nDo not take Eliquis if: \n\n- you are allergic to apixaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n- you are bleeding excessively \n- you have a disease in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding (such as an \n\nactive or a recent ulcer of your stomach or bowel, recent bleeding in your brain) \n- you have a liver disease which leads to increased risk of bleeding (hepatic coagulopathy) \n\n\n\n67 \n\n- you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g., warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or \nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment, while having a venous or arterial line and \nyou get heparin through this line to keep it open, or if a tube is inserted into your blood vessel \n(catheter ablation) to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take this medicine if you have any of the \nfollowing: \n\n- an increased risk of bleeding, such as: \n bleeding disorders, including conditions resulting in reduced platelet activity \n very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n you are older than 75 years \n you weigh 60 kg or less \n \n\n- a severe kidney disease or if you are on dialysis \n- a liver problem or a history of liver problems  \n Eliquis will be used with caution in patients with signs of altered liver function. \n- had a tube (catheter) or an injection into your spinal column (for anaesthesia or pain \n\nreduction), your doctor will tell you to take Eliquis 5 hours or more after catheter removal \n- if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n- if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \n\nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned \n \n\nTake special care with Eliquis \n- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the immune \n\nsystem that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if the \ntreatment may need to be changed. \n\n \nIf you need to have surgery or a procedure which may cause bleeding, your doctor might ask you to \ntemporarily stop taking this medicine for a short while. If you are not sure whether a procedure may \ncause bleeding ask your doctor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nEliquis is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Eliquis \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nSome medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and some may decrease its effects. Your doctor \nwill decide, if you should be treated with Eliquis when taking these medicines and how closely you \nshould be monitored. \n \nThe following medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and increase the chance for unwanted \nbleeding: \n\n- some medicines for fungal infections (e.g., ketoconazole, etc.) \n\n- some antiviral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g., ritonavir) \n\n- other medicines that are used to reduce blood clotting (e.g., enoxaparin, etc.) \n\n- anti-inflammatory or pain medicines (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid or naproxen). Especially, if you \nare older than 75 years and are taking acetylsalicylic acid, you may have an increased chance of \nbleeding. \n\n- medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g., diltiazem) \n\n\n\n68 \n\n- antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or serotonin \nnorepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors \n\n \nThe following medicines may reduce the ability of Eliquis to help prevent blood clots from forming: \n\n- medicines to prevent epilepsy or seizures (e.g., phenytoin, etc.) \n\n- St John’s Wort (a herbal supplement used for depression) \n\n- medicines to treat tuberculosis or other infections (e.g., rifampicin) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThe effects of Eliquis on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known.

Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for \nadvice before taking this medicine while breast-feeding. They will advise you to either stop breast-\nfeeding or to stop/not start taking Eliquis. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nEliquis has not been shown to impair your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nEliquis contains lactose (a type of sugar) and sodium \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product.  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \"sodium-\nfree\". \n \n \n3. How to take Eliquis \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nDose \n \nSwallow the tablet with a drink of water. Eliquis can be taken with or without food. \nTry to take the tablets at the same times every day to have the best treatment effect. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nEliquis. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water, or 5% dextrose in water, or apple juice or \napple puree, immediately before you take it. \n \nInstructions for crushing: \n\n Crush the tablets with a pestle and mortar. \n Transfer all the powder carefully into a suitable container then mix the powder with a little \n\ne.g., 30 mL (2 tablespoons), water or one of the other liquids mentioned above to make a \nmixture. \n\n Swallow the mixture. \n Rinse the pestle and mortar you used for crushing the tablet and the container, with a little \n\nwater or one of the other liquids (e.g., 30 mL), and swallow the rinse. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Eliquis tablet mixed in 60 mL of water or \n5% dextrose in water, through a nasogastric tube. \n \nTake Eliquis as recommended for the following: \n \nTo prevent blood clots from forming after hip or knee replacement operations. \nThe recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 2.5 mg twice a day. \nFor example, one in the morning and one in the evening.  \nYou should take the first tablet 12 to 24 hours after your operation. \n \nIf you have had a major hip operation you will usually take the tablets for 32 to38 days \nIf you have had a major knee operation you will usually take the tablets for 10 to 14 days \n \nTo prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat and at least \none additional risk factor. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 5 mg twice a day. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 2.5 mg twice a day if: \n\n-  you have severely reduced kidney function \n- two or more of the following apply to you: \n\n- your blood test results suggest poor kidney function (value of serum creatinine is \n1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) or greater) \n\n- you are 80 years old or older \n- your weight is 60 kg or lower. \n\n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet twice a day, for example, one in the morning and one in the \nevening. Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment for. \n \nTo treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs \n \nThe recommended dose is two tablets of Eliquis 5 mg twice a day for the first 7 days, for example, \ntwo in the morning and two in the evening. \nAfter 7 days the recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 5 mg twice a day, for example, one in the \nmorning and one in the evening.  \n \nFor preventing blood clots from re-occurring following completion of 6 months of treatment \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 2.5 mg twice a day for example, one in the morning \nand one in the evening.  \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment for. \n \nYour doctor might change your anticoagulant treatment as follows: \n \n- Changing from Eliquis to anticoagulant medicines \nStop taking Eliquis. Start treatment with the anticoagulant medicines (for example heparin) at the time \nyou would have taken the next tablet. \n  \n- Changing from anticoagulant medicines to Eliquis \nStop taking the anticoagulant medicines. Start treatment with Eliquis at the time you would have had \nthe next dose of anticoagulant medicine, then continue as normal. \n \n- Changing from treatment with anticoagulant containing vitamin K antagonist (e.g., warfarin) to \n\nEliquis \nStop taking the medicine containing a vitamin K antagonist. Your doctor needs to do \nblood-measurements and instruct you when to start taking Eliquis. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n- Changing from Eliquis to anticoagulant treatment containing vitamin K antagonist (e.g., warfarin). \nIf your doctor tells you that you have to start taking the medicine containing a vitamin K antagonist, \ncontinue to take Eliquis for at least 2 days after your first dose of the medicine containing a vitamin K \nantagonist. Your doctor needs to do blood-measurements and instruct you when to stop taking Eliquis. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \n \nIf your abnormal heartbeat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take \nEliquis at the times your doctor tells you, to prevent blood clots in blood vessels in your brain and \nother blood vessels in your body. \n \nIf you take more Eliquis than you should \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of Eliquis. Take the \nmedicine pack with you, even if there are no tablets left. \n \nIf you take more Eliquis than recommended, you may have an increased risk of bleeding. If bleeding \noccurs, surgery, blood transfusions, or other treatments that may reverse anti-factor Xa activity may be \nrequired. \n \nIf you forget to take Eliquis \n \n- Take the dose as soon as you remember and: \n\n- take the next dose of Eliquis at the usual time \n- then continue as normal. \n\n \nIf you are not sure what to do or have missed more than one dose, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse. \n \nIf you stop taking Eliquis \n \nDo not stop taking Eliquis without talking to your doctor first, because the risk of developing a blood \nclot could be higher if you stop treatment too early. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

What Eliquis is and what it is used for \n \nEliquis contains the active substance apixaban and belongs to a group of medicines called \nanticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which \nis an important component of blood clotting. \n \nEliquis is used in adults: \n- to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial \n\nfibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the brain \nand lead to a stroke or to other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also known as a \nsystemic embolism).
