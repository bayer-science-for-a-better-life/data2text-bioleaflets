QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nSTAYVEER 62.5 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 62.5 mg bosentan (as monohydrate). \n \nSTAYVEER 125 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 125 mg bosentan (as monohydrate). \n \nExcipient with known effect  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablets): \n \nSTAYVEER 62.5 mg film-coated tablets \nOrange-white, round, biconvex, film-coated tablets, embossed with “62,5” on one side. \n \nSTAYVEER 125 mg film-coated tablets \nOrange-white, oval, biconvex, film-coated tablets, embossed with “125” on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in \npatients with WHO functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in: \n• Primary (idiopathic and heritable) pulmonary arterial hypertension \n• Pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial \n\npulmonary disease \n• Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and \n\nEisenmenger’s physiology \n \nSome improvements have also been shown in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension WHO \nfunctional class II (see section 5.1). \n \nSTAYVEER is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic \nsclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTablets are to be taken orally morning and evening, with or without food. The film-coated tablets are \nto be swallowed with water. \nPatients should be advised not to swallow the desiccant found in the white high-density polyethylene \nbottles. \n \nPosology \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of PAH. \nA Patient Alert Card providing important safety information that patients need to be aware of before \nand during treatment with STAYVEER is included in the pack. \n \nAdults \nIn adult patients, STAYVEER treatment should be initiated at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for \n4 weeks and then increased to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily. The same \nrecommendations apply to re-introduction of STAYVEER after treatment interruption (see section \n4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nPaediatric pharmacokinetic data have shown that bosentan plasma concentrations in children with \nPAH aged from 1 year to 15 years were on average lower than in adult patients and were not increased \nby increasing the dose of STAYVEER above 2 mg/kg body weight or by increasing the dosing \nfrequency from twice daily to three times daily (see section 5.2). Increasing the dose or the dosing \nfrequency will likely not result in additional clinical benefit. \n \nBased on these pharmacokinetic results, when used in children with PAH aged 1 year and older, the \nrecommended starting and maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg morning and evening. \n \nIn neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), the benefit of bosentan \nhas not been shown in the standard-of-care treatment. No recommendation on a posology can be made \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nManagement in the event of clinical deterioration of PAH \n \nIn the event of clinical deterioration (e.g., decrease in 6-minute walk test distance by at least 10% \ncompared with pre-treatment measurement) despite STAYVEER treatment for at least 8 weeks (target \ndose for at least 4 weeks), alternative therapies should be considered. However, some patients who \nshow no response after 8 weeks of treatment with STAYVEER may respond favourably after an \nadditional 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. \n \nIn the event of late clinical deterioration despite treatment with STAYVEER (i.e., after several months \nof treatment), the treatment should be re-assessed. Some patients not responding well to 125 mg twice \ndaily of STAYVEER may slightly improve their exercise capacity when the dose is increased to \n250 mg twice daily. A careful benefit/risk assessment should be made, taking into consideration that \nthe liver toxicity is dose dependent (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment \n \nThere is limited experience with abrupt discontinuation of STAYVEER in patients with PAH. No \nevidence for acute rebound has been observed. However, to avoid the possible occurrence of harmful \nclinical deterioration due to potential rebound effect, gradual dose reduction (halving the dose for \n3 to 7 days) should be considered. Intensified monitoring is recommended during the discontinuation \nperiod. \nIf the decision to withdraw STAYVEER is taken, it should be done gradually while an alternative \ntherapy is introduced. \n \nSystemic sclerosis with ongoing digital ulcer disease \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of \nsystemic sclerosis.  \nA Patient Alert Card providing important safety information that patients need to be aware of before \nand during treatment with STAYVEER is included in the pack. \n \nAdults \nSTAYVEER treatment should be initiated at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then \nincreased to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily. The same recommendations apply to re-\nintroduction of STAYVEER after treatment interruption (see section 4.4). \n \nControlled clinical study experience in this indication is limited to 6 months (see section 5.1). \n \nThe patient’s response to treatment and need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated on a regular \nbasis. A careful benefit/risk assessment should be made, taking into consideration the liver toxicity of \nbosentan (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere are no data on the safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 years. Pharmacokinetic \ndata are not available for STAYVEER in young children with this disease. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nSTAYVEER is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe liver dysfunction (see sections 4.3, \n4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (i.e., Child-Pugh \nclass A) (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is required in \npatients undergoing dialysis (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over the age of 65 years. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Moderate to severe hepatic impairment, i.e., Child-Pugh class B or C (see section 5.2) \n\n\n\n5 \n\n• Baseline values of liver aminotransferases, i.e., aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), greater than 3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN; see section 4.4) \n\n• Concomitant use of cyclosporine A (see section 4.5) \n• Pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable methods of contraception (see \n\nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe efficacy of STAYVEER has not been established in patients with severe PAH. Transfer to a \ntherapy that is recommended at the severe stage of the disease (e.g., epoprostenol) should be \nconsidered if the clinical condition deteriorates (see section 4.2). \n \nThe benefit/risk balance of bosentan has not been established in patients with WHO class I functional \nstatus of PAH. \n \nSTAYVEER should only be initiated if the systemic systolic blood pressure is higher than 85 mmHg. \n \nSTAYVEER has not been shown to have a beneficial effect on the healing of existing digital ulcers. \n \nLiver function \nElevations in liver aminotransferases, i.e., aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and/or ALT), \nassociated with bosentan are dose dependent. Liver enzyme changes typically occur within the first \n26 weeks of treatment but may also occur late in treatment (see section 4.8). These increases may be \npartly due to competitive inhibition of the elimination of bile salts from hepatocytes but other \nmechanisms, which have not been clearly established, are probably also involved in the occurrence of \nliver dysfunction. The accumulation of bosentan in hepatocytes leading to cytolysis with potentially \nsevere damage of the liver, or an immunological mechanism, are not excluded. Liver dysfunction risk \nmay also be increased when medicinal products that are inhibitors of the bile salt export pump, e.g., \nrifampicin, glibenclamide and cyclosporine A (see sections 4.3 and 4.5), are co-administered with \nbosentan, but limited data are available. \n \nLiver aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and \nsubsequently at monthly intervals for the duration of treatment with STAYVEER. In addition, \nliver aminotransferase levels must be measured 2 weeks after any dose increase. \n \nRecommendations in the event of ALT/AST elevations \n \nALT/AST levels Treatment and monitoring recommendations \n> 3 and ≤ 5 × ULN The result should be confirmed by a second liver test; if confirmed, a decision \n\nshould be made on an individual basis to continue STAYVEER, possibly at a \nreduced dose, or to stop STAYVEER administration (see section 4.2). \nMonitoring of aminotransferase levels should be continued at least every \n2 weeks. If the aminotransferase levels return to pre-treatment values \ncontinuing or re-introducing STAYVEER according to the conditions \ndescribed below should be considered. \n\n> 5 and ≤ 8 × ULN The result should be confirmed by a second liver test; if confirmed, treatment \nshould be stopped and aminotransferase levels monitored at least every \n2 weeks. If the aminotransferase levels return to pre-treatment values re-\nintroducing STAYVEER according to the conditions described below should \nbe considered. \n\n> 8 × ULN Treatment must be stopped and re-introduction of STAYVEER is not to be \nconsidered. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIn the event of associated clinical symptoms of liver injury, i.e., nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal \npain, jaundice, unusual lethargy or fatigue, flu-like syndrome (arthralgia, myalgia, fever), treatment \nmust be stopped and re-introduction of STAYVEER is not to be considered. \n \nRe-introduction of treatment \nRe-introduction of treatment with STAYVEER should only be considered if the potential benefits of \ntreatment with STAYVEER outweigh the potential risks and when liver aminotransferase levels are \nwithin pre-treatment values. The advice of a hepatologist is recommended. Re-introduction must \nfollow the guidelines detailed in section 4.2. Aminotransferase levels must then be checked within \n3 days after re-introduction, then again after a further 2 weeks, and thereafter according to the \nrecommendations above. \nULN = upper limit of normal \n \nHaemoglobin concentration \n \nTreatment with bosentan has been associated with dose-related decreases in haemoglobin \nconcentration (see section 4.8). In placebo-controlled studies, bosentan-related decreases in \nhaemoglobin concentration were not progressive, and stabilised after the first 4–12 weeks of \ntreatment. It is recommended that haemoglobin concentrations be checked prior to initiation of \ntreatment, every month during the first 4 months, and quarterly thereafter. If a clinically relevant \ndecrease in haemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation and investigation should be \nundertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment. In the post-marketing period, cases \nof anaemia requiring red blood cell transfusion have been reported (see section 4.8). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nAs STAYVEER may render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, and taking into account the risk that \npulmonary hypertension deteriorates with pregnancy as well as the teratogenic effects observed in \nanimals: \n \n• STAYVEER treatment must not be initiated in women of childbearing potential unless they \n\npractise reliable contraception and the result of the pre-treatment pregnancy test is negative \n• Hormonal contraceptives cannot be the sole method of contraception during treatment with \n\nSTAYVEER \n• Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended during treatment to allow early detection of \n\npregnancy \n \nFor further information see sections 4.5 and 4.6. \n \nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease \n \nCases of pulmonary oedema have been reported with vasodilators (mainly prostacyclins) when used in \npatients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Consequently, should signs of pulmonary oedema \noccur when STAYVEER is administered in patients with PAH, the possibility of associated veno-\nocclusive disease should be considered. In the post-marketing period there have been rare reports of \npulmonary oedema in patients treated with STAYVEER who had a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary \nveno-occlusive disease. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension patients with concomitant left ventricular failure \n \nNo specific study has been performed in patients with pulmonary hypertension and concomitant left \nventricular dysfunction. However, 1,611 patients (804 bosentan- and 807 placebo-treated patients) \n\n\n\n7 \n\nwith severe chronic heart failure (CHF) were treated for a mean duration of 1.5 years in a \nplacebo-controlled study (study AC-052-301/302 [ENABLE 1 & 2]). In this study there was an \nincreased incidence of hospitalisation due to CHF during the first 4–8 weeks of treatment with \nbosentan, which could have been the result of fluid retention. In this study, fluid retention was \nmanifested by early weight gain, decreased haemoglobin concentration and increased incidence of leg \noedema. At the end of this study, there was no difference in overall hospitalisations for heart failure \nnor in mortality between bosentan- and placebo-treated patients. Consequently, it is recommended that \npatients be monitored for signs of fluid retention (e.g., weight gain), especially if they concomitantly \nsuffer from severe systolic dysfunction. Should this occur, starting treatment with diuretics is \nrecommended, or the dose of existing diuretics should be increased. Treatment with diuretics should \nbe considered in patients with evidence of fluid retention before the start of treatment with \nSTAYVEER. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension associated with HIV infection \n \nThere is limited clinical study experience with the use of STAYVEER in patients with PAH associated \nwith HIV infection, treated with antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 5.1). An interaction \nstudy between bosentan and lopinavir+ritonavir in healthy subjects showed increased plasma \nconcentrations of bosentan, with the maximum level during the first 4 days of treatment (see section \n4.5). When treatment with STAYVEER is initiated in patients who require ritonavir-boosted protease \ninhibitors, the patient’s tolerability of STAYVEER should be closely monitored with special attention, \nat the beginning of the initiation phase, to the risk of hypotension and to liver function tests. An \nincreased long-term risk of hepatic toxicity and haematological adverse events cannot be excluded \nwhen bosentan is used in combination with antiretroviral medicinal products. Due to the potential for \ninteractions related to the inducing effect of bosentan on CYP450 (see section 4.5), which could affect \nthe efficacy of antiretroviral therapy, these patients should also be monitored carefully regarding their \nHIV infection. \n \nPulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \n \nSafety and tolerability of bosentan was investigated in an exploratory, uncontrolled 12-week study in \n11 patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to severe COPD (stage III of GOLD \nclassification). An increase in minute ventilation and a decrease in oxygen saturation were observed, \nand the most frequent adverse event was dyspnoea, which resolved with discontinuation of bosentan. \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \n \nConcomitant use of STAYVEER and cyclosporine A is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of STAYVEER with glibenclamide, fluconazole and rifampicin is not recommended. \nFor further details please refer to section 4.5. \n \nConcomitant administration of both a CYP3A4 inhibitor and a CYP2C9 inhibitor with STAYVEER \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBosentan is an inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. In vitro \ndata also suggest an induction of CYP2C19. Consequently, plasma concentrations of substances \nmetabolised by these isoenzymes will be decreased when STAYVEER is co-administered. The \npossibility of altered efficacy of medicinal products metabolised by these isoenzymes should be \nconsidered. The dosage of these products may need to be adjusted after initiation, dose change or \ndiscontinuation of concomitant STAYVEER treatment. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nBosentan is metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Inhibition of these isoenzymes may increase the \nplasma concentration of bosentan (see ketoconazole). The influence of CYP2C9 inhibitors on \nbosentan concentration has not been studied. The combination should be used with caution. \n \nFluconazole and other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4: Co-administration with fluconazole, \nwhich inhibits mainly CYP2C9, but to some extent also CYP3A4, could lead to large increases in \nplasma concentrations of bosentan. The combination is not recommended. For the same reason, \nconcomitant administration of both a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or \nritonavir) and a CYP2C9 inhibitor (such as voriconazole) with STAYVEER is not recommended. \n \nCyclosporine A: Co-administration of STAYVEER and cyclosporine A (a calcineurin inhibitor) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). When co-administered, initial trough concentrations of bosentan \nwere approximately 30-fold higher than those measured after bosentan alone. At steady state, bosentan \nplasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than with bosentan alone. The mechanism of this \ninteraction is most likely inhibition of transport protein-mediated uptake of bosentan into hepatocytes \nby cyclosporine. The blood concentrations of cyclosporine A (a CYP3A4 substrate) decreased by \napproximately 50%. This is most likely due to induction of CYP3A4 by bosentan. \n \nTacrolimus, sirolimus: Co-administration of tacrolimus or sirolimus and STAYVEER has not been \nstudied in man but co-administration of tacrolimus or sirolimus and STAYVEER may result in \nincreased plasma concentrations of bosentan in analogy to co-administration with cyclosporine A. \nConcomitant STAYVEER may reduce the plasma concentrations of tacrolimus and sirolimus. \nTherefore, concomitant use of STAYVEER and tacrolimus or sirolimus is not advisable. Patients in \nneed of the combination should be closely monitored for adverse events related to STAYVEER and \nfor tacrolimus and sirolimus blood concentrations. \n \nGlibenclamide: Co-administration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily for 5 days decreased the plasma \nconcentrations of glibenclamide (a CYP3A4 substrate) by 40%, with potential significant decrease of \nthe hypoglycaemic effect. The plasma concentrations of bosentan were also decreased by 29%. In \naddition, an increased incidence of elevated aminotransferases was observed in patients receiving \nconcomitant therapy. Both glibenclamide and bosentan inhibit the bile salt export pump, which could \nexplain the elevated aminotransferases. This combination should not be used. No drug-drug interaction \ndata are available with the other sulfonylureas. \n \nRifampicin: Co-administration in 9 healthy subjects for 7 days of bosentan 125 mg twice daily with \nrifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, decreased the plasma concentrations of \nbosentan by 58%, and this decrease could achieve almost 90% in an individual case. As a result, a \nsignificantly reduced effect of bosentan is expected when it is co-administered with rifampicin. \nConcomitant use of rifampicin and STAYVEER is not recommended. Data on other CYP3A4 \ninducers, e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and St. John’s wort are lacking, but their \nconcomitant administration is expected to lead to reduced systemic exposure to bosentan. A clinically \nsignificant reduction of efficacy cannot be excluded. \n \nLopinavir+ritonavir (and other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors): Co-administration of bosentan \n125 mg twice daily and lopinavir+ritonavir 400+100 mg twice daily for 9.5 days in healthy volunteers \nresulted in initial trough plasma concentrations of bosentan that were approximately 48-fold higher \nthan those measured after bosentan administered alone. On day 9, plasma concentrations of bosentan \nwere approximately 5-fold higher than with bosentan administered alone. Inhibition by ritonavir of \ntransport protein-mediated uptake into hepatocytes and of CYP3A4, thereby reducing the clearance of \nbosentan, most likely causes this interaction. When administered concomitantly with \nlopinavir+ritonavir, or other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, the patient’s tolerability of \nSTAYVEER should be monitored. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nAfter co-administration of bosentan for 9.5 days, the plasma exposures to lopinavir and ritonavir \ndecreased to a clinically non-significant extent (by approximately 14% and 17%, respectively). \nHowever, full induction by bosentan might not have been reached and a further decrease of protease \ninhibitors cannot be excluded. Appropriate monitoring of the HIV therapy is recommended. Similar \neffects would be expected with other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nOther antiretroviral agents: No specific recommendation can be made with regard to other available \nantiretroviral agents due to the lack of data. Due to the marked hepatotoxicity of nevirapine, which \ncould add to bosentan liver toxicity, this combination is not recommended. \n \nHormonal contraceptives: Co-administration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily for 7 days with a single \ndose of oral contraceptive containing norethisterone 1 mg + ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg decreased the \nAUC of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol by 14% and 31%, respectively. However, decreases in \nexposure were as much as 56% and 66%, respectively, in individual subjects. Therefore, hormone-\nbased contraceptives alone, regardless of the route of administration (i.e., oral, injectable, transdermal \nor implantable forms), are not considered as reliable methods of contraception (see sections 4.4 and \n4.6). \n \nWarfarin: Co-administration of bosentan 500 mg twice daily for 6 days decreased the plasma \nconcentrations of both S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) and R-warfarin (a CYP3A4 substrate) by \n29% and 38%, respectively. Clinical experience with concomitant administration of bosentan with \nwarfarin in patients with PAH did not result in clinically relevant changes in International Normalized \nRatio (INR) or warfarin dose (baseline versus end of the clinical studies). In addition, the frequency of \nchanges in warfarin dose during the studies due to changes in INR or due to adverse events was \nsimilar among bosentan- and placebo-treated patients. No dose adjustment is needed for warfarin and \nsimilar oral anticoagulant agents when bosentan is initiated, but intensified monitoring of INR is \nrecommended, especially during bosentan initiation and the up-titration period. \n \nSimvastatin: Co-administration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily for 5 days decreased the plasma \nconcentrations of simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) and its active β-hydroxy acid metabolite by 34% \nand 46%, respectively. The plasma concentrations of bosentan were not affected by concomitant \nsimvastatin. Monitoring of cholesterol levels and subsequent dosage adjustment should be considered. \n \nKetoconazole: Co-administration for 6 days of bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily with ketoconazole, a \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan approximately 2-fold. No \ndose adjustment of STAYVEER is considered necessary. Although not demonstrated through in vivo \nstudies, similar increases in bosentan plasma concentrations are expected with the other potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (such as itraconazole or ritonavir). However, when combined with a CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, patients who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 are at risk of increases in bosentan plasma \nconcentrations that may be of higher magnitude, thus leading to potential harmful adverse events. \n \nEpoprostenol: Limited data obtained from a study (AC-052-356 [BREATHE-3]) in which \n10 paediatric patients received the combination of bosentan and epoprostenol indicate that after both \nsingle- and multiple-dose administration, the Cmax and AUC values of bosentan were similar in \npatients with or without continuous infusion of epoprostenol (see section 5.1). \n \nSildenafil: Co-administration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily (steady state) with sildenafil 80 mg three \ntimes a day (at steady state) concomitantly administered during 6 days in healthy volunteers resulted \nin a 63% decrease in the sildenafil AUC and a 50% increase in the bosentan AUC. Caution is \nrecommended in the case of co-administration. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTadalafil: Bosentan (125 mg twice daily) reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure by \n42% and Cmax by 27% following multiple dose co-administration. Tadalafil did not affect the exposure \n(AUC and Cmax) of bosentan or its metabolites. \n \nDigoxin: Co-administration for 7 days of bosentan 500 mg twice daily with digoxin decreased the \nAUC, Cmax and Cmin of digoxin by 12%, 9% and 23%, respectively. The mechanism for this interaction \nmay be induction of P-glycoprotein. This interaction is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (teratogenicity, embryotoxicity; see section 5.3). \nThere are no reliable data on the use of STAYVEER in pregnant women. The potential risk for \nhumans is still unknown. STAYVEER is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nBefore the initiation of STAYVEER treatment in women of childbearing potential, the absence of \npregnancy should be checked, appropriate advice on reliable methods of contraception provided, and \nreliable contraception initiated. Patients and prescribers must be aware that due to potential \npharmacokinetic interactions, STAYVEER may render hormonal contraceptives ineffective (see \nsection 4.5). Therefore, women of childbearing potential must not use hormonal contraceptives \n(including oral, injectable, transdermal or implantable forms) as the sole method of contraception but \nmust use an additional or an alternative reliable method of contraception. If there is any doubt about \nwhat contraceptive advice should be given to the individual patient, consultation with a gynaecologist \nis recommended. Because of possible hormonal contraception failure during STAYVEER treatment, \nand also bearing in mind the risk that pulmonary hypertension severely deteriorates with pregnancy, \nmonthly pregnancy tests during treatment with STAYVEER are recommended to allow early detection \nof pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether bosentan is excreted into human breast milk. Breast-feeding is not \nrecommended during treatment with STAYVEER. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies showed testicular effects (see section 5.3). In a study investigating the effects of \nbosentan on testicular function in male PAH patients, 8 out of 24 patients showed a decreased sperm \nconcentration from baseline of at least 42% after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan. Based on \nthese findings and preclinical data, it cannot be excluded that bosentan may have a detrimental effect \non spermatogenesis in men. In male children, a long-term impact on fertility after treatment with \nbosentan cannot be excluded. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo specific studies have been conducted to assess the direct effect of STAYVEER on the ability to \ndrive and use machines. However, STAYVEER may induce hypotension, with symptoms of dizziness, \nblurred vision or syncope that could affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn 20 placebo-controlled studies, conducted in a variety of therapeutic indications, a total of 2,486 \npatients were treated with bosentan at daily doses ranging from 100 mg to 2000 mg and 1,838 patients \nwere treated with placebo. The mean treatment duration was 45 weeks. Adverse reactions were \ndefined as events occurring in at least 1% of patients on bosentan and at a frequency at least 0.5% \nmore than on placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions are headache (11.5%), oedema / fluid \nretention (13.2%), abnormal liver function test (10.9%) and anaemia / haemoglobin decrease (9.9%). \n \nTreatment with bosentan has been associated with dose-dependent elevations in liver \naminotransferases and decreases in haemoglobin concentration (see section 4.4). \n \nAdverse reactions observed in 20 placebo-controlled studies and post-marketing experience with \nbosentan are ranked according to frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nNo clinically relevant differences in adverse reactions were observed between the overall dataset and \nthe approved indications. \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Anaemia, haemoglobin decrease, \n(see section 4.4) \n\n Not known Anaemia or haemoglobin \ndecreases requiring red blood cell \ntransfusion1 \n\n Uncommon Thrombocytopenia1 \n Uncommon Neutropenia, leukopenia1 \nImmune system disorders Common Hypersensitivity reactions \n\n(including dermatitis, pruritus and \nrash)2 \n\n Rare Anaphylaxis and/or angioedema1 \nNervous system disorders Very common Headache3 \n Common Syncope1, 4 \nEye disorders Not known Blurred vision1 \nCardiac disorders Common Palpitations1, 4 \nVascular disorders Common Flushing  \n Common Hypotension1, 4 \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Nasal congestion1 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Gastrooesophageal reflux disease \nDiarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very common Abnormal liver function test (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n Uncommon Aminotransferase elevations \nassociated with hepatitis \n(including possible exacerbation \nof underlying hepatitis) and/or \njaundice1 (see section 4.4) \n\n Rare Liver cirrhosis, liver failure1 \n\n\n\n12 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders Common Erythema \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions  \n\nVery common  \n \n\nOedema, fluid retention5 \n\n1 Data derived from post-marketing experience, frequencies based on statistical modelling of placebo-controlled clinical \ntrial data. \n\n2 Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9.9% of patients on bosentan and 9.1% of patients on placebo. \n3 Headache was reported in 11.5% of patients on bosentan and 9.8% of patients on placebo. \n4 These types of reactions can also be related to the underlying disease. \n5 Oedema or fluid retention was reported in 13.2% of patients on bosentan and 10.9% of patients on placebo. \n \nIn the post-marketing period rare cases of unexplained hepatic cirrhosis were reported after prolonged \ntherapy with STAYVEER in patients with multiple co-morbidities and therapies with medicinal \nproducts. There have also been rare reports of liver failure. These cases reinforce the importance of \nstrict adherence to the monthly schedule for monitoring of liver function for the duration of treatment \nwith STAYVEER (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUncontrolled clinical studies in paediatric patients \n \nThe safety profile in the first paediatric uncontrolled study performed with the film-coated tablet \n(BREATHE-3: n = 19, median age 10 years [range 3–15 years], open-label bosentan 2 mg/kg twice \ndaily; treatment duration 12 weeks) was similar to that observed in the pivotal trials in adult patients \nwith PAH. In BREATHE-3, the most frequent adverse reactions were flushing (21%), headache, and \nabnormal liver function test (each 16%).  \n \nA pooled analysis of uncontrolled paediatric studies conducted in PAH with the bosentan 32 mg \ndispersible tablet formulation (FUTURE 1/2, FUTURE 3/Extension) included a total of 100 children \ntreated with bosentan 2 mg/kg twice daily (n = 33), 2 mg/kg three times daily (n = 31), or 4 mg/kg \ntwice daily (n = 36). At enrolment, six patients were between 3 months and 1 year old, 15 children \nwere between 1 and less than 2 years old, and 79 were between 2 and 12 years old. The median \ntreatment duration was 71.8 weeks (range 0.4–258 weeks). \n \nThe safety profile in this pooled analysis of uncontrolled paediatric studies was similar to that \nobserved in the pivotal trials in adult patients with PAH except for infections, which were more \nfrequently reported than in adults (69.0% vs 41.3%). This difference in infection frequency may in \npart be due to the longer median treatment exposure in the paediatric set (median 71.8 weeks) \ncompared with the adult set (median 17.4 weeks). The most frequent adverse events were upper \nrespiratory tract infections (25%), pulmonary (arterial) hypertension (20%), nasopharyngitis (17%), \npyrexia (15%), vomiting (13%), bronchitis (10%), abdominal pain (10%), and diarrhoea (10%). There \nwas no relevant difference in adverse event frequencies between patients above and below the age of 2 \nyears; however, this is based on only 21 children less than 2 years, including 6 patients between 3 \nmonths to 1 year of age. Adverse events of liver abnormalities and anaemia/haemoglobin decrease \noccurred in 9% and 5% of patients, respectively. \n \nIn a randomised placebo-controlled study, conducted in PPHN patients (FUTURE-4), a total of 13 \nneonates were treated with the bosentan dispersible tablet formulation at a dose of 2 mg/kg twice daily \n(8 patients were on placebo). The median bosentan and placebo treatment duration was, respectively, \n4.5 days (range 0.5–10.0 days) and 4.0 days (range 2.5–6.5 days). The most frequent adverse events in \nthe bosentan- and placebo-treated patients were, respectively, anaemia or haemoglobin decrease (7 and \n2 patients), generalised oedema (3 and 0 patients), and vomiting (2 and 0 patients). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLiver test abnormalities \n \nIn the clinical programme, dose-dependent elevations in liver aminotransferases generally occurred \nwithin the first 26 weeks of treatment, usually developed gradually, and were mainly asymptomatic. In \nthe post-marketing period rare cases of liver cirrhosis and liver failure have been reported. \n \nThe mechanism of this adverse effect is unclear. These elevations in aminotransferases may reverse \nspontaneously while continuing treatment with the maintenance dose of STAYVEER or after dose \nreduction, but interruption or cessation may be necessary (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the 20 integrated placebo-controlled studies, elevations in liver aminotransferases ≥ 3 ×ULN were \nobserved in 11.2% of the bosentan-treated patients as compared to 2.4% of the placebo-treated \npatients. Elevations to ≥ 8 × ULN were seen in 3.6% of the bosentan-treated patients and 0.4% of the \nplacebo-treated patients. Elevations in aminotransferases were associated with elevated bilirubin \n(≥ 2 × ULN) without evidence of biliary obstruction in 0.2% (5 patients) on bosentan and 0.3% \n(6 patients) on placebo. \n \nIn the pooled analysis of 100 PAH children from uncontrolled paediatric studies FUTURE 1/2 and \nFUTURE 3/Extension, elevations in liver aminotransferases ≥ 3 × ULN were observed in 2% of \npatients. \n \nIn the FUTURE-4 study including 13 neonates with PPHN treated with bosentan 2 mg/kg twice daily \nfor less than 10 days (range 0.5–10.0 days), there were no cases of liver aminotransferases ≥ 3 × ULN \nduring treatment, but one case of hepatitis occurred 3 days after the end of bosentan treatment. \n \nHaemoglobin \n \nIn the adult placebo-controlled studies, a decrease in haemoglobin concentration to below 10 g/dL \nfrom baseline was reported in 8.0% of bosentan-treated patients and 3.9% of placebo-treated patients \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIn the pooled analysis of 100 PAH children from uncontrolled paediatric studies FUTURE 1/2 and \nFUTURE 3/Extension, a decrease in haemoglobin concentration from baseline to below 10 g/dL was \nreported in 10.0% of patients. There was no decrease to below 8 g/dL. \n \nIn the FUTURE-4 study, 6 out of 13 bosentan-treated neonates with PPHN experienced a decrease in \nhaemoglobin from within the reference range at baseline to below the lower limit of normal during the \ntreatment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nBosentan has been administered as a single dose of up to 2,400 mg to healthy subjects and up to \n2,000 mg/day for 2 months in patients with a disease other than pulmonary hypertension. The most \ncommon adverse reaction was headache of mild to moderate intensity. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nMassive overdose may result in pronounced hypotension requiring active cardiovascular support. In \nthe post-marketing period there was one reported overdose of 10,000 mg of bosentan taken by an \nadolescent male patient. He had symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dizziness, sweating and \nblurred vision. He recovered completely within 24 hours with blood pressure support. Note: bosentan \nis not removed through dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antihypertensives, ATC code: C02KX01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with affinity for both endothelin A and B \n(ETA and ETB) receptors. Bosentan decreases both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance \nresulting in increased cardiac output without increasing heart rate. \n \nThe neurohormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known and can also \npromote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, and is pro-inflammatory. \nThese effects are mediated by endothelin binding to ETA and ETB receptors located in the endothelium \nand vascular smooth muscle cells. ET-1 concentrations in tissues and plasma are increased in several \ncardiovascular disorders and connective tissue diseases, including PAH, scleroderma, acute and \nchronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension and atherosclerosis, suggesting a \npathogenic role of ET-1 in these diseases. In PAH and heart failure, in the absence of endothelin \nreceptor antagonism, elevated ET-1 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and \nprognosis of these diseases. \n \nBosentan competes with the binding of ET-1 and other ET peptides to both ETA and ETB receptors, \nwith a slightly higher affinity for ETA receptors (Ki = 4.1–43 nanomolar) than for ETB receptors \n(Ki = 38–730 nanomolar). Bosentan specifically antagonises ET receptors and does not bind to other \nreceptors. \n \nEfficacy \n \nAnimal models \nIn animal models of pulmonary hypertension, chronic oral administration of bosentan reduced \npulmonary vascular resistance and reversed pulmonary vascular and right ventricular hypertrophy. In \nan animal model of pulmonary fibrosis, bosentan reduced collagen deposition in the lungs. \n \nEfficacy in adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension \nTwo randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted in 32 \n(study AC-052-351) and 213 (study AC-052-352 [BREATHE-1]) adult patients with WHO functional \nclass III–IV PAH (primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension secondary mainly to \nscleroderma). After 4 weeks of bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily, the maintenance doses studied in these \nstudies were 125 mg twice daily in AC-052-351, and 125 mg twice daily and 250 mg twice daily in \nAC-052-352. \n \nBosentan was added to patients’ current therapy, which could include a combination of anticoagulants, \nvasodilators (e.g., calcium channel blockers), diuretics, oxygen and digoxin, but not epoprostenol. \nControl was placebo plus current therapy. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe primary endpoint for each study was change in 6-minute walk distance at 12 weeks for the first \nstudy and 16 weeks for the second study. In both studies, treatment with bosentan resulted in \nsignificant increases in exercise capacity. The placebo-corrected increases in walk distance compared \nwith baseline were 76 metres (p = 0.02; t-test) and 44 metres (p = 0.0002; Mann-Whitney U test) at the \nprimary endpoint of each study, respectively. The differences between the two groups, 125 mg twice \ndaily and 250 mg twice daily, were not statistically significant but there was a trend towards improved \nexercise capacity in the group treated with 250 mg twice daily. \n \nThe improvement in walk distance was apparent after 4 weeks of treatment, was clearly evident after \n8 weeks of treatment and was maintained for up to 28 weeks of double-blind treatment in a subset of \nthe patient population. \n \nIn a retrospective responder analysis based on change in walking distance, WHO functional class and \ndyspnoea of the 95 patients randomised to bosentan 125 mg twice daily in the placebo-controlled \nstudies, it was found that at week 8, 66 patients had improved, 22 were stable and 7 had deteriorated. \nOf the 22 patients stable at week 8, 6 improved at week 12/16 and 4 deteriorated compared with \nbaseline. Of the 7 patients who deteriorated at week 8, 3 improved at week 12/16 and 4 deteriorated \ncompared with baseline. \n \nInvasive haemodynamic parameters were assessed in the first study only. Treatment with bosentan led \nto a significant increase in cardiac index associated with a significant reduction in pulmonary artery \npressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and mean right atrial pressure. \n \nA reduction in symptoms of PAH was observed with bosentan treatment. Dyspnoea measurement \nduring walk tests showed an improvement in bosentan-treated patients. In the AC-052-352 study, 92% \nof the 213 patients were classified at baseline as WHO functional class III and 8% as class IV. \nTreatment with bosentan led to a WHO functional class improvement in 42.4% of patients (placebo \n30.4%). The overall change in WHO functional class during both studies was significantly better \namong bosentan-treated patients as compared with placebo-treated patients. Treatment with bosentan \nwas associated with a significant reduction in the rate of clinical worsening compared with placebo at \n28 weeks (10.7% vs 37.1%, respectively; p = 0.0015). \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled study (AC-052-364 [EARLY]), \n185 PAH patients in WHO functional class II (mean baseline 6-minute walk distance of 435 metres) \nreceived bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by 125 mg twice daily (n = 93), or \nplacebo (n = 92) for 6 months. Enrolled patients were PAH-treatment-naïve (n = 156) or on a stable \ndose of sildenafil (n = 29). The co-primary endpoints were percentage change from baseline in \npulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance to Month 6 \nversus placebo. The table below illustrates the pre-specified protocol analyses. \n \n PVR (dyn.sec/cm5) 6-Minute Walk Distance (m) \n Placebo (n=88) Bosentan (n=80) Placebo (n=91) Bosentan (n=86) \nBaseline (BL); mean (SD) 802 (365) 851 (535) 431 (92) 443 (83) \nChange from BL; mean (SD) 128 (465) −69 (475) −8 (79) 11 (74) \nTreatment effects −22.6% 19 \n95% CL −34, −10 −4, 42 \nP-value < 0.0001 0.0758 \nCL = confidence limit; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance; SD = standard deviation. \n \nTreatment with bosentan was associated with a reduction in the rate of clinical worsening, defined as a \ncomposite of symptomatic progression, hospitalisation for PAH and death, compared with placebo \n(proportional risk reduction 77%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 20–94%, p = 0.0114). The treatment \neffect was driven by improvement in the component symptomatic progression. There was one \n\n\n\n16 \n\nhospitalisation related to PAH worsening in the bosentan group and three hospitalisations in the \nplacebo group. Only one death occurred in each treatment group during the 6-month double-blind \nstudy period, therefore no conclusion can be drawn on survival. \n \nLong-term data were generated from all 173 patients who were treated with bosentan in the controlled \nphase and/or were switched from placebo to bosentan in the open-label extension phase of the EARLY \nstudy. The mean duration of exposure to bosentan treatment was 3.6 ± 1.8 years (up to 6.1 years), with \n73% of patients treated for at least 3 years and 62% for at least 4 years. Patients could receive \nadditional PAH treatment as required in the open-label extension. The majority of patients were \ndiagnosed with idiopathic or heritable PAH (61%). Overall, 78% of patients remained in WHO \nfunctional class II. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were 90% and 85% at 3 and 4 years after the \nstart of treatment, respectively. At the same timepoints, 88% and 79% of patients remained free from \nPAH worsening (defined as all-cause death, lung transplantation, atrial septostomy or start of \nintravenous or subcutaneous prostanoid treatment). The relative contributions of previous placebo \ntreatment in the double-blind phase and of other medications started during the open-label extension \nperiod are unknown. \n \nIn a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AC-052-405 \n[BREATHE-5]), patients with PAH WHO functional class III and Eisenmenger physiology associated \nwith congenital heart disease received bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 125 mg twice \ndaily for a further 12 weeks (n = 37, of whom 31 had a predominantly right to left, bidirectional \nshunt). The primary objective was to show that bosentan did not worsen hypoxaemia. After 16 weeks, \nthe mean oxygen saturation was increased in the bosentan group by 1.0% (95% CI –0.7%–2.8%) as \ncompared to the placebo group (n = 17), showing that bosentan did not worsen hypoxaemia. The mean \npulmonary vascular resistance was significantly reduced in the bosentan group (with a predominant \neffect observed in the subgroup of patients with bidirectional intracardiac shunt). After 16 weeks, the \nmean placebo-corrected increase in 6-minute walk distance was 53 metres (p = 0.0079), reflecting \nimprovement in exercise capacity. Twenty-six patients continued to receive bosentan in the 24-week \nopen-label extension phase (AC-052-409) of the BREATHE-5 study (mean duration of treatment = \n24.4 ± 2.0 weeks) and, in general, efficacy was maintained. \n \nAn open-label, non-comparative study (AC-052-362 [BREATHE-4]) was performed in 16 patients \nwith WHO functional class III PAH associated with HIV infection. Patients were treated with \nbosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by 125 mg twice daily for a further 12 weeks. \nAfter 16 weeks’ treatment, there were significant improvements from baseline in exercise capacity: the \nmean increase in 6-minute walk distance was 91.4 metres from 332.6 metres on average at baseline \n(p < 0.001). No formal conclusion can be drawn regarding the effects of bosentan on antiretroviral \ndrug efficacy (see also section 4.4). \n \nThere are no studies to demonstrate beneficial effects of STAYVEER treatment on survival. However, \nlong-term vital status was recorded for all 235 patients who were treated with bosentan in the two \npivotal placebo-controlled studies (AC-052-351 and AC-052-352) and/or their two uncontrolled, \nopen-label extensions. The mean duration of exposure to bosentan was 1.9 years ± 0.7 years (min: \n0.1 years; max: 3.3 years) and patients were observed for a mean of 2.0 ± 0.6 years. The majority of \npatients were diagnosed as primary pulmonary hypertension (72%) and were in WHO functional class \nIII (84%). In this total population, Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were 93% and 84% 1 and 2 \nyears after the start of treatment with bosentan, respectively. Survival estimates were lower in the \nsubgroup of patients with PAH secondary to systemic sclerosis. The estimates may have been \ninfluenced by the initiation of epoprostenol treatment in 43/235 patients. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nStudies performed in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nBREATHE-3 (AC-052-356) \nBosentan film-coated tablets were evaluated in an open-label uncontrolled study in 19 paediatric \npatients with PAH aged 3 to 15 years. This study was primarily designed as a pharmacokinetic study \n(see section 5.2). Patients had primary pulmonary hypertension (10 patients) or PAH related to \ncongenital heart diseases (9 patients) and were in WHO functional class II (n = 15, 79%) or class III \n(n = 4, 21%) at baseline. Patients were divided into three body-weight groups and dosed with bosentan \nat approximately 2 mg/kg twice daily for 12 weeks. Half of the patients in each group were already \nbeing treated with intravenous epoprostenol and the dose of epoprostenol remained constant for the \nduration of the study. \n \nHaemodynamics were measured in 17 patients. The mean increase from baseline in cardiac index was \n0.5 L/min/m2, the mean decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 8 mmHg, and the mean \ndecrease in PVR was 389 dyn·sec·cm-5. These haemodynamic improvements from baseline were \nsimilar with or without co-administration of epoprostenol. Changes in exercise test parameters at week \n12 from baseline were highly variable and none were significant. \n \nFUTURE 1/2 (AC-052-365/AC-052-367) \nFUTURE 1 was an open-label, uncontrolled study that was conducted with the dispersible tablet \nformulation of bosentan administered at a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg twice daily to 36 patients from \n2 to 11 years of age. It was primarily designed as a pharmacokinetic study (see section 5.2). At \nbaseline, patients had idiopathic (31 patients [86%]) or familial (5 patients [14%]) PAH, and were in \nWHO functional class II (n = 23, 64%) or class III (n = 13, 36%). In the FUTURE 1 study, the median \nexposure to study treatment was 13.1 weeks (range: 8.4 to 21.1). 33 of these patients were provided \nwith continued treatment with bosentan dispersible tablets at a dose of 4 mg/kg twice daily in the \nFUTURE 2 uncontrolled extension phase for a median overall treatment duration of 2.3 years (range: \n0.2 to 5.0 years). At baseline in FUTURE 1, 9 patients were taking epoprostenol. 9 patients were \nnewly initiated on PAH-specific medication during the study. The Kaplan-Meier event-free estimate \nfor worsening of PAH (death, lung transplantation, or hospitalisation for PAH worsening) at 2 years \nwas 78.9%. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival at 2 years was 91.2%. \n \nFUTURE 3 (AC-052-373) \nIn this open-label randomised study with the bosentan 32 mg dispersible tablet formulation, 64 \nchildren with stable PAH from 3 months to 11 years of age were randomised to 24 weeks’ bosentan \ntreatment 2 mg/kg twice daily (n = 33) or 2 mg/kg three times daily (n = 31). 43 (67.2%) were ≥ 2 \nyears to 11 years old, 15 (23.4%) were between 1 and 2 years old, and 6 (9.4%) were between 3 \nmonths and 1 year old. The study was primarily designed as a pharmacokinetic study (see section 5.2), \nand efficacy endpoints were only exploratory. The aetiology of PAH, according to Dana Point \nclassification, included idiopathic PAH (46%), heritable PAH (3%), associated PAH after corrective \ncardiac surgery (38%), and PAH related to congenital heart disease associated with systemic-to-\npulmonary shunts, including Eisenmenger syndrome (13%). Patients were in WHO functional class I \n(n = 19, 29 %), class II (n = 27, 42%) or class III (n = 18, 28%) at start of study treatment. At study \nentry, patients were treated with PAH medications (most frequently phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor \n[sildenafil] alone [35.9%], bosentan alone [10.9%], and a combination of bosentan, iloprost, and \nsildenafil [10.9%]) and continued their PAH treatment during the study. \n \nAt study start, less than half of the patients included (45.3% [29/64]) had bosentan treatment alone not \ncombined with other PAH medication. 40.6% (26/64) remained on bosentan monotherapy during the \n24 weeks of study treatment without experiencing PAH worsening. The analysis on the global \npopulation included (64 patients) showed that the majority had remained at least stable (i.e., without \ndeterioration) based on non-paediatric-specific WHO functional class assessment (97% twice daily, \n100% three times daily) and physician’s global clinical impression (94% twice daily, 93% three times \n\n\n\n18 \n\ndaily) during the treatment period. The Kaplan-Meier event-free estimate for worsening of PAH \n(death, lung transplantation, or hospitalisation for PAH worsening) at 24 weeks was 96.9% and 96.7% \nin the twice daily and three times daily groups, respectively. \n \nThere was no evidence of any clinical benefit with 2 mg/kg three times daily as compared to 2 mg/kg \ntwice daily dosing. \n \nStudy performed in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN): \n \nFUTURE 4 (AC-052-391) \nThis was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study in pre-term or term neonates \n(gestational age 36–42 weeks) with PPHN. Patients with suboptimal response to inhaled nitric oxide \n(iNO) despite at least 4 hours of continuous treatment were treated with bosentan dispersible tablets at \n2 mg/kg twice daily (N = 13) or placebo (N = 8) via nasogastric tube as add-on therapy on top of iNO \nuntil complete weaning of iNO or until treatment failure (defined as need for extra-corporeal \nmembrane oxygenation [ECMO] or initiation of alternative pulmonary vasodilator), and for a \nmaximum of 14 days. \n \nThe median exposure to study treatment was 4.5 (range: 0.5–10.0) days in the bosentan group and 4.0 \n(range: 2.5–6.5) days in the placebo group. \n \nThe results did not indicate an additional benefit of bosentan in this population: \n• The median time to complete weaning from iNO was 3.7 days (95% confidence limits [CLs] \n\n1.17, 6.95) on bosentan and 2.9 days (95% CLs 1.26, 4.23) on placebo (p = 0.34). \n• The median time to complete weaning from mechanical ventilation was 10.8 days (95% CLs \n\n3.21, 12.21 days) on bosentan and 8.6 days (95% CLs 3.71, 9.66 days) on placebo (p = 0.24). \n• One patient in the bosentan group had treatment failure (need for ECMO as per protocol \n\ndefinition), which was declared based on increasing Oxygenation Index values within 8 h after \nthe first study drug dose. This patient recovered within the 60-day follow-up period. \n\n \nCombination with epoprostenol \nThe combination of bosentan and epoprostenol has been investigated in two studies: AC-052-355 \n(BREATHE-2) and AC-052-356 (BREATHE-3). AC-052-355 was a multi-centre, randomised, \ndouble-blind, parallel-group study of bosentan versus placebo in 33 patients with severe PAH who \nwere receiving concomitant epoprostenol therapy. AC-052-356 was an open-label, uncontrolled study; \n10 of the 19 paediatric patients were on concomitant bosentan and epoprostenol therapy during the 12-\nweek study. The safety profile of the combination was not different from the one expected with each \ncomponent and the combination therapy was well tolerated in children and adults. The clinical benefit \nof the combination has not been demonstrated. \n \nSystemic sclerosis with digital ulcer disease \nTwo randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted in 122 \n(study AC-052-401 [RAPIDS-1]) and 190 (study AC-052-331 [RAPIDS-2]) adult patients with \nsystemic sclerosis and digital ulcer disease (either ongoing digital ulcers or a history of digital ulcers \nwithin the previous year). In study AC-052-331, patients had to have at least one digital ulcer of recent \nonset, and across the two studies 85% of patients had ongoing digital ulcer disease at baseline. After \n4 weeks of bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily, the maintenance dose studied in both these studies was \n125 mg twice daily. The duration of double-blind therapy was 16 weeks in study AC-052-401, and \n24 weeks in study AC-052-331. \n \nBackground treatments for systemic sclerosis and digital ulcers were permitted if they remained \nconstant for at least 1 month prior to the start of treatment and during the double-blind study period. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nThe number of new digital ulcers from baseline to study endpoint was a primary endpoint in both \nstudies. Treatment with bosentan resulted in fewer new digital ulcers for the duration of therapy, \ncompared with placebo. In study AC-052-401, during 16 weeks of double-blind therapy, patients in \nthe bosentan group developed a mean of 1.4 new digital ulcers vs 2.7 new digital ulcers in the placebo \ngroup (p = 0.0042). In study AC-052-331, during 24 weeks of double-blind therapy, the corresponding \nfigures were 1.9 vs 2.7 new digital ulcers, respectively (p = 0.0351). In both studies, patients on \nbosentan were less likely to develop multiple new digital ulcers during the study and took longer to \ndevelop each successive new digital ulcer than did those on placebo. The effect of bosentan on \nreduction of the number of new digital ulcers was more pronounced in patients with multiple digital \nulcers. \n \nNo effect of bosentan on time to healing of digital ulcers was observed in either study. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bosentan have mainly been documented in healthy subjects. Limited data in \npatients show that the exposure to bosentan in adult PAH patients is approximately 2-fold greater than \nin healthy adult subjects. \n \nIn healthy subjects, bosentan displays dose- and time-dependent pharmacokinetics. Clearance and \nvolume of distribution decrease with increased intravenous doses and increase with time. After oral \nadministration, the systemic exposure is proportional to dose up to 500 mg. At higher oral doses, Cmax \nand AUC increase less than proportionally to the dose. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIn healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability of bosentan is approximately 50% and is not affected \nby food. The maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 3–5 hours. \n \nDistribution \n \nBosentan is highly bound (> 98%) to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Bosentan does not penetrate \ninto erythrocytes. \n \nA volume of distribution (Vss) of about 18 litres was determined after an intravenous dose of 250 mg. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nAfter a single intravenous dose of 250 mg, the clearance was 8.2 L/h. The terminal elimination half-\nlife (t1/2) is 5.4 hours. \n \nUpon multiple dosing, plasma concentrations of bosentan decrease gradually to 50–65% of those seen \nafter single dose administration. This decrease is probably due to auto-induction of metabolising liver \nenzymes. Steady-state conditions are reached within 3–5 days. \n \nBosentan is eliminated by biliary excretion following metabolism in the liver by the cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Less than 3% of an administered oral dose is recovered in urine. \n \nBosentan forms three metabolites and only one of these is pharmacologically active. This metabolite is \nmainly excreted unchanged via the bile. In adult patients, the exposure to the active metabolite is \ngreater than in healthy subjects. In patients with evidence of the presence of cholestasis, the exposure \nto the active metabolite may be increased. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nBosentan is an inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and possibly also of CYP2C19 and the \nP-glycoprotein. In vitro, bosentan inhibits the bile salt export pump in hepatocyte cultures. \n \nIn vitro data demonstrated that bosentan had no relevant inhibitory effect on the CYP isoenzymes \ntested (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Consequently, bosentan is not expected to \nincrease the plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by these isoenzymes. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nBased on the investigated range of each variable, it is not expected that the pharmacokinetics of \nbosentan will be influenced by gender, body weight, race, or age in the adult population to any \nrelevant extent. \n \nChildren \nPharmacokinetics were studied in paediatric patients in 4 clinical studies (BREATHE-3, FUTURE 1, \nFUTURE-3 and FUTURE-4; see section 5.1). Due to limited data in children below 2 years of age, \npharmacokinetics remain not well characterised in this age category. \n \nStudy AC-052-356 (BREATHE-3) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple oral doses of \nthe film-coated tablet formulation of bosentan in 19 children aged from 3 to 15 years with PAH who \nwere dosed on the basis of body weight with 2 mg/kg twice daily. In this study, the exposure to \nbosentan decreased with time in a manner consistent with the known auto-induction properties of \nbosentan. The mean AUC (CV%) values of bosentan in paediatric patients treated with 31.25, 62.5 or \n125 mg twice daily were 3,496 (49), 5,428 (79), and 6,124 (27) ng·h/mL, respectively, and were lower \nthan the value of 8,149 (47) ng·h/mL observed in adult patients with PAH receiving 125 mg twice \ndaily. At steady state, the systemic exposures in paediatric patients weighing 10–20 kg, 20–40 kg and \n> 40 kg were 43%, 67% and 75%, respectively, of the adult systemic exposure. \n \nIn study AC-052-365 (FUTURE 1), dispersible tablets were administered in 36 PAH children aged \nfrom 2 to 11 years. No dose proportionality was observed, as steady-state bosentan plasma \nconcentrations and AUCs were similar at oral doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg (AUCτ: 3,577 ng·h/mL and \n3,371 ng·h/mL for 2 mg/kg twice daily and 4 mg/kg twice daily, respectively). The average exposure \nto bosentan in these paediatric patients was about half the exposure in adult patients at the 125 mg \ntwice daily maintenance dose but showed a large overlap with the exposures in adults. \n \nIn study AC-052-373 (FUTURE 3), using dispersible tablets, the exposure to bosentan in the patients \ntreated with 2 mg/kg twice daily was comparable to that in the FUTURE 1 study. In the overall \npopulation (n = 31), 2 mg/kg twice daily resulted in a daily exposure of 8,535 ng·h/mL; AUCτ was \n4,268 ng·h/mL (CV: 61%). In patients between 3 months and 2 years the daily exposure was 7,879 \nng·h/mL; AUCτ was 3,939 ng·h/mL (CV: 72%). In patients between 3 months and 1 year (n = 2) \nAUCτ was 5,914 ng·h/mL (CV: 85%), and in patients between 1 and 2 years (n = 7) AUCτ was \n3,507 ng·h/mL (CV: 70%). In the patients above 2 years (n = 22) the daily exposure was 8,820 \nng·h/mL; AUCτ was 4,410 ng·h/mL (CV: 58%). Dosing bosentan 2 mg/kg three times daily did not \nincrease exposure; daily exposure was 7,275 ng·h/mL (CV: 83%, n = 27). \n \nBased on the findings in studies BREATHE-3, FUTURE 1, and FUTURE-3, it appears that the \nexposure to bosentan reaches a plateau at lower doses in paediatric patients than in adults, and that \ndoses higher than 2 mg/kg twice daily (4 mg/kg twice daily or 2 mg/kg three times daily) will not \nresult in greater exposure to bosentan in paediatric patients. \n \nIn study AC-052-391 (FUTURE 4) conducted in neonates, bosentan concentrations increased slowly \nand continuously over the first dosing interval, resulting in low exposure (AUC0-12 in whole blood: \n164 ng·h/mL, n = 11). At steady state, AUCτ was 6,165 ng·h/mL (CV: 133%, n = 7), which is similar \n\n\n\n21 \n\nto the exposure observed in adult PAH patients receiving 125 mg twice daily and taking into account a \nblood/plasma distribution ratio of 0.6. \n \nThe consequences of these findings regarding hepatotoxicity are unknown. Gender and concomitant \nuse of intravenous epoprostenol had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of bosentan. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh class A) no relevant changes in the \npharmacokinetics have been observed. The steady-state AUC of bosentan was 9% higher and the AUC \nof the active metabolite, Ro 48-5033, was 33% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment than in \nhealthy volunteers. \n \nThe impact of moderately impaired liver function (Child-Pugh class B) on the pharmacokinetics of \nbosentan and its primary metabolite Ro 48-5033 was investigated in a study including 5 patients with \npulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension and Child-Pugh class B hepatic \nimpairment, and 3 patients with PAH from other causes and normal liver function. In the patients with \nChild-Pugh class B liver impairment, the mean (95% CI) steady-state AUC of bosentan was 360 (212–\n613) ng⋅h/mL, i.e., 4.7 times higher, and the mean (95% CI) AUC of the active metabolite Ro 48-5033 \nwas 106 (58.4–192) ng⋅h/mL, i.e., 12.4 times higher than in the patients with normal liver function \n(bosentan: mean [95% CI] AUC: 76.1 [9.07–638] ng⋅h/mL; Ro 48-5033: mean [95% CI] AUC 8.57 \n[1.28–57.2] ng⋅h/ml). Though the number of patients included was limited and with high variability, \nthese data indicate a marked increase in the exposure to bosentan and its primary metabolite Ro 48-\n5033 in patients with moderate liver function impairment (Child-Pugh class B). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bosentan have not been studied in patients with Child-Pugh class C hepatic \nimpairment. STAYVEER is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, \ni.e., Child-Pugh class B or C (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15–30 mL/min), plasma concentrations \nof bosentan decreased by approximately 10%. Plasma concentrations of bosentan metabolites \nincreased about 2-fold in these patients as compared with subjects with normal renal function. No dose \nadjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. There is no specific clinical experience in \npatients undergoing dialysis. Based on physicochemical properties and the high degree of protein \nbinding, bosentan is not expected to be removed from the circulation by dialysis to any significant \nextent (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nA 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice showed an increased combined incidence of hepatocellular \nadenomas and carcinomas in males, but not in females, at plasma concentrations about 2 to 4 times the \nplasma concentrations achieved at the therapeutic dose in humans. In rats, oral administration of \nbosentan for 2 years produced a small, significant increase in the combined incidence of thyroid \nfollicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in males, but not in females, at plasma concentrations about 9 \nto 14 times the plasma concentrations achieved at the therapeutic dose in humans. Bosentan was \nnegative in tests for genotoxicity. There was evidence of a mild thyroid hormonal imbalance induced \nby bosentan in rats. However, there was no evidence of bosentan affecting thyroid function (thyroxine, \nTSH) in humans. \n \nThe effect of bosentan on mitochondrial function is unknown. \n \nBosentan has been shown to be teratogenic in rats at plasma levels higher than 1.5 times the plasma \nconcentrations achieved at the therapeutic dose in humans. Teratogenic effects, including \n\n\n\n22 \n\nmalformations of the head and face and of the major vessels, were dose dependent. The similarities of \nthe pattern of malformations observed with other ET receptor antagonists and in ET knock-out mice \nindicate a class effect. Appropriate precautions must be taken for women of childbearing potential (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nDevelopment of testicular tubular atrophy and impaired fertility has been linked with chronic \nadministration of endothelin receptor antagonists in rodents. \n \nIn fertility studies in male and female rats, no effects on sperm count, motility and viability, or on \nmating performance or fertility were observed at exposures that were 21 and 43 times the expected \ntherapeutic level in humans, respectively; nor was there any adverse effect on the development of the \npre-implantation embryo or on implantation. \n \nSlightly increased incidence of testicular tubular atrophy was observed in rats given bosentan orally at \ndoses as low as 125 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] and \nthe lowest doses tested) for two years but not at doses as high as 1,500 mg/kg/day (about 50 times the \nMRHD) for 6 months. In a juvenile rat toxicity study, where rats were treated from Day 4 post partum \nup to adulthood, decreased absolute weights of testes and epididymides, and reduced number of sperm \nin epididymides were observed after weaning. The NOAEL was 21 times (at Day 21 post partum) and \n2.3 times (Day 69 post partum) the human therapeutic exposure, respectively. \n \nHowever, no effects on general development, growth, sensory, cognitive function and reproductive \nperformance were detected at 7 (males) and 19 (females) times the human therapeutic exposure at Day \n21 post partum. At adult age (Day 69 post partum), no effects of bosentan were detected at 1.3 (males) \nand 2.6 (females) times the therapeutic exposure in children with PAH. \n \n \n6.

Therefore, you must not \ntake STAYVEER if you are pregnant and you must also not become pregnant \nwhile taking STAYVEER. \n\nMoreover, if you are suffering from pulmonary hypertension disease, the \noccurrence of a pregnancy can severely deteriorate the symptoms of your \ndisease. If you suspect you may be pregnant, tell your doctor or gynaecologist. \n\nContraception \nBirth control based on hormones – such as oral contraceptives or birth control \npills, hormone injections, implants, or birth control skin patches don’t reliably \nprevent pregnancy in women who are taking STAYVEER. You need to use a \nbarrier form of birth control – like a condom, diaphragm or vaginal sponge – in \naddition to any of these kinds of hormonal birth control. Be sure to discuss any \nquestions you may have with your doctor or your gynaecologist – complete the \ndetails on the back of this card and take it to your doctor or gynaecologist at \nyour next visit. \n\nYou should have a pregnancy test before initiation of STAYVEER and every \nmonth during the treatment even if you think that you are not pregnant. \n\nDate of first monthly test: _________________________________ \n\n((Inside 2)) \nBlood Test for Liver Function \nSome patients taking STAYVEER were found to have abnormal liver function \ntests.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nSTAYVEER 62.5 mg film-coated tablets \nBosentan \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What STAYVEER is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take STAYVEER \n3. How to take STAYVEER \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store STAYVEER \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What STAYVEER is and what it is used for \n \nSTAYVEER tablets contain bosentan, which blocks a naturally occurring hormone called endothelin-1 \n(ET-1), which causes blood vessels to narrow. STAYVEER therefore causes blood vessels to expand and \nbelongs to the class of medicines called “endothelin receptor antagonists”. \n \nSTAYVEER is used to treat: \n• Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): PAH is a disease of severe narrowing of the blood \n\nvessels in the lungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) \nthat carry blood from the heart to the lungs. This pressure reduces the amount of oxygen that can \nget into the blood in the lungs, making physical activity more difficult. STAYVEER widens the \npulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. This lowers the \nblood pressure and relieves the symptoms. \n\n \nSTAYVEER is used to treat patients with class III PAH to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry \nout physical activity) and symptoms. The ‘class’ reflects the seriousness of the disease: ‘class III’ involves \nmarked limitation of physical activity. Some improvements have also been shown in patients with class II \nPAH. ‘Class II’ involves slight limitation of physical activity. The PAH for which STAYVEER is \nindicated can be: \n• primary (with no identified cause or familial); \n• caused by scleroderma (also called systemic sclerosis, a disease where there is abnormal growth of \n\nthe connective tissue that supports the skin and other organs); \n• caused by congenital (inborn) heart defects with shunts (abnormal passageways) causing abnormal \n\nflow of blood through the heart and lungs. \n \n• Digital ulcers: (sores on the fingers and toes) in adult patients with a condition called scleroderma. \n\nSTAYVEER reduces the number of new finger and toe ulcers that appear. \n \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take STAYVEER \n \nDo not take STAYVEER \n• if you are allergic to bosentan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• if you have liver problems (ask your doctor) \n• if you are pregnant, or could get pregnant because you are not using reliable contraceptive \n\nmethods. Please read the information under “Contraceptives” and “Other medicines and \nSTAYVEER” \n\n• if you are taking cyclosporine A (a medicine used after a transplant or to treat psoriasis) \n \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTests your doctor will do before treatment \n• a blood test to check your liver function \n• a blood test to check for anaemia (low haemoglobin) \n• a pregnancy test if you are a woman of childbearing potential \nSome patients taking STAYVEER have been found to have abnormal liver function tests and anaemia \n(low haemoglobin). \n \nTests your doctor will do during treatment \nDuring treatment with STAYVEER, your doctor will arrange for regular blood tests to check for changes \nin your liver function and haemoglobin level. \n \nFor all these tests please refer also to the Patient Alert Card (inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets). It is \nimportant that you have these regular blood tests as long as you are taking STAYVEER. We suggest you \nwrite the date of your most recent test and also of your next test (ask your doctor for the date) on the \nPatient Alert Card, to help you remember when your next test is due. \n \nBlood tests for liver function \nThese will be done every month for the duration of treatment with STAYVEER. After an increase in dose \nan additional test will be done after 2 weeks. \n \nBlood tests for anaemia \nThese will be done every month for the first 4 months of treatment, then every 3 months after that, as \npatients taking STAYVEER may get anaemia. \n \nIf these results are abnormal, your doctor may decide to reduce your dose or stop treatment with \nSTAYVEER and to perform further tests to investigate the cause. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nSTAYVEER is not recommended in paediatric patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer \ndisease. Please see also section 3. How to take STAYVEER. \n \nOther medicines and STAYVEER \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are \ntaking: \n• cyclosporine A (a medicine used after transplants and to treat psoriasis), which must not be used \n\ntogether with STAYVEER. \n• sirolimus or tacrolimus, which are medicines used after transplants, as these are not recommended \n\nto be used together with STAYVEER. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n• glibenclamide (a diabetes medicine), rifampicin (a tuberculosis medicine), fluconazole (a medicine \nagainst fungal infections), ketoconazole (a medicine used to treat Cushing’s syndrome), or \nnevirapine (an HIV medicine), as these medicines are not recommended to be used together with \nSTAYVEER. \n\n• other medicines for the treatment of HIV infection, which may require special monitoring if used \ntogether with STAYVEER. \n\n• hormonal contraceptives, which are not effective as the sole method of contraception when you take \nSTAYVEER. Inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets you will find a Patient Alert Card which you \nshould read carefully. Your doctor and/or gynaecologist will establish the contraception which is \nappropriate for you. \n\n• other medications for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension: sildenafil and tadalafil; \n• warfarin (an anticoagulant agent); \n• simvastatin (used to treat hypercholesterolaemia). \n \nDriving and using machines \nSTAYVEER has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \nSTAYVEER can induce hypotension (decrease of your blood pressure) which can make you feel dizzy, \naffect your vision and affect your ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, if you feel dizzy or that \nyour vision is blurred while taking STAYVEER, do not drive or operate any tools or machines. \n \nWomen of childbearing age \nDo NOT take STAYVEER if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n \nPregnancy tests \nSTAYVEER may harm unborn babies conceived before starting or during treatment. If you are a woman \nwho could become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start taking \nSTAYVEER, and regularly while you are taking STAYVEER. \n \nContraceptives \nIf it is possible that you could become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) while \nyou are taking STAYVEER. Your doctor or gynaecologist will advise you about reliable contraceptive \nmethods while taking STAYVEER. Because STAYVEER may make hormonal contraception (e.g., oral, \ninjection, implant, or skin patches) ineffective, this method on its own is not reliable. Therefore, if you use \nhormonal contraceptives you must also use a barrier method (e.g., female condom, diaphragm, \ncontraceptive sponge, or your partner must also use a condom). Inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets \nyou will find a Patient Alert Card. You should complete this card and take it to your doctor at your next \nvisit so that your doctor or gynaecologist can assess whether you need additional or alternative reliable \ncontraceptive methods. Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended while you are taking STAYVEER and \nare of childbearing age. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking STAYVEER, or plan to \nbecome pregnant in the near future. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor immediately if you are breast-feeding. You are advised to stop breast-feeding if \nSTAYVEER is prescribed for you, because it is not known whether this medicine passes into breast milk. \n \nFertility \nIf you are a man taking STAYVEER, it is possible that this medicine may lower your sperm count. It \ncannot be excluded that this may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your doctor if you have any \nquestions or concerns about this. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nSTAYVEER contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take STAYVEER \n \nTreatment with STAYVEER should only be started and monitored by a doctor who has experience in the \ntreatment of PAH or systemic sclerosis. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nSTAYVEER with food and drink \nSTAYVEER can be taken with or without food. \n \nRecommended dose \n \nAdult \nThe treatment in adults is usually started for the first 4 weeks with 62.5 mg twice daily (morning and \nevening), from then your doctor will usually advise you to take a 125 mg tablet twice daily, depending on \nhow you react to STAYVEER. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe dose recommendation in children is only for PAH. For children aged 1 year and older, treatment with \nSTAYVEER is usually started with 2 mg per kg bodyweight twice daily (morning and evening). Your \ndoctor will advise you on your dosing. \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of STAYVEER is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor in \norder to find out whether your dose needs to be changed. \n \nHow to take STAYVEER \nTablets should be taken (morning and evening), swallowed with water. The tablets can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \nIf you take more STAYVEER than you should \nIf you take more tablets than you have been told to take, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take STAYVEER \nIf you forget to take STAYVEER, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your tablets \nat the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten tablets. \n \nIf you stop taking STAYVEER \nSuddenly stopping your treatment with STAYVEER may lead to your symptoms getting worse. Do not \nstop taking STAYVEER unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to reduce the dose over \na few days before stopping completely. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nThe most serious side effects with STAYVEER are \n• Abnormal liver function which may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Anaemia (low blood value) which may affect up to 1 in 10 people.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take STAYVEER \n3. How to take STAYVEER \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store STAYVEER \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What STAYVEER is and what it is used for \n \nSTAYVEER tablets contain bosentan, which blocks a naturally occurring hormone called endothelin-1 \n(ET-1), which causes blood vessels to narrow. STAYVEER therefore causes blood vessels to expand and \nbelongs to the class of medicines called “endothelin receptor antagonists”. \n \nSTAYVEER is used to treat: \n• Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): PAH is a disease of severe narrowing of the blood \n\nvessels in the lungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) \nthat carry blood from the heart to the lungs. This pressure reduces the amount of oxygen that can \nget into the blood in the lungs, making physical activity more difficult. STAYVEER widens the \npulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. This lowers the \nblood pressure and relieves the symptoms. \n\n \nSTAYVEER is used to treat patients with class III PAH to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry \nout physical activity) and symptoms. The ‘class’ reflects the seriousness of the disease: ‘class III’ involves \nmarked limitation of physical activity. Some improvements have also been shown in patients with class II \nPAH. ‘Class II’ involves slight limitation of physical activity. The PAH for which STAYVEER is \nindicated can be: \n• primary (with no identified cause or familial); \n• caused by scleroderma (also called systemic sclerosis, a disease where there is abnormal growth of \n\nthe connective tissue that supports the skin and other organs); \n• caused by congenital (inborn) heart defects with shunts (abnormal passageways) causing abnormal \n\nflow of blood through the heart and lungs. \n \n• Digital ulcers: (sores on the fingers and toes) in adult patients with a condition called scleroderma. \n\nSTAYVEER reduces the number of new finger and toe ulcers that appear. \n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take STAYVEER \n \nDo not take STAYVEER \n• if you are allergic to bosentan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• if you have liver problems (ask your doctor) \n• if you are pregnant, or could get pregnant because you are not using reliable contraceptive \n\nmethods. Please read the information under “Contraceptives” and “Other medicines and \nSTAYVEER” \n\n• if you are taking cyclosporine A (a medicine used after a transplant or to treat psoriasis) \n \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTests your doctor will do before treatment \n• a blood test to check your liver function \n• a blood test to check for anaemia (low haemoglobin) \n• a pregnancy test if you are a woman of childbearing potential \n• Some patients taking STAYVEER have been found to have abnormal liver function tests and \n\nanaemia (low haemoglobin). \n \nTests your doctor will do during treatment \nDuring treatment with STAYVEER, your doctor will arrange for regular blood tests to check for changes \nin your liver function and haemoglobin level. \n \nFor all these tests please refer also to the Patient Alert Card (inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets). It is \nimportant that you have these regular blood tests as long as you are taking STAYVEER. We suggest you \nwrite the date of your most recent test and also of your next test (ask your doctor for the date) on the \nPatient Alert Card, to help you remember when your next test is due. \n \nBlood tests for liver function \nThese will be done every month for the duration of treatment with STAYVEER. After an increase in dose \nan additional test will be done after 2 weeks. \n \nBlood tests for anaemia \nThese will be done every month for the first 4 months of treatment, then every 3 months after that, as \npatients taking STAYVEER may get anaemia. \n \nIf these results are abnormal, your doctor may decide to reduce your dose or stop treatment with \nSTAYVEER and to perform further tests to investigate the cause. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nSTAYVEER is not recommended in paediatric patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer \ndisease. Please see also section 3. How to take STAYVEER. \n \nOther medicines and STAYVEER \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are \ntaking: \n• cyclosporine A (a medicine used after transplants and to treat psoriasis), which must not be used \n\ntogether with STAYVEER. \n• sirolimus or tacrolimus, which are medicines used after transplants, as these are not recommended \n\nto be used together with STAYVEER. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n• glibenclamide (a diabetes medicine), rifampicin (a tuberculosis medicine), fluconazole (a medicine \nagainst fungal infections), ketoconazole (a medicine used to treat Cushing’s syndrome), or \nnevirapine (an HIV medicine), as these medicines are not recommended to be used together with \nSTAYVEER. \n\n• other medicines for the treatment of HIV infection, which may require special monitoring if used \ntogether with STAYVEER. \n\n• hormonal contraceptives, which are not effective as the sole method of contraception when you take \nSTAYVEER. Inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets you will find a Patient Alert Card which you \nshould read carefully. Your doctor and/or gynaecologist will establish the contraception which is \nappropriate for you. \n\n• other medications for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension: sildenafil and tadalafil; \n• warfarin (an anticoagulant agent); \n• simvastatin (used to treat hypercholesterolaemia).  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSTAYVEER has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \nSTAYVEER can induce hypotension (decrease of your blood pressure) which can make you feel dizzy, \naffect your vision and affect your ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, if you feel dizzy or that \nyour vision is blurred while taking STAYVEER, do not drive or operate any tools or machines. \n \nWomen of childbearing age \nDo NOT take STAYVEER if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n \nPregnancy tests \nSTAYVEER may harm unborn babies conceived before starting or during treatment. If you are a woman \nwho could become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start taking \nSTAYVEER, and regularly while you are taking STAYVEER. \n \nContraceptives \nIf it is possible that you could become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) while \nyou are taking STAYVEER. Your doctor or gynaecologist will advise you about reliable contraceptive \nmethods while taking STAYVEER. Because STAYVEER may make hormonal contraception (e.g., oral, \ninjection, implant, or skin patches) ineffective, this method on its own is not reliable. Therefore, if you use \nhormonal contraceptives you must also use a barrier method (e.g., female condom, diaphragm, \ncontraceptive sponge, or your partner must also use a condom). Inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets \nyou will find a Patient Alert Card. You should complete this card and take it to your doctor at your next \nvisit so that your doctor or gynaecologist can assess whether you need additional or alternative reliable \ncontraceptive methods. Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended while you are taking STAYVEER and \nare of childbearing age. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking STAYVEER, or plan to \nbecome pregnant in the near future. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor immediately if you are breast-feeding. You are advised to stop breast-feeding if \nSTAYVEER is prescribed for you, because it is not known whether this medicine passes into breast milk. \n \nFertility \nIf you are a man taking STAYVEER, it is possible that this medicine may lower your sperm count. It \ncannot be excluded that this may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your doctor if you have any \nquestions or concerns about this. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nSTAYVEER contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take STAYVEER \n \nTreatment with STAYVEER should only be started and monitored by a doctor who has experience in the \ntreatment of PAH or systemic sclerosis. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nSTAYVEER with food and drink \nSTAYVEER can be taken with or without food. \n \nRecommended dose \n \nAdult \nThe treatment in adults is usually started for the first 4 weeks with 62.5 mg twice daily (morning and \nevening), from then your doctor will usually advise you to take a 125 mg tablet twice daily, depending on \nhow you react to STAYVEER. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe dose recommendation in children is only for PAH. For children aged 1 year and older, treatment with \nSTAYVEER is usually started with 2 mg per kg bodyweight twice daily (morning and evening). Your \ndoctor will advise you on your dosing. \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of STAYVEER is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor in \norder to find out whether your dose needs to be changed. \n \nHow to take STAYVEER \nTablets should be taken (morning and evening), swallowed with water. The tablets can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \nIf you take more STAYVEER than you should \nIf you take more tablets than you have been told to take, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take STAYVEER \nIf you forget to take STAYVEER, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your tablets \nat the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten tablets. \n \nIf you stop taking STAYVEER \nSuddenly stopping your treatment with STAYVEER may lead to your symptoms getting worse. Do not \nstop taking STAYVEER unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to reduce the dose over \na few days before stopping completely. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nThe most serious side effects with STAYVEER are \n• Abnormal liver function which may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Anaemia (low blood value) which may affect up to 1 in 10 people. Anaemia may occasionally \n\nrequire blood transfusion \nYour liver and blood values will be monitored during treatment with STAYVEER (see section 2).
