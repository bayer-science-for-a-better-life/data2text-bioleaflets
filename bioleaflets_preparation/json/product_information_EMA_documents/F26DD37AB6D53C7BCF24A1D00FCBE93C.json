Incremental escalation of the infusion rate should be \nconsidered only in the absence of infusion reactions.\nTo facilitate administration, the first prescribed 16 mg/kg dose at Week 1 may be split over two \nconsecutive days i.e. 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 2 respectively, see Table 5 below.\n\nTable 5: Infusion rates for DARZALEX (16 mg/kg) administration\nDilution \nvolume\n\nInitial rate \n(first hour)\n\nRate Incrementa Maximum rate\n\nWeek 1 Infusion\nOption 1 (Single dose infusion)\n\nWeek 1 Day 1 (16 mg/kg) 1,000 mL 50 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour\nOption 2 (Split dose infusion)\n\nWeek 1 Day 1 (8 mg/kg) 500 mL 50 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour\nWeek 1 Day 2 (8 mg/kg) 500 mL 50 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour\n\nWeek 2 (16 mg/kg)infusionb 500 mL 50 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour\nSubsequent (Week 3 onwards, \n16 mg/kg) infusionsc\n\n500 mL 100 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour\n\na Incremental escalation of the infusion rate should be considered only in the absence of infusion reactions.\nb A dilution volume of 500 mL for the 16 mg/kg dose should be used only if there were no IRRs the previous week. \n\nOtherwise, use a dilution volume of 1,000 mL.\nc A modified initial rate (100 mL/hour) for subsequent infusions (i.e. Week 3 onwards) should only be used only if there \n\nwere no IRRs during the previous infusion. Otherwise, continue to use instructions indicated in the table for the \nWeek 2 infusion rate.\n\nManagement of infusion-related reactions\nPre-infusion medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions \n(IRRs) prior to treatment with DARZALEX.\n\nFor IRRs of any grade/severity, immediately interrupt the DARZALEX infusion and manage \nsymptoms.\n\nManagement of IRRs may further require reduction in the rate of infusion, or treatment \ndiscontinuation of DARZALEX as outlined below (see section 4.4).\n Grade 1-2 (mild to moderate): Once reaction symptoms resolve, the infusion should be resumed \n\nat no more than half the rate at which the IRR occurred. If the patient does not experience any \nfurther IRR symptoms, infusion rate escalation may be resumed at increments and intervals as \nclinically appropriate up to the maximum rate of 200 mL/hour (Table 5).\n\n Grade 3 (severe): Once reaction symptoms resolve, restarting of the infusion may be considered \nat no more than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the patient does not experience \nadditional symptoms, infusion rate escalation may be resumed at increments and intervals as \n\n\n\n5\n\nappropriate (Table 5). The procedure above should be repeated in the event of recurrence of \nGrade 3 symptoms. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX upon the third occurrence of a \nGrade 3 or greater infusion reaction.\n\n Grade 4 (life-threatening): Permanently discontinue DARZALEX treatment.\n\nMissed dose\nIf a planned dose of DARZALEX is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible and \nthe dosing schedule should be adjusted accordingly, maintaining the treatment interval.\n\nDose modifications\nNo dose reductions of DARZALEX are recommended. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery \nof blood cell counts in the event of haematological toxicity (see section 4.4). For information \nconcerning medicinal products given in combination with DARZALEX, see corresponding Summary \nof Product Characteristics.\n\nRecommended concomitant medicinal products\nPre-infusion medicinal product\nPre-infusion medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs to all patients 1-\n3 hours prior to every infusion of DARZALEX as follows:\n\n Corticosteroid (long-acting or intermediate-acting)\n- Monotherapy:\n\nMethylprednisolone 100 mg, or equivalent, administered intravenously. Following the \nsecond infusion, the dose of corticosteroid may be reduced (oral or intravenous\nmethylprednisolone 60 mg).\n\n- Combination therapy:\nDexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent), administered prior to every DARZALEX infusion.\nWhen dexamethasone is the background-regimen specific corticosteroid, the dexamethasone \ntreatment dose will instead serve as pre-infusion medicinal product on DARZALEX\ninfusion days (see section 5.1).\nDexamethasone is given intravenously prior to the first DARZALEX infusion and oral \nadministration may be considered prior to subsequent infusions. Additional background \nregimen specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) should not be taken on DARZALEX \ninfusion days when patients have received dexamethasone as a pre-infusion medicinal \nproduct.\n\n Antipyretics (oral paracetamol 650 to 1,000 mg)\n Antihistamine (oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent).\n\nPost-infusion medicinal product\nPost-infusion medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of delayed IRRs as \nfollows:\n\nMonotherapy:\nOral corticosteroid (20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose of an intermediate-acting or \nlong-acting corticosteroid in accordance with local standards) should be administered on each of\nthe two days following all infusions (beginning the day after the infusion).\nCombination therapy:\nConsider administering low-dose oral methylprednisolone (≤20 mg) or equivalent the day after \nthe DARZALEX infusion. However, if a background regimen-specific corticosteroid (e.g. \ndexamethasone, prednisone) is administered the day after the DARZALEX infusion, additional \npost-infusion medicinal products may not be needed (see section 5.1).\n\nAdditionally, for patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the use of \npost-infusion medicinal products including short and long acting bronchodilators, and inhaled \ncorticosteroids should be considered. Following the first four infusions, if the patient experiences no \nmajor IRRs, these inhaled post-infusion medicinal products may be discontinued at the discretion of \nthe physician.\n\n\n\n6\n\nProphylaxis for herpes zoster virus reactivation\nAnti-viral prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of herpes zoster virus reactivation.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nNo formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted.\nBased on population PK analyses, no dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of DARZALEX in children aged below 18 years of age have not been \nestablished.\nNo data are available (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\nDARZALEX is for intravenous use. It is administered as an intravenous infusion following dilution\nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. For instructions on dilution of the \nmedicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nDARZALEX can cause serious IRRs, including anaphylactic reactions (see section 4.8).\n\nAll patients should be monitored throughout the infusion for IRRs. For patients that experience any \nGrade IRRs, continue monitoring post-infusion until symptoms resolve.\n\nIn clinical studies, IRRs were reported in approximately half of all patients treated with DARZALEX.\n\nThe majority of IRRs occurred at the first infusion and were Grade 1-2 (see section 4.8). Four percent \nof all patients had an IRR at more than one infusion. Severe reactions have occurred, including \nbronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnoea, hypertension, laryngeal oedema and pulmonary oedema.\nSymptoms predominantly included nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, chills, vomiting and\nnausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus\nand hypotension (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients should be pre-medicated with antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids to reduce the \nrisk of IRRs prior to treatment with DARZALEX. DARZALEX infusion should be interrupted for\nIRRs of any severity and medical management/supportive treatment for IRRs should be instituted as \nneeded. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 IRRs, the infusion rate should be reduced when re-starting \n\n\n\n7\n\nthe infusion. If an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion reaction occurs, \nappropriate emergency resuscitation should be initiated immediately. DARZALEX therapy should be \ndiscontinued immediately and permanently (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n\nTo reduce the risk of delayed IRRs, oral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients \nfollowing DARZALEX infusions. Additionally the use of post-infusion medicinal products (e.g. \ninhaled corticosteroids, short and long acting bronchodilators) should be considered for patients with a \nhistory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to manage respiratory complications should they \noccur (see section 4.2).\n\nNeutropenia/Thrombocytopenia\nDARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy (see \nsection 4.8).\nComplete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically during treatment according to \nmanufacturer’s prescribing information for background therapies. Patients with neutropenia should be \nmonitored for signs of infection. DARZALEX delay may be required to allow recovery of blood cell \ncounts. No dose reduction of DARZALEX is recommended. Consider supportive care with \ntransfusions or growth factors.\n\nInterference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)\nDaratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a \npositive indirect Coombs test. Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test may persist for \nup to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. It should be recognised that daratumumab bound \nto RBCs may mask detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination \nof a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted.\n\nPatients should be typed and screened prior to starting daratumumab treatment. Phenotyping may be \nconsidered prior to starting daratumumab treatment as per local practice. Red blood cell genotyping is \nnot impacted by daratumumab and may be performed at any time.\n\nIn the event of a planned transfusion blood transfusion centres should be notified of this interference \nwith indirect antiglobulin tests (see section 4.5). If an emergency transfusion is required, \nnon-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given per local blood bank practices.\n\nInterference with determination of complete response\nDaratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum \nprotein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of \nendogenous M-protein (see section 4.5). This interference can impact the determination of complete \nresponse and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation\nHepatitis B virus reactivation, in some cases fatal, has been reported in patients treated with \nDARZALEX. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with\nDARZALEX.\nFor patients with evidence of positive HBV serology, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV \nreactivation during, and for at least six months following the end of DARZALEX treatment. Manage \npatients according to current clinical guidelines. Consider consulting a hepatitis disease expert as\nclinically indicated.\nIn patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on DARZALEX, suspend treatment with \nDARZALEX and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of DARZALEX treatment in patients\nwhose HBV reactivation is adequately controlled should be discussed with physicians with expertise \nin managing HBV.\n\nExcipients\nEach 5 mL and 20 mL vial of DARZALEX contains 0.4 mmol and 1.6 mmol (9.3 mg and 37.3 mg) \nsodium, respectively. This corresponds to 0.46% and 1.86% of the WHO recommended maximum \ndaily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult, respectively.\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nAs an IgG1қ monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact \ndaratumumab are unlikely to represent major elimination routes. As such, variations in \ndrug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. Due to the \nhigh affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is not anticipated to alter drug-metabolising \nenzymes.\n\nClinical pharmacokinetic assessments of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide,\npomalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone indicated no clinically-relevant drug-drug \ninteraction between daratumumab and these small molecule medicinal products.\n\nInterference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)\nDaratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including antibody \nscreening and cross matching (see section 4.4). Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include \ntreating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally \nvalidated methods. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, \nKell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated \nRBCs. Alternatively, phenotyping or genotyping may also be considered (see section 4.4).\n\nInterference with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests\nDaratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) \nassays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). This can lead to false \npositive SPE and IFE assay results for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial \nassessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In \npatients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected, \nconsider using a validated daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any \nremaining endogenous M protein in the patient’s serum, to facilitate determination of a complete\nresponse.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception\nWomen of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during, and for 3 months after\ncessation of daratumumab treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no human or animal data to assess the risk of daratumumab use during pregnancy. IgG1 \nmonoclonal antibodies are known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore \ndaratumumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit of treatment to the woman is \nconsidered to outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking \nthis medicine, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether daratumumab is excreted into human or animal milk.\nMaternal IgG is excreted in human milk, but does not enter the neonatal and newborn/infant \ncirculations in substantial amounts as they are degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed.\n\nThe effect of daratumumab on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision should be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue DARZALEX therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\n\n\n9\n\nFertility\nNo data are available to determine potential effects of daratumumab on fertility in males or females\n(see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDARZALEX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue \nhas been reported in patients taking daratumumab and this should be taken into account when driving \nor using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions of any grade ≥20% were IRRs, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, pyrexia, dyspnoea, cough, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, oedema peripheral,\nasthenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory tract infection. Serious adverse reactions \nwere sepsis, pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pulmonary oedema, influenza,\npyrexia, dehydration, diarrhoea and atrial fibrillation.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 6 summarises the adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving DARZALEX. The data \nreflects exposure to DARZALEX (16 mg/kg) in 2066 patients with multiple myeloma including \n1910 patients who received DARZALEX in combination with background regimens and 156 patients \nwho received DARZALEX as monotherapy. Post-marketing adverse reactions are also included.\n\nIn Study MMY3006, the number of CD34+ cell yield was numerically lower in the D-VTd arm\ncompared with the VTd arm (Median: D-VTd: 6.3 x 106/kg; VTd 8.9 x 106/kg) and among those who \ncompleted mobilisation, more patients in the D-VTd group received plerixafor compared to those in \nthe VTd arm (D-VTd: 21.7%; VTd: 7.9%). The rates of engraftment and haematopoietic reconstitution \nwas similar among the transplanted subjects in the D-VTd and VTd arms (D-VTd: 99.8%; VTd: \n99.6%; as measured by the recovery of neutrophils > 0.5 x 109/L, leukocytes > 1.0 x 109/L, and \nplatelets > 50 x 109/L without transfusion).\n\nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).

Less than 1% of patients had a Grade 3/4\nIRR with the Week 2 or subsequent infusions.\n\nThe median time to onset of a reaction was 1.5 hours (range: 0 to 72.8 hours). The incidence of \ninfusion modifications due to reactions was 36%. Median durations of 16 mg/kg infusions for the 1st\n\nWeek, 2nd Week and subsequent infusions were approximately 7, 4 and 3 hours respectively.\nSevere IRRs included bronchospasm, dyspnoea, laryngeal oedema, pulmonary oedema, hypoxia, and \nhypertension. Other adverse IRRs included nasal congestion, cough, chills, throat irritation, vomiting \nand nausea (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (Study MMY3006) for a median of \n3.75 (range: 2.4; 6.9) months, upon re-initiation of DARZALEX the incidence of IRRs was 11% at \nfirst infusion following ASCT. Infusion rate/dilution volume used upon re-initiation was that used for \nthe last DARZALEX infusion prior to interruption due to ASCT. IRRs occurring at re-initiation of \nDARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3/4: <1%) \nwith those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions.\n\nIn Study MMY1001, patients receiving daratumumab combination treatment (n=97) were \nadministered the first 16 mg/kg daratumumab dose at Week 1 split over two days i.e. 8 mg/kg on \nDay 1 and Day 2 respectively. The incidence of any grade IRRs was 42%, with 36% of patients \nexperiencing IRRs on Day 1 of Week 1, 4% on Day 2 of Week 1, and 8% with subsequent infusions.\nThe median time to onset of a reaction was 1.8 hours (range: 0.1 to 5.4 hours). The incidence of \ninfusion interruptions due to reactions was 30%. Median durations of infusions were 4.2 h for Week 1-\nDay 1, 4.2 h for Week 1-Day 2, and 3.4 hours for the subsequent infusions.\n\nInfections\nIn patients receiving DARZALEX combination therapy, Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported as \nfollows:\nRelapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 21%, Vd: 19%; DRd: 27%, Rd: 23%; DPd: 28%\nNewly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 23%, VMP: 15%; DRd: 32%, Rd: 23%; D-VTd: 22%,\nVTd: 20%.\nPneumonia was the most commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection across studies. In active \ncontrolled studies, discontinuations from treatment due to infections occurred in 1-4% of patients.\nFatal infections were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis.\nIn patients receiving DARZALEX combination therapy, fatal infections (Grade 5) were reported as \nfollows:\nRelapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 1%, Vd: 2%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 1%; DPd: 2%\nNewly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 1%, VMP: 1%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 2%; DVTd: 0%, VTd: 0%.\nKey: D=daratumumab; Vd=bortezomib-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Pd=pomalidomide-\ndexamethasone; VMP=bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone; VTd=bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone.\n\nHaemolysis\nThere is a theoretical risk of haemolysis. Continuous monitoring for this safety signal will be\nperformed in clinical studies and post-marketing safety data.\n\nOther special populations\nIn the Phase III study MMY3007, which compared treatment with D-VMP to treatment with VMP in \npatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell \ntransplant, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an ECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: \nn=89, VMP: n=84), was consistent with the overall population (see section 5.1).\n\nElderly patients\n\n\n\n12\n\nOf the 2459 patients who received DARZALEX at the recommended dose, 38% were 65 to 75 years \nof age, and 15% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed \nbased on age. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in older than in younger patients.\nAmong patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (n=1213), the most common serious \nadverse reactions that occurred more frequently in elderly (≥65 years of age) were pneumonia and \nsepsis. Among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous \nstem cell transplant (n=710), the most common serious adverse reaction that occurred more frequently \nin elderly (≥75 years of age) was pneumonia.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms and signs\nThere has been no experience of overdose in clinical studies. Doses up to 24 mg/kg have been \nadministered intravenously in a clinical study.\n\nTreatment\nThere is no known specific antidote for daratumumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the \npatient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC24\n\nMechanism of action\nDaratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein \nexpressed at a high level on the surface of multiple myeloma tumour cells, as well as other cell types \nand tissues at various levels. CD38 protein has multiple functions such as receptor mediated adhesion, \nsignalling and enzymatic activity.\n\nDaratumumab has been shown to potently inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells. \nBased on in vitro studies, daratumumab may utilise multiple effector functions, resulting in immune \nmediated tumour cell death. These studies suggest that daratumumab can induce tumour cell lysis \nthrough complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and \nantibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in malignancies expressing CD38. A subset of myeloid \nderived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) \nare decreased by daratumumab mediated cell lysis. T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) are also known\nto express CD38 depending on the stage of development and the level of activation. Significant \nincreases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts, and percentages of lymphocytes, were observed \nwith daratumumab treatment in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow. In addition, T-cell receptor \nDNA sequencing verified that T-cell clonality was increased with daratumumab treatment, indicating \nimmune modulatory effects that may contribute to clinical response.\n\nDaratumumab induced apoptosis in vitro after Fc mediated cross-linking. In addition, daratumumab\nmodulated CD38 enzymatic activity, inhibiting the cyclase enzyme activity and stimulating the \nhydrolase activity. The significance of these in vitro effects in a clinical setting, and the implications \non tumour growth, are not well-understood.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nNatural killer (NK) cell and T-cell count\nNK cells are known to express high levels of CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell \nlysis. Decreases in absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells (CD16+CD56+) and activated \n(CD16+CD56dim) NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with \ndaratumumab treatment. However, baseline levels of NK cells did not show an association with \nclinical response.\n\nImmunogenicity\nIn patients treated with intravenous daratumumab in clinical trials, less than 1% of patients developed \ntreatment-emergent anti-daratumumab antibodies.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma\nCombination treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients ineligible for autologous \nstem cell transplant:\nStudy MMY3008, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled Phase III study, compared treatment \nwith DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) to \ntreatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with newly diagnosed \nmultiple myeloma. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week]\ncycles) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of \n20 mg/week for patients >75 years or body mass index [BMI] <18.5). On DARZALEX infusion days, \nthe dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for \nlenalidomide and dexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information. \nTreatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 737 patients were randomised: 368 to the DRd arm and 369 to the Rd arm. The baseline \ndemographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The median \nage was 73 (range: 45-90) years, with 44% of the patients ≥75 years of age. The majority were white \n(92%), male (52%), 34% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of \n0, 49.5% had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 17% had an ECOG performance score of ≥2. \nTwenty-seven percent had International Staging System (ISS) Stage I, 43% had ISS Stage II and 29% \nhad ISS Stage III disease. Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival (PFS) based on \nInternational Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.\n\nStudy MMY3008 showed an improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the DRd arm as \ncompared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not been reached in the DRd arm and was 31.9 months \nin the Rd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73; p<0.0001), representing 44% reduction in \nthe risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with DRd. Results of an updated PFS \nanalysis approximately 9 months after the original clinical cutoff, continued to show an improvement \nin PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS was not reached in the \nDRd arm and was 33.8 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.71; p<0.0001).\n\n\n\n14\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Study MMY3008\n\nAdditional efficacy results from Study MMY3008 are presented in Table 7 below.\n\n\n\n15\n\nTable 7: Additional efficacy results from Study MMY3008a\n\nDRd (n=368) Rd (n=369)\nOverall response (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) n(%)a 342 (92.9%) 300 (81.3%)\np-valueb <0.0001\n\nStringent complete response (sCR) 112 (30.4%) 46 (12.5%)\nComplete response (CR) 63 (17.1%) 46 (12.5%)\nVery good partial response (VGPR) 117 (31.8%) 104 (28.2%)\nPartial response (PR) 50 (13.6%) 104 (28.2%)\n\nCR or better (sCR + CR) 175 (47.6%) 92 (24.9%)\np-valueb <0.0001\nVGPR or better (sCR + CR + VGPR) 292 (79.3%) 196 (53.1%)\np-valueb <0.0001\nMRD negativity ratea,c n(%) 89 (24.2%) 27 (7.3%)\n95% CI (%) (19.9%, 28.9%) (4.9%, 10.5%)\nOdds ratio with 95% CId 4.04 (2.55, 6.39)\np-valuee <0.0001\nDRd=daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; MRD=minimal residual disease; \nCI=confidence interval\na Based on intent-to-treat population\nb p-value from Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Squared test.\nc Based on threshold of 10-5\n\nd Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the odds ratio for un-stratified tables is used.

The median duration of response \nhad not been reached in the DRd group and was 34.7 months (95% CI: 30.8, not estimable) in the Rd \ngroup.\n\nCombination treatment with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) in patients ineligible for \nautologous stem cell transplant:\nStudy MMY3007, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled Phase III study, compared treatment \nwith DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP), to \ntreatment with VMP in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Bortezomib was \nadministered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly at \nWeeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week cycle (Cycle 1; 8 doses), followed by once weekly \nadministrations at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight more 6-week cycles (Cycles 2-9; 4 doses per cycle). \nMelphalan at 9 mg/m2, and prednisone at 60 mg/m2 were orally administered on Days 1 to 4 of the \nnine 6-week cycles (Cycles 1-9). DARZALEX treatment was continued until disease progression or\nunacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 706 patients were randomised: 350 to the D-VMP arm and 356 to the VMP arm. The \nbaseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The \nmedian age was 71 (range: 40-93) years, with 30% of the patients ≥75 years of age. The majority were \nwhite (85%), female (54%), 25% had an ECOG performance score of 0, 50% had an ECOG \nperformance score of 1 and 25% had an ECOG performance score of 2. Patients had IgG/IgA/Light \nchain myeloma in 64%/22%/10% of instances, 19% had ISS Stage I, 42% had ISS Stage II, 38% had \nISS Stage III disease and 84% had standard risk cytogenetics. Efficacy was evaluated by PFS based on\nIMWG criteria and overall survival (OS).\n\nWith a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in Study MMY3007 showed an \nimprovement in the D-VMP arm as compared to the VMP arm; the median PFS had not been reached \nin the D-VMP arm and was 18.1 months in the VMP arm (HR=0.5; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.65; p<0.0001).\nResults of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 40 months continued to show an \nimprovement in PFS for patients in the D-VMP arm compared with the VMP arm. Median PFS was \n36.4 months in the D-VMP arm and 19.3 months in the VMP arm (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.51;\n\n\n\n16\n\np<0.0001), representing a 58% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated \nwith D-VMP.\n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Study MMY3007\n\nAfter a median follow-up of 40 months, D-VMP has shown an overall survival (OS) advantage over\nthe VMP arm (HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.80; p=0.0003), representing a 40% reduction in the risk of \ndeath in patients treated in the D-VMP arm.

The median duration \n\n\n\n18\n\nof response had not been reached in the D-VMP group and was 21.3 months (range: 18.4, not \nestimable) in the VMP group.\n\nA subgroup analysis was performed on patients at least 70 years old, or those 65-69 years old with \nECOG performance score of 2, or aged less than 65 years of age with significant comorbidity or \nECOG performance score of 2 (D-VMP: n=273, VMP: n=270). The efficacy results in this subgroup \nwere consistent with the overall population. In this subgroup, median PFS was not reached in the D-\nVMP group and was 17.9 months in the VMP group (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.75); p<0.0001). The \noverall response rate was 90% in the D-VMP group and 74% in theVMP group (VGPR rate:29% in \nD-VMP group and 26% in VMP group; CR: 22% in D-VMP group and 18% in VMP group; sCR rate: \n20% in D-VMP group and 7% in VMP group). The safety results of this subgroup were consistent \nwith the overall population. Furthermore, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an ECOG \nperformance score of 2 (D-VMP: n=89, VMP: n=84), was also consistent with the overall population.\n\nCombination treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) in patients eligible\nfor autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT):\nStudy MMY3006 is a 2 Part, open-label, randomised, active-controlled Phase III study. Part 1 \ncompared induction and consolidation treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with \nbortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VTd) to treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide and \ndexamethasone (VTd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for ASCT. The \nconsolidation phase of treatment began a minimum of 30 days post-ASCT, when the patient had\nrecovered sufficiently, and engraftment was complete. In Part 2, subjects with at least a partial \nresponse (PR) by Day 100 post-transplant were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to daratumumab \nmaintenance or observation only. Only results from Part 1 are described henceforth.\n\nBortezomib was administered by subcutaneous injection or intravenous injection at a dose of \n1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of repeated 28 day (4-\nweek) induction treatment cycles (Cycles 1-4) and two consolidation cycles (Cycles 5 and 6) \nfollowing ASCT after Cycle 4. Thalidomide was administered orally at 100 mg daily during the six\nbortezomib cycles. Dexamethasone (oral or intravenous) was administered at 40 mg on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, \n15, 16, 22 and 23 of Cycles 1 and 2, and at 40 mg on Days 1-2 and 20 mg on subsequent dosing days \n(Days 8, 9, 15, 16) of Cycles 3-4. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 \nin Cycles 5 and 6. On the days of DARZALEX infusion, the dexamethasone dose was administered \nintravenously as a pre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for bortezomib, thalidomide and \ndexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information.\n\nA total of 1085 patients were randomised: 543 to the D-VTd arm and 542 to the VTd arm. The \nbaseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The \nmedian age was 58 (range: 22 to 65) years. All patients were ≤65 years: 43% were in the age group\n≥60-65 years, 41% were in the age group ≥50-60 years and 16% below age of 50 years.

Prior therapies included bortezomib (99%), lenalidomide (99%), \npomalidomide (63%) and carfilzomib (50%). At baseline, 97% of patients were refractory to the last \nline of treatment, 95% were refractory to both, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulatory \nagent (IMiD), 77% were refractory to alkylating agents, 63% were refractory to pomalidomide and\n48% of patients were refractory to carfilzomib.\n\nEfficacy results of the pre-planned interim analysis based on Independent Review Committee (IRC)\nassessment are presented in Table 10 below.\n\nTable 10: IRC assessed efficacy results for study MMY2002\nEfficacy endpoint DARZALEX 16 mg/kg\n\nN=106\nOverall response rate1 (ORR: sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) [n (%)] 31 (29.2)\n95% CI (%) (20.8, 38.9)\n\nStringent complete response (sCR) [n (%)] 3 (2.8)\nComplete response (CR) [n] 0\nVery good partial response (VGPR) [n (%)] 10 (9.4)\nPartial response (PR) [n (%)] 18 (17.0)\n\nClinical Benefit Rate (ORR+MR) [n (%)] 36 (34.0)\n\n\n\n20\n\nMedian Duration of Response [months (95% CI)] 7.4 (5.5, NE)\nMedian Time to Response [months (range)] 1 (0.9; 5.6)\n1 Primary efficacy endpoint (International Myeloma Working Group criteria)\nCI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable; MR=minimal response\n\nOverall response rate (ORR) in MMY2002 was similar regardless of type of prior anti-myeloma\ntherapy.\nAt a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 14.7 months, median Overall Survival \n(OS) was 17.5 months (95% CI:13.7, not estimable).\n\nIn Study GEN501, 42 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received 16 mg/kg \nDARZALEX until disease progression. The median patient age was 64 years (range, 44 to 76 years), \n64% were male and 76% were Caucasian. Patients in the study had received a median of 4 prior lines \nof therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had received prior ASCT. Prior therapies included \nbortezomib (100%), lenalidomide (95%), pomalidomide (36%) and carfilzomib (19%). At baseline, \n76% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment, 64% were refractory to both a PI and \nIMiD, 60% were refractory to alkylating agents, 36% were refractory to pomalidomide and 17% were \nrefractory to carfilzomib.\n\nPre-planned interim analysis showed that treatment with daratumumab at 16 mg/kg led to a 36% ORR \nwith 5% CR and 5% VGPR. The median time to response was 1 (range: 0.5 to 3.2) month. The \nmedian duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 5.6 months, not estimable).\n\nAt a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 15.2 months, median OS was not reached\n(95% CI: 19.9 months, not estimable), with 74% of subjects still alive.\n\nCombination treatment with lenalidomide:\nStudy MMY3003, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled Phase III trial, compared treatment \nwith DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) to \ntreatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with relapsed or refractory \nmultiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally \non Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose dexamethasone at \n40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients >75 years or BMI <18.5). On DARZALEX \ninfusion days, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-infusion medicinal product and \nthe remainder given the day after the infusion. Treatment was continued in both arms until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 569 patients were randomised; 286 to the DRd arm and 283 to the Rd arm. The baseline \ndemographic and disease characteristics were similar between the DARZALEX and the control arm. \nThe median patient age was 65 years (range 34 to 89 years) and 11% were ≥75 years. The majority of \npatients (86%) received a prior PI, 55% of patients had received a prior IMiD, including 18% of \npatients who had received prior lenalidomide; and 44% of patients had received both a prior PI and \nIMiD. At baseline, 27% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment. Eighteen percent \n(18%) of patients were refractory to a PI only, and 21% were refractory to bortezomib. Patients\nrefractory to lenalidomide were excluded from the study.\n\nWith a median follow-up of 13.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3003 \ndemonstrated an improvement in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not \nbeen reached in the DRd arm and was 18.4 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; \np<0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 55 months continued to \nshow an improvement in PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS\nwas 45.0 months in the DRd arm and 17.5 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.54; \np<0.0001), representing a 56% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated \nwith DRd (see Figure 4).\n\n\n\n21\n\nFigure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Study MMY3003\n\nAdditional efficacy results from Study MMY3003 are presented in Table 11 below.\n\nTable 11: Additional efficacy results from Study MMY3003\nResponse evaluable patient number DRd (n=281) Rd (n=276) \nOverall response (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) \nn(%) 261 (92.9) 211 (76.4)\n\np-valuea <0.0001\nStringent complete response (sCR) 51 (18.1) 20 (7.2)\nComplete response (CR) 70 (24.9) 33 (12.0)\nVery good partial response (VGPR) 92 (32.7) 69 (25.0)\nPartial response (PR) 48 (17.1) 89 (32.2)\n\nMedian Time to Response [months (95% CI)] 1.0 (1.0, 1.1) 1.3 (1.1, 1.9)\nMedian Duration of Response [months (95% \nCI)]\n\nNE (NE, NE) 17.4 (17.4, NE)\n\nMRD negative rate (95% CI) b (%) 21.0 (16.4, 26.2) 2.8 (1.2, 5.5)\nOdds ratio with 95% CIc 9.31 (4.31, 20.09)\nP-valued <0.0001\n\nDRd=daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; MRD=minimal residual disease; \nCI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable.\na p-value from Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Squared test.\nb Based on Intent-to-treat population and threshold of 10-5\n\nc Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the common odds ratio is used.

Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous injection \nor intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks (Days 1, \n4, 8, and 11) of repeated 21 day (3-week) treatment cycles, for a total of 8 cycles. Dexamethasone was \nadministered orally at a dose of 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each of the 8 bortezomib \ncycles (80 mg/week for two out of three weeks of the bortezomib cycle) or a reduced dose of \n20 mg/week for patients >75 years, BMI <18.5, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or prior intolerance \nto steroid therapy. On the days of DARZALEX infusion, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was \nadministered as a pre-infusion medicinal product. DARZALEX treatment was continued until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 498 patients were randomised; 251 to the DVd arm and 247 to the Vd arm. The baseline \ndemographic and disease characteristics were similar between the DARZALEX and the control arm. \nThe median patient age was 64 years (range 30 to 88 years) and 12% were ≥75 years.\nSixty-nine percent (69%) of patients had received a prior PI (66% received bortezomib) and 76% of \npatients received an IMiD (42% received lenalidomide). At baseline, 32% of patients were refractory \nto the last line of treatment. Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients were refractory to an IMiD only, \nand 28% were refractory to lenalidomide. Patients refractory to bortezomib were excluded from the \nstudy.\n\nWith a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3004\ndemonstrated an improvement in the DVd arm as compared to the Vd arm; the median PFS had not \nbeen reached in the DVd arm and was 7.2 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.39 [0.28, 0.53]; p-\nvalue<0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 50 months continued \nto show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DVd arm compared with the Vd arm. Median PFS \nwas 16.7 months in the DVd arm and 7.1 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.24, 0.39]; p-\nvalue<0.0001), representing a 69% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients \ntreated with DVd versus Vd (see Figure 5).\n\n\n\n23\n\nFigure 5: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Study MMY3004\n\nAdditional efficacy results from Study MMY3004 are presented in Table 12 below.\n\nTable 12: Additional efficacy results from Study MMY3004\nResponse evaluable patient number DVd (n=240) Vd (n=234) \nOverall response (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) n(%) 199 (82.9) 148 (63.2)\n\nP-valuea <0.0001\nStringent complete response (sCR) 11 (4.6) 5 (2.1)\nComplete response (CR) 35 (14.6) 16 (6.8)\nVery good partial response (VGPR) 96 (40.0) 47 (20.1)\nPartial response (PR) 57 (23.8) 80 (34.2)\n\nMedian Time to Response [months (range)] 0.9 (0.8, 1.4) 1.6 (1.5, 2.1) \nMedian Duration of Response [months (95% CI)] NE (11.5, NE) 7.9 (6.7, 11.3)\nMRD negative rate (95% CI)b 8.8% (5.6%, 13.0%) 1.2% (0.3%, 3.5%)\n\nOdds ratio with 95% CIc 9.04 (2.53, 32.21)\nP-valued 0.0001\n\nDVd=daratumumab- bortezomib-dexamethasone; Vd=bortezomib-dexamethasone; MRD=minimal residual disease; \nCI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable.\na p-value from Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Squared test.\nb Based on Intent-to-treat population and threshold of 10-5\n\nc Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the common odds ratio is used.

The effect of \ndaratumumab on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label study for 83 patients (Study \nGEN501) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma following daratumumab infusions (4 to \n24 mg/kg). Linear mixed PK-PD analyses indicated no large increase in mean QTcF interval (i.e. \ngreater than 20 ms) at daratumumab Cmax.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDARZALEX in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of daratumumab following intravenous administration of daratumumab \nmonotherapy were evaluated in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma at dose levels \nfrom 0.1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg.\n\nIn the 1 to 24 mg/kg cohorts, peak serum concentrations (Cmax) after the first dose increased in \napproximate proportion to dose and volume of distribution was consistent with initial distribution into \nthe plasma compartment. Following the last weekly infusion, Cmax increased in a greater than \ndose-proportional manner, consistent with target mediated drug disposition. Increases in AUC were \nmore than dose-proportional and clearance (CL) decreased with increasing dose. These observations \nsuggest CD38 may become saturated at higher doses, after which the impact of target binding \nclearance is minimised and the clearance of daratumumab approximates the linear clearance of \nendogenous IgG1. Clearance also decreased with multiple doses, which may be related to tumour \nburden decreases.\n\nTerminal half-life increases with increasing dose and with repeated dosing. The mean (standard \ndeviation [SD]) estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the first 16 mg/kg dose was 9 \n(4.3) days. The estimated terminal half-life of daratumumab following the last 16 mg/kg dose \nincreased, but there are insufficient data for a reliable estimation. Based on population PK analysis, the \nmean (SD) half-life associated with non-specific linear elimination was approximately 18 (9) days; \nthis is the terminal half-life that can be expected upon complete saturation of target mediated clearance \nand repeat dosing of daratumumab.\n\nAt the end of weekly dosing for the recommended monotherapy schedule and dose of 16 mg/kg, the \nmean (SD) serum Cmax value was 915 (410.3) micrograms/mL, approximately 2.9-fold higher than \nfollowing the first infusion. The mean (SD) predose (trough) serum concentration at the end of weekly \ndosing was 573 (331.5) micrograms/mL.\n\nFour population PK analyses were performed to describe the PK characteristics of daratumumab and \nto evaluate the influence of covariates on the disposition of daratumumab in patients with multiple \nmyeloma; Analysis 1 (n=223) in patients receiving DARZALEX monotherapy while Analysis 2 \n(n=694), Analysis 3 (n=352) and Analysis 4 (n=355) were conducted in patients with multiple \nmyeloma that received daratumumab combination therapies. Analysis 2 included 694 patients (n=326 \nfor lenalidomide-dexamethasone; n=246 for bortezomib-dexamethasone; n=99 for pomalidomide-\ndexamethasone; n=11 for bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone; and n=12 for bortezomib-thalidomide-\ndexamethasone), Analysis 3 included 352 patients (bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone) and Analysis 4 \nincluded 355 patients (lenalidomide-dexamethasone).\n\nBased on the population PK analysis of daratumumab monotherapy (Analysis 1), daratumumab steady \nstate is achieved approximately 5 months into the every 4-week dosing period (by the 21st infusion),\nand the mean (SD) ratio of Cmax at steady-state to Cmax after the first dose was 1.6 (0.5). The mean (SD) \ncentral volume of distribution is 56.98 (18.07) mL/kg.\n\n\n\n25\n\nThree additional population PK analyses (Analysis 2, Analysis 3 and Analysis 4) were conducted in \npatients with multiple myeloma that received daratumumab combination therapies. Daratumumab \nconcentration-time profiles were similar following the monotherapy and combination therapies. The\nmean estimated terminal half-life associated with linear clearance in combination therapy was \napproximately 15-23 days.\n\nBased on the four population PK analyses (Analyses 1-4) body weight was identified as a statistically\nsignificant covariate for daratumumab clearance. Therefore, body weight based dosing is an \nappropriate dosing strategy for the multiple myeloma patients.\n\nSimulation of daratumumab pharmacokinetics was conducted for all recommended dosing schedules \nin 1,309 patients with multiple myeloma. The simulation results confirmed that the split and single \ndosing for the first dose provide similar PK, with the exception of the PK profile in the first day of the \ntreatment.\n\nSpecial populations\nAge and gender\nBased on four individual population PK analyses (1-4) in patients receiving daratumumab \nmonotherapy or various combination therapies (Analyses 1-4), age (range: 31-93 years) had no \nclinically important effect on the PK of daratumumab, and the exposure of daratumumab was similar \nbetween younger (aged <65 years, n=518) and older (aged ≥65 to <75 years n=761; aged ≥75 years, \nn=334) patients.\n\nGender did not affect exposure of daratumumab to a clinically relevant degree in the population PK \nanalyses.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Four \nindividual population PK analyses were performed based on pre-existing renal function data in \npatients receiving daratumumab monotherapy, or various combination therapies (Analyses 1-4), and \nincluded a total of 441 patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CRCL] ≥90 mL/min), \n621 with mild renal impairment (CRCL <90 and ≥60 mL/min), 523 with moderate renal impairment \n(CRCL <60 and ≥30 mL/min), and 27 with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease\n(CRCL<30 mL/min). No clinically important differences in exposure to daratumumab were observed \nbetween patients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Changes \nin hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of daratumumab since IgG1 \nmolecules such as daratumumab are not metabolised through hepatic pathways.\nFour individual population PK analyses were performed in patients receiving daratumumab \nmonotherapy or various combination therapies (Analyses 1-4), and included a total of 1404 patients \nwith normal hepatic function (total bilirubin [TB] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit \nof normal [ULN]), 189 with mild hepatic impairment (TB 1.0 x to 1.5 x ULN or AST >ULN) and \n8 patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 x to 3.0 x ULN; n=7), or severe (TB > 3.0 x ULN; n=1) hepatic \nimpairment. No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab were observed \nbetween patients with hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function.\n\nRace\nBased on four individual population PK analyses in patients receiving either daratumumab \nmonotherapy or various combination therapies (Analyses 1-4), the exposure to daratumumab was \nsimilar between white (n=1371) and non-white subjects (n=242).\n\n\n\n26\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nToxicology data have been derived from studies with daratumumab in chimpanzees and with a \nsurrogate anti-CD38 antibody in cynomolgus monkeys. No chronic toxicity testing has been \nconducted.\n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity\nNo animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of daratumumab.\n\nReproductive toxicology\nNo animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of daratumumab on \nreproduction or development.\n\nFertility\nNo animal studies have been performed to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females.\n\n6.

Dose delay may be required to allow recovery \nof blood cell counts in the event of haematological toxicity (see section 4.4). For information\nconcerning medicinal products given in combination with DARZALEX, see corresponding Summary \nof Product Characteristics.\n\nIn clinical studies, no modification to rate or dose of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection\nwas required to manage IRRs.\n\nRecommended concomitant medicinal products\n\nPre-injection medicinal product\nPre-injection medicinal products (oral or intravenous) should be administered to reduce the risk of \nIRRs to all patients 1-3 hours prior to every administration of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous\ninjection as follows:\n\n Corticosteroid (long-acting or intermediate-acting) \n- Monotherapy:\n\nMethylprednisolone 100 mg, or equivalent. Following the second injection, the dose of \ncorticosteroid may be reduced to methylprednisolone 60 mg.\n\n- Combination therapy:\nDexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent), administered prior to every DARZALEX solution \nfor subcutaneous injection. When dexamethasone is the background-regimen specific \ncorticosteroid, the dexamethasone treatment dose will instead serve as pre-injection \n\n\n\n32\n\nmedicinal product on DARZALEX administration days (see section 5.1). Additional \nbackground regimen specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) should not be taken on \nDARZALEX administration days when patients have received dexamethasone (or \nequivalent) as a pre-injection medicinal product.\n\n Antipyretics (paracetamol 650 to 1,000 mg).\n Antihistamine (oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent).\n\nPost-injection medicinal product\nPost-injection medicinal products should be administered to reduce the risk of delayed IRRs as \nfollows:\n\n- Monotherapy:\nOral corticosteroid (20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose of an intermediate-acting\nor long-acting corticosteroid in accordance with local standards) should be administered on \neach of the two days following all injections (beginning the day after the injection).\n\n- Combination therapy:\nConsider administering low-dose oral methylprednisolone (≤20 mg) or equivalent the day \nafter the DARZALEX injection. However, if a background regimen specific corticosteroid \n(e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone) is administered the day after the DARZALEX injection, \nadditional post-injection medicinal products may not be needed (see section 5.1).\n\nIf the patient experiences no major IRRs after the first three injections, post-injection corticosteroids \n(excluding any background regimen corticosteroids) may be discontinued.\n\nAdditionally, for patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the use of \npost-injection medicinal products including short and long acting bronchodilators, and inhaled\ncorticosteroids should be considered. Following the first four injections, if the patient experiences no \nmajor IRRs, these inhaled post-injection medicinal products may be discontinued at the discretion of \nthe physician.\n\nProphylaxis for herpes zoster virus reactivation\nAnti-viral prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of herpes zoster virus reactivation.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nNo formal studies of daratumumab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo formal studies of daratumumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted.\nNo dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of DARZALEX in children aged below 18 years of age have not been\nestablished.\nNo data are available (see section 5.1).\n\nBody weight (>120 kg)\nLimited number of patients with body weight >120 kg have been studied using flat-dose (1,800 mg) \nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection and efficacy in these patients has not been \n\n\n\n33\n\nestablished. No dose adjustment based on body weight can currently be recommended (see\nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nDARZALEX subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be \ngiven by subcutaneous injection only, using the doses specified. See section 6.6 for special precautions \nprior to administration.\n\nTo avoid needle clogging, attach the hypodermic injection needle or subcutaneous infusion set to the \nsyringe immediately prior to injection.\n\nInject 15 mL DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection into the subcutaneous tissue of \nthe abdomen approximately 7.5 cm to the right or left of the navel over approximately \n3-5 minutes. Do not inject DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection at other sites of the body \nas no data are available. \n\nInjection sites should be rotated for successive injections.\n\nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should never be injected into areas where the skin is\nred, bruised, tender, hard or areas where there are scars.\n\nPause or slow down delivery rate if the patient experiences pain. In the event pain is not alleviated by \nslowing down the injection, a second injection site may be chosen on the opposite side of the abdomen \nto deliver the remainder of the dose.\n\nDuring treatment with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection, do not administer other \nmedicinal products for subcutaneous use at the same site as DARZALEX.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection can cause severe and/or serious IRRs, including \nanaphylactic reactions. In clinical studies, approximately 11% (52/490) of patients experienced an \nIRR. Most IRRs occurred following the first injection and were Grade 1-2. IRRs occurring with \nsubsequent injections were seen in less than 1% of patients (see section 4.8).\n\nThe median time to onset of IRRs following DARZALEX injection was 3.7 hours (range \n0.15-83 hours). The majority of IRRs occurred on the day of treatment. Delayed IRRs have occurred\nin less than 1% of patients.\n\nSigns and symptoms of IRRs may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, \nthroat irritation, allergic rhinitis, wheezing as well as pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, \nnausea, and hypotension. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, \ndyspnoea, hypertension and tachycardia (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients should be pre-medicated with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids as well as \nmonitored and counselled regarding IRRs, especially during and following the first and second \ninjections. If an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reactions occur, appropriate \n\n\n\n34\n\nemergency care should be initiated immediately. DARZALEX therapy should be discontinued \nimmediately and permanently (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n\nTo reduce the risk of delayed IRRs, oral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients \nfollowing DARZALEX injection (see section 4.2). Patients with a history of chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease may require additional post-injection medicinal products to manage respiratory \ncomplications. The use of post-injection medicinal products (e.g. short- and long-acting \nbronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids) should be considered for patients with chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (see section 4.2).\n\nNeutropenia/Thrombocytopenia\nDARZALEX may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy (see \nsection 4.8).\nComplete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically during treatment according to \nmanufacturer’s prescribing information for background therapies. Patients with neutropenia should be\nmonitored for signs of infection. DARZALEX delay may be required to allow recovery of blood cell \ncounts. In lower body weight patients receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation, higher rates \nof neutropenia were observed; however, this was not associated with higher rates of serious infections. \nNo dose reduction of DARZALEX is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions or \ngrowth factors.\n\nInterference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)\nDaratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a \npositive indirect Coombs test. Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test may persist for \nup to 6 months after the last daratumumab administration. It should be recognised that daratumumab \nbound to RBCs may mask detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The \ndetermination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted.\n\nPatients should be typed and screened prior to starting daratumumab treatment. Phenotyping may be\nconsidered prior to starting daratumumab treatment as per local practice. Red blood cell genotyping is \nnot impacted by daratumumab and may be performed at any time.\n\nIn the event of a planned transfusion blood transfusion centres should be notified of this interference \nwith indirect antiglobulin tests (see section 4.5). If an emergency transfusion is required, \nnon-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given per local blood bank practices.\n\nInterference with determination of complete response\nDaratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum \nprotein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of \nendogenous M-protein (see section 4.5). This interference can impact the determination of complete \nresponse and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation\nHepatitis B virus reactivation, in some cases fatal, has been reported in patients treated with \nDARZALEX. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with\nDARZALEX.\nFor patients with evidence of positive HBV serology, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV \nreactivation during, and for at least six months following the end of DARZALEX treatment. Manage \npatients according to current clinical guidelines. Consider consulting a hepatitis disease expert as \nclinically indicated.\nIn patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on DARZALEX, suspend treatment with \nDARZALEX and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of DARZALEX treatment in patients \nwhose HBV reactivation is adequately controlled should be discussed with physicians with expertise \nin managing HBV.\n\n\n\n35\n\nBody weight (>120 kg)\nThere is a potential for reduced efficacy with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection in \npatients with body weight >120 kg (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nExcipients\nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance \n(HFI) should not take this medicinal product (see section 2).\n\nThis medicinal product also contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say\nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nAs an IgG1қ monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact \ndaratumumab are unlikely to represent major elimination routes. As such, variations in \ndrug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. Due to the \nhigh affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is not anticipated to alter drug-metabolising \nenzymes.\n\nClinical pharmacokinetic assessments with daratumumab and lenalidomide, pomalidomide, \nthalidomide, bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone, carfilzomib and dexamethasone indicated no \nclinically-relevant drug-drug interaction between daratumumab and these small molecule medicinal \nproducts.\n\nInterference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)\nDaratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including antibody \nscreening and cross matching (see section 4.4). Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include\ntreating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally \nvalidated methods. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, \nKell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated \nRBCs. Alternatively, phenotyping or genotyping may also be considered (see section 4.4).\n\nInterference with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests\nDaratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) \nassays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). This can lead to false \npositive SPE and IFE assay results for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial \nassessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In \npatients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected, \nconsider using a validated daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any \nremaining endogenous M protein in the patient’s serum, to facilitate determination of a complete \nresponse.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception\nWomen of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during, and for 3 months after \ncessation of daratumumab treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no human or animal data to assess the risk of daratumumab use during pregnancy. IgG1 \nmonoclonal antibodies are known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore \ndaratumumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit of treatment to the woman is\nconsidered to outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking\nthis medicine, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus.\n\n\n\n36\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether daratumumab is excreted into human or animal milk.\nMaternal IgG is excreted in human milk, but does not enter the neonatal and newborn/infant \ncirculations in substantial amounts as they are degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed.\n\nThe effect of daratumumab on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision should be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue DARZALEX therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nNo data are available to determine potential effects of daratumumab on fertility in males or females \n(see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDARZALEX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue \nhas been reported in patients taking daratumumab and this should be taken into account when driving \nor using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (≥20 % patients) with daratumumab (either\nintravenous or subcutaneous formulations) when administered either as monotherapy or combination \ntreatment were IRRs, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, pyrexia, cough, neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia, anaemia, oedema peripheral, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory \ntract infection. Serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, \nsepsis, pulmonary oedema, influenza, pyrexia, dehydration, diarrhoea and atrial fibrillation.\n\nWith the exception of IRRs (see Table 5 below), the safety profile of DARZALEX subcutaneous \nformulation (evaluated in 260 and 258 patients treated with the subcutaneous and intravenous \nformulations respectively) from the Phase III study MMY3012 was similar to the known safety profile \nof the intravenous formulation. Neutropenia is the only adverse reaction reported at ≥ 5% higher \nfrequency for DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation compared to intravenous daratumumab \n(Grade 3 or 4: 13% vs 8%, respectively).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 5 summarises the adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving DARZALEX \nsubcutaneous formulation or intravenous formulation of daratumumab.\n\nThe data reflects exposure to DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (1,800 mg) in 490 patients with \nmultiple myeloma (MM) including 260 patients from a Phase III active-controlled trial\n(Study MMY3012) who received DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection as monotherapy \nand three open-label, clinical studies in which patients received DARZALEX solution for \nsubcutaneous injection either as monotherapy (N=31, MMY1004 and MMY1008) and MMY2040 in \nwhich patients received DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection in combination with either \nbortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP, n=67), lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd, \nn=65) or bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-VRd, n=67). \n\nThe safety data also reflects exposure to intravenous daratumumab (16 mg/kg) in 2324 patients with \nmultiple myeloma including 1910 patients who received intravenous daratumumab in combination \nwith background regimens and 414 patients who received intravenous daratumumab as monotherapy. \nPost-marketing adverse reactions are also included.\n\nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, \nwhere relevant, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n37\n\nTable 5: Adverse reactions in multiple myeloma patients treated with intravenous\ndaratumumab or subcutaneous daratumumab\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency Incidence (%)\nAny Grade Grade 3-4\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nUpper respiratory tract \ninfectiona\n\nVery Common 38% 2%\n\nBronchitisa Very Common 14% 2%\nPneumoniaa Very Common 14% 9%\nUrinary tract infection Common 7% 1%\nInfluenza Common 4% 1%#\n\nSepsisa Common 4% 3%\nCytomegalovirus infectiona Common 1% <1%#\n\nHepatitis B Virus \nreactivationa\n\nUncommon <1% <1%\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nNeutropeniaa Very Common 40% 33%\nThrombocytopeniaa Very Common 30% 18%\nAnaemiaa Very Common 27% 12%\nLymphopeniaa Very Common 13% 11%\nLeukopeniaa Very Common 11% 6%\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nAnaphylactic reactionb Rare - -\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\nDecreased appetite Very Common 10% 1%\nHyperglycaemia Common 6% 3%\nHypocalcaemia Common 5% 1%\nDehydration Common 2% 1%#\n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Very Common 14% 1%#\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy\n\nVery Common 26% 3%\n\nHeadache Very Common 11% <1%#\n\nDizziness Common 9% <1%#\n\nParaesthesia Common 9% <1%\nCardiac disorders Atrial fibrillation Common 3% 1%\nVascular disorders Hypertensiona Very Common 10% 5%\nRespiratory, thoracic\nand mediastinal\ndisorders\n\nCougha Very Common 22% <1%#\n\nDyspnoeaa Very Common 18% 2%\nPulmonary oedemaa Common 1% <1%\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nDiarrhoea Very Common 29% 3%\nConstipation Very Common 28% 1%\nNausea Very Common 23% 1%#\n\nVomiting Very Common 14% 1%#\n\nPancreatitisa Common 1% <1%\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash Common 9% <1%#\n\nPruritus Common 5% <1%#\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nBack pain Very Common 17% 2%\nMuscle spasms Very Common 12% <1%#\n\nArthralgia Very Common 10% 1%#\n\nMusculoskeletal chest pain Common 6% <1%#\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nFatigue Very Common 23% 3%\nOedema peripherala Very Common 22% 1%\nPyrexia Very Common 22% 1%\nAsthenia Very Common 18% 2%\nChills Common 9% <1%#\n\nInjection site erythemae Common 4% 0\nInjection site reactionsd,e Common 8% 0\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications\n\nInfusion-related reactionsc\n\nDaratumumab\nintravenousf\n\nVery Common 39% 5%\n\nDaratumumab \nsubcutaneouse\n\nVery Common 11% 1%#\n\n\n\n38\n\n# No grade 4\na Indicates a grouping of terms.\nb Based on post-marketing adverse reactions.\nc Infusion-related reactions includes terms determined by investigators as related to infusion/injection of \n\ndaratumumab.\nd Injection site reactions includes terms determined by investigators as related to injection of daratumumab.\ne Frequency based on daratumumab subcutaneous studies only (N=490).\nf Frequency based on daratumumab intravenous studies only (N=2324).\nNote: Based on 2814 multiple myeloma patients treated with daratumumab intravenous or daratumumab \nsubcutaneous.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs)\nIn clinical studies (monotherapy and combination treatments; N=490) with DARZALEX subcutaneous\nformulation, the incidence of any grade IRRs was 10.2% with the first injection of DARZALEX\n(1,800 mg, Week 1), 0.2% with the Week 2 injection, and 0.8% with subsequent injections. Grade 3 \nIRRs were seen in 1.4% of patients. No patients had Grade 4 IRRs.\n\nSigns and symptoms of IRR may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, \nthroat irritation, allergic rhinitis, wheezing as well as pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting,\nnausea, and hypotension. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, \ndyspnoea, hypertension and tachycardia (see section 4.4).\n\nInjection site reactions (ISRs)\nIn clinical studies (N=490) with DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation, the incidence of any grade \ninjection site reaction was 8.2%. There were no Grade 3 or 4 ISRs. The most common (≥1%) ISRs \nwere erythema, injection site induration, pruritis.\n\nInfections \nIn patients receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation as monotherapy, incidence of infections \nwas similar between DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (52.9%) versus intravenous\ndaratumumab groups (50.0%). Additionally, Grade 3 or 4 infections also occurred at similar \nfrequencies between DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (11.7%) and intravenous daratumumab \n(14.3%). Most infections were manageable and rarely led to treatment discontinuation. Pneumonia\nwas the most commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection across studies.\n\nIn patients receiving intravenous daratumumab combination therapy, Grade 3 or 4 infections were \nreported as follows:\nRelapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 21%, Vd: 19%; DRd: 27%, Rd: 23%; DPd: 28%\nNewly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 23%, VMP: 15%; DRd: 32%, Rd: 23%; D-VTd: 22%, \nVTd: 20%.\nPneumonia was the most commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection across studies. In active \ncontrolled studies, discontinuations from treatment due to infections occurred in 1-4% of patients. \nFatal infections were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis.\nIn patients receiving intravenous daratumumab combination therapy, fatal infections (Grade 5) were \nreported as follows:\nRelapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 1%, Vd: 2%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 1%; DPd: 2%\nNewly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 1%, VMP: 1%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 2%; DVTd: 0%, VTd: 0%.\nKey: D=daratumumab; Vd=bortezomib-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Pd=pomalidomide-\ndexamethasone; VMP=bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone; VTd=bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone.\n\nHaemolysis\nThere is a theoretical risk of haemolysis. Continuous monitoring for this safety signal will be \nperformed in clinical studies and post-marketing safety data.\n\n\n\n39\n\nOther special populations\nIn the Phase III study MMY3007, which compared treatment with D-VMP to treatment with VMP in \npatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell \ntransplant, safety analysis of the subgroup of patients with an ECOG performance score of 2 \n(D-VMP: n=89, VMP: n=84), was consistent with the overall population (see section 5.1).\n\nElderly patients\nOf the 3207 patients who received daratumumab (n=490 subcutaneous; n=2717 intravenous) at the \nrecommended dose, 38% were 65 to 75 years of age, and 17% were 75 years of age or older. No \noverall differences in effectiveness were observed based on age. The incidence of serious adverse\nreactions was higher in older than in younger patients. Among patients with relapsed and refractory \nmultiple myeloma (n=1827), the most common serious adverse reactions that occurred more \nfrequently in elderly (≥65 years of age) were pneumonia and sepsis. Among patients with newly \ndiagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (n=777), the most \ncommon serious adverse reaction that occurred more frequently in elderly (≥75 years of age) was\npneumonia.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms and signs\nThere has been no experience of overdose in clinical studies.\n\nTreatment\nThere is no known specific antidote for daratumumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the \npatient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC24\n\nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection contains recombinant human hyaluronidase \n(rHuPH20). rHuPH20 works locally and transiently to degrade hyaluronan ((HA), a naturally \noccurring glycoaminoglycan found throughout the body) in the extracellular matrix of the \nsubcutaneous space by cleaving the linkage between the two sugars (N-acetylglucosamine and \nglucuronic acid) which comprise HA. rHuPH20 has a half-life in skin of less than 30 minutes. \nHyaluronan levels in subcutaneous tissue return to normal within 24 to 48 hours because of the rapid \nbiosynthesis of hyaluronan.\n\nMechanism of action\nDaratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein \nexpressed at a high level on the surface of multiple myeloma tumour cells, as well as other cell types \nand tissues at various levels. CD38 protein has multiple functions such as receptor mediated adhesion, \nsignalling and enzymatic activity.\n\nDaratumumab has been shown to potently inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing tumour cells. \nBased on in vitro studies, daratumumab may utilise multiple effector functions, resulting in immune \nmediated tumour cell death. These studies suggest that daratumumab can induce tumour cell lysis \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n40\n\nthrough complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and \nantibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in malignancies expressing CD38. A subset of myeloid \nderived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) \nare decreased by daratumumab mediated cell lysis. T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) are also known \nto express CD38 depending on the stage of development and the level of activation. Significant \nincreases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts, and percentages of lymphocytes, were observed \nwith daratumumab treatment in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow. In addition, T-cell receptor \nDNA sequencing verified that T-cell clonality was increased with daratumumab treatment, indicating \nimmune modulatory effects that may contribute to clinical response.\n\nDaratumumab induced apoptosis in vitro after Fc mediated cross-linking. In addition, daratumumab \nmodulated CD38 enzymatic activity, inhibiting the cyclase enzyme activity and stimulating the \nhydrolase activity. The significance of these in vitro effects in a clinical setting, and the implications \non tumour growth, are not well-understood.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nNatural killer (NK) cell and T-cell count\nNK cells are known to express high levels of CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell \nlysis. Decreases in absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells (CD16+CD56+) and activated \n(CD16+CD56dim) NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with \ndaratumumab treatment. However, baseline levels of NK cells did not show an association with \nclinical response.\n\nImmunogenicity\nIn patients treated with subcutaneous daratumumab in clinical trials, less than 1% of patients \ndeveloped treatment-emergent anti-daratumumab antibodies.\n\nThe incidence of treatment-emergent non-neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies was 7.8% (35/447); \nwith 7.5% (19/255) in the monotherapy DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation groups, and 8.3% \n(16/192) in the pooled combination DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation groups. The \nanti-rHuPH20 antibodies did not appear to impact daratumumab exposures. The clinical relevance of \nthe development of anti-daratumumab or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies after treatment with DARZALEX \nsubcutaneous formulation is not known.\n\nClinical experience of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection (subcutaneous formulation)\nMonotherapy – relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma\nMMY3012, an open-label, randomised, Phase III non-inferiority study, compared efficacy and safety \nof treatment with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection (1,800 mg) vs. intravenous \n(16 mg/kg) daratumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received \nat least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent or \nwho were double-refractory to a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD). \nTreatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\nA total of 522 patients were randomised: 263 to the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation arm and \n259 to the intravenous daratumumab arm. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were \nsimilar between the two treatment groups. The median patient age was 67 years (range: 33-92 years), \n55% were male and 78% were Caucasian. The median patient weight was 73 kg (range: 29 – 138 kg) \nPatients had received a median of 4 prior lines of therapy. A total of 51% of patients had prior \nautologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), 100% of patients were previously treated with both PI(s) and \nIMiD(s) and most patients were refractory to a prior systemic therapy, including both PI and IMiD \n(49%).\n\nThe study met its co-primary endpoints of overall response rate (ORR) by the IMWG response criteria \n(Table 6) and maximum Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 3 Day 1, (see section 5.2).\n\n\n\n41\n\nTable 6: Key results from Study MMY3012\nSubcutaneous\nDaratumumab\n\n(N=263)\n\nIntravenous\nDaratumumab\n\n(N=259)\nPrimary Endpoint\n\nOverall response (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR), n (%)a 108 (41.1%) 96 (37.1%)\n95% CI (%) (35.1%, 47.3%) (31.2%, 43.3%)\n\nRatio of response rates (95% CI)b 1.11 (0.89, 1.37)\nCR or better, n (%) 5 (1.9%) 7 (2.7%)\nVery good partial response (VGPR) 45 (17.1%) 37 (14.3%)\nPartial response (PR) 58 (22.1%) 52 (20.1%)\n\nSecondary Endpoint\nRate of Infusion-related Reaction, n (%)c 33 (12.7%) 89 (34.5%)\nProgression-free Survival, months\n\nMedian (95% CI) 5.59 (4.67, 7.56) 6.08 (4.67, 8.31)\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.99 (0.78, 1.26)\n\na Based on intent-to-treat population.\nb p-value <0.0001 from Farrington-Manning test for non-inferiority hypothesis.\nc Based on safety population.

However, open-label studies are subject to bias.\n\nCombination therapies in multiple myeloma\nMMY2040 was an open-label trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX subcutaneous\nformulation 1,800 mg:\n\n- in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) in patients with \nnewly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) who are ineligible for transplant. Bortezomib\nwas administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice \nweekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week cycle (Cycle 1; 8 doses), followed by \nonce weekly administrations at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight more 6-week cycles \n(Cycles 2-9; 4 doses per cycle). Melphalan at 9 mg/m2, and prednisone at 60 mg/m2 were \norally administered on Days 1 to 4 of the nine 6-week cycles (Cycles 1-9). DARZALEX \nsubcutaneous formulation was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n\n- in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) in patients with relapsed or\nrefractory MM. Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day\n[4-week] cycles) was given with low dose dexamethasone 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose \nof 20 mg/week for patients >75 years or BMI<18.5). DARZALEX subcutaneous\nformulation was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n- in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (D-VRd) in patients\nwith newly diagnosed MM who are transplant eligible. Bortezomib was administered by \nsubcutaneous injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly at Weeks 1 \nand 2. Lenalidomide was administered orally at 25 mg once daily on Days 1-14; low dose \ndexamethasone was administered 40 mg/week in 3-week cycles. Total treatment duration \nwas 4 cycles.\n\nA total of 199 patients (D-VMP: 67; D-Rd: 65; D-VRd: 67) were enrolled. Efficacy results were \ndetermined by computer algorithm using IMWG criteria.

Lenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on Days 1-21 of\nrepeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone \n40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients >75 years or body mass index [BMI] \n<18.5). On intravenous daratumumab infusion days, the dexamethasone dose was given as a \npre-infusion medicinal product. Dose adjustments for lenalidomide and dexamethasone were applied \naccording to manufacturer’s prescribing information. Treatment was continued in both arms until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 737 patients were randomised: 368 to the DRd arm and 369 to the Rd arm. The baseline \ndemographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The median \nage was 73 (range: 45-90) years, with 44% of the patients ≥75 years of age. The majority were white \n(92%), male (52%), 34% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of \n0, 49.5% had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 17% had an ECOG performance score of ≥2. \nTwenty-seven percent had International Staging System (ISS) Stage I, 43% had ISS Stage II and 29% \nhad ISS Stage III disease. Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival (PFS) based on \nInternational Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.\n\nStudy MMY3008 showed an improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the DRd arm as \ncompared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not been reached in the DRd arm and was 31.9 months \nin the Rd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73; p<0.0001), representing 44% reduction in\nthe risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with DRd. Results of an updated PFS \nanalysis approximately 9 months after the original clinical cutoff, continued to show an improvement \nin PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm.

The median patient age was 63.5 years (range, 31 \nto 84 years), 11% of patients were ≥75 years of age, 49% were male and 79% were Caucasian. \nPatients had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy. Eighty percent of patients had received prior \nautologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Prior therapies included bortezomib (99%), lenalidomide \n(99%), pomalidomide (63%) and carfilzomib (50%). At baseline, 97% of patients were refractory to \nthe last line of treatment, 95% were refractory to both, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and \nimmunomodulatory agent (IMiD), 77% were refractory to alkylating agents, 63% were refractory to \npomalidomide and 48% of patients were refractory to carfilzomib.\n\nEfficacy results of the pre-planned interim analysis based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) \nassessment are presented in Table 11 below.\n\nTable 11: IRC assessed efficacy results for study MMY2002\nEfficacy endpoint Intravenous daratumumab\n\n16 mg/kg\nN=106\n\nOverall response rate1 (ORR: sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) [n (%)] 31 (29.2)\n95% CI (%) (20.8, 38.9)\n\nStringent complete response (sCR) [n (%)] 3 (2.8)\nComplete response (CR) [n] 0\nVery good partial response (VGPR) [n (%)] 10 (9.4)\nPartial response (PR) [n (%)] 18 (17.0)\n\n\n\n49\n\nClinical Benefit Rate (ORR+MR) [n (%)] 36 (34.0)\nMedian Duration of Response [months (95% CI)] 7.4 (5.5, NE)\nMedian Time to Response [months (range)] 1 (0.9; 5.6)\n1 Primary efficacy endpoint (International Myeloma Working Group criteria)\nCI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable; MR=minimal response\n\nOverall response rate (ORR) in MMY2002 was similar regardless of type of prior anti-myeloma \ntherapy.\nAt a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 14.7 months, median Overall Survival \n(OS) was 17.5 months (95% CI:13.7, not estimable).\n\nIn Study GEN501, 42 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received 16 mg/kg \nintravenous daratumumab until disease progression. The median patient age was 64 years (range, 44 to\n76 years), 64% were male and 76% were Caucasian. Patients in the study had received a median of 4 \nprior lines of therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had received prior ASCT. Prior therapies \nincluded bortezomib (100%), lenalidomide (95%), pomalidomide (36%) and carfilzomib (19%). At \nbaseline, 76% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment, 64% were refractory to both a PI \nand IMiD, 60% were refractory to alkylating agents, 36% were refractory to pomalidomide and 17% \nwere refractory to carfilzomib.\n\nPre-planned interim analysis showed that treatment with daratumumab at 16 mg/kg led to a 36% ORR \nwith 5% CR and 5% VGPR. The median time to response was 1 (range: 0.5 to 3.2) month. The \nmedian duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 5.6 months, not estimable).\n\nAt a survival update with a median duration of follow-up of 15.2 months, median OS was not reached \n(95% CI: 19.9 months, not estimable), with 74% of subjects still alive.\n\nCombination treatment with lenalidomide:\nStudy MMY3003, an open-label, randomised, active-controlled Phase III trial, compared treatment \nwith intravenous daratumumab 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose \ndexamethasone (DRd) to treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients\nwith relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. \nLenalidomide (25 mg once daily orally on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given \nwith low dose dexamethasone at 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients >75 years \nor BMI <18.5). On intravenous daratumumab infusion days, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was \ngiven as a pre-infusion medicinal product and the remainder given the day after the infusion. \nTreatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 569 patients were randomised; 286 to the DRd arm and 283 to the Rd arm. The baseline \ndemographic and disease characteristics were similar between the intravenous daratumumab and the \ncontrol arm. The median patient age was 65 years (range 34 to 89 years) and 11% were ≥75 years. The \nmajority of patients (86%) received a prior PI, 55% of patients had received a prior IMiD, including \n18% of patients who had received prior lenalidomide; and 44% of patients had received both a prior PI \nand IMiD. At baseline, 27% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment. Eighteen percent \n(18%) of patients were refractory to a PI only, and 21% were refractory to bortezomib. Patients \nrefractory to lenalidomide were excluded from the study.\n\nWith a median follow-up of 13.5 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3003 \ndemonstrated an improvement in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not \nbeen reached in the DRd arm and was 18.4 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; \np<0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 55 months continued to \nshow an improvement in PFS for patients in the DRd arm compared with the Rd arm. Median PFS\nwas 45.0 months in the DRd arm and 17.5 months in the Rd arm (HR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.54; \np<0.0001), representing a 56% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated \nwith DRd (see Figure 4).\n\n\n\n50\n\nFigure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Study MMY3003\n\nAdditional efficacy results from Study MMY3003 are presented in Table 12 below.\n\nTable 12: Additional efficacy results from Study MMY3003\nResponse evaluable patient number DRd (n=281) Rd (n=276) \nOverall response (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) \nn(%) 261 (92.9) 211 (76.4)\n\np-valuea <0.0001\nStringent complete response (sCR) 51 (18.1) 20 (7.2)\nComplete response (CR) 70 (24.9) 33 (12.0)\nVery good partial response (VGPR) 92 (32.7) 69 (25.0)\nPartial response (PR) 48 (17.1) 89 (32.2)\n\nMedian Time to Response [months (95% CI)] 1.0 (1.0, 1.1) 1.3 (1.1, 1.9)\nMedian Duration of Response [months (95% \nCI)]\n\nNE (NE, NE) 17.4 (17.4, NE)\n\nMRD negative rate (95% CI) b (%) 21.0 (16.4, 26.2) 2.8 (1.2, 5.5)\nOdds ratio with 95% CIc 9.31 (4.31, 20.09)\nP-valued <0.0001\n\nDRd=daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone; Rd=lenalidomide-dexamethasone; MRD=minimal residual disease; \nCI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable.\na p-value from Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Squared test.\nb Based on Intent-to-treat population and threshold of 10-5\n\nc Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the common odds ratio is used.

Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous\ninjection or intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks \n(Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of repeated 21 day (3-week) treatment cycles, for a total of 8 cycles. \nDexamethasone was administered orally at a dose of 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each\nof the 8 bortezomib cycles (80 mg/week for two out of three weeks of the bortezomib cycle) or a \nreduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients >75 years, BMI <18.5, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or \nprior intolerance to steroid therapy. On the days of intravenous daratumumab infusion, 20 mg of the \ndexamethasone dose was administered as a pre-infusion medicinal product. intravenous daratumumab\ntreatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nA total of 498 patients were randomised; 251 to the DVd arm and 247 to the Vd arm. The baseline \ndemographic and disease characteristics were similar between the intravenous daratumumab and the \ncontrol arm. The median patient age was 64 years (range 30 to 88 years) and 12% were ≥75 years. \nSixty-nine percent (69%) of patients had received a prior PI (66% received bortezomib) and 76% of \npatients received an IMiD (42% received lenalidomide). At baseline, 32% of patients were refractory \nto the last line of treatment. Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients were refractory to an IMiD only, \nand 28% were refractory to lenalidomide. Patients refractory to bortezomib were excluded from the \nstudy.\n\nWith a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the primary analysis of PFS in study MMY3004 \ndemonstrated an improvement in the DVd arm as compared to the Vd arm; the median PFS had not \nbeen reached in the DVd arm and was 7.2 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.39 [0.28, 0.53]; \np-value<0.0001). Results of an updated PFS analysis after a median follow-up of 50 months continued \nto show an improvement in PFS for patients in the DVd arm compared with the Vd arm. Median PFS \nwas 16.7 months in the DVd arm and 7.1 months in the Vd arm (HR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.24, 0.39]; \np-value<0.0001), representing a 69% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients \ntreated with DVd versus Vd (see Figure 5).\n\n\n\n52\n\nFigure 5: Kaplan-Meier Curve of PFS in Study MMY3004\n\nAdditional efficacy results from Study MMY3004 are presented in Table 13 below.\n\nTable 13: Additional efficacy results from Study MMY3004\nResponse evaluable patient number DVd (n=240) Vd (n=234) \nOverall response (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) n(%) 199 (82.9) 148 (63.2)\n\nP-valuea <0.0001\nStringent complete response (sCR) 11 (4.6) 5 (2.1)\nComplete response (CR) 35 (14.6) 16 (6.8)\nVery good partial response (VGPR) 96 (40.0) 47 (20.1)\nPartial response (PR) 57 (23.8) 80 (34.2)\n\nMedian Time to Response [months (range)] 0.9 (0.8, 1.4) 1.6 (1.5, 2.1) \nMedian Duration of Response [months (95% CI)] NE (11.5, NE) 7.9 (6.7, 11.3)\nMRD negative rate (95% CI)b 8.8% (5.6%, 13.0%) 1.2% (0.3%, 3.5%)\n\nOdds ratio with 95% CIc 9.04 (2.53, 32.21)\nP-valued 0.0001\n\nDVd=daratumumab- bortezomib-dexamethasone; Vd=bortezomib-dexamethasone; MRD=minimal residual disease; \nCI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable.\na p-value from Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Squared test.\nb Based on Intent-to-treat population and threshold of 10-5\n\nc Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the common odds ratio is used.

The effect of \ndaratumumab on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label study for 83 patients (Study \nGEN501) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma following daratumumab infusions (4 to \n24 mg/kg). Linear mixed PK-PD analyses indicated no large increase in mean QTcF interval (i.e. \ngreater than 20 ms) at daratumumab Cmax.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDARZALEX in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nDaratumumab exposure in a monotherapy study following the recommended 1,800 mg administration \nof DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation (weekly for 8 weeks, biweekly for 16 weeks, monthly \nthereafter) as compared to 16 mg/kg intravenous daratumumab for the same dosing schedule, showed \nnon-inferiority for the co-primary endpoint of maximum Ctrough (Cycle 3 Day 1 pre-dose), with mean ± \nSD of 593 ± 306 µg/mL compared to 522 ± 226 µg/mL for intravenous daratumumab, with a \ngeometric mean ratio of 107.93% (90% CI: 95.74-121.67).\n\nFollowing the recommended dose of 1,800 mg DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection, peak \nconcentrations (Cmax) increased 4.8-fold and total exposure (AUC0-7 days) increased 5.4-fold from first \ndose to last weekly dose (8th dose). Highest trough concentrations for DARZALEX solution for \nsubcutaneous injection are typically observed at the end of the weekly dosing regimens for both \nmonotherapy and combination therapy.\n\nThe simulated trough concentrations following 6 weekly doses of 1,800 mg DARZALEX solution for \nsubcutaneous injection for combination therapy were similar to 1,800 mg DARZALEX solution for \nsubcutaneous injection monotherapy.\n\nAbsorption and distribution\nAt the recommended dose of 1,800 mg, the absolute bioavailability of DARZALEX solution for \nsubcutaneous injection is 69%, with an absorption rate of 0.012 hour-1, with peak concentrations \noccurring at 70 to 72 h (Tmax).\n\nThe model predicted mean estimate of the volume of distribution for the central compartment was\n5.25 L (36.9% CV) and peripheral compartment was 3.78 L, suggesting that daratumumab is primarily\nlocalised to the vascular system with limited extravascular tissue distribution.\n\nMetabolism and elimination\nDaratumumab exhibits both concentration and time-dependent pharmacokinetics with parallel linear\nand nonlinear (saturable) elimination that is characteristic of target-mediated clearance. The \npopulation PK model estimated mean clearance value of daratumumab is 4.96 mL/h (58.7% CV). The \nmodel-based geometric mean for half-life associated with linear elimination is 20.4 days (22.4% CV). \nFor the monotherapy regimen, the steady state is achieved at approximately 5 months into every \n4 weeks dosage at the recommended dose and schedule (1,800 mg; once weekly for 8 weeks, every \n2 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks thereafter).\n\nA population PK analysis was conducted using data from DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous \ninjection monotherapy and combination therapy, and the predicted PK exposures are summarised in \nTable 14.\n\n\n\n54\n\nTable 14: Daratumumab exposure following administration of DARZALEX subcutaneous\nformulation (1,800 mg) or intravenous daratumumab (16 mg/kg) monotherapy\n\nPK parameters Cycles subcutaneous\ndaratumumab\n\nMedian (5th; 95th\n\npercentile)\n\nintravenous\ndaratumumab\n\nMedian (5th; 95th\n\npercentile)\n\nCtrough (µg/mL) \nCycle 1, 1st weekly dose 123 (36; 220) 112 (43; 168)\nCycle 2, last weekly dose \n(Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough)\n\n563 (177; 1063) 472 (144; 809)\n\nCmax (µg/mL) \nCycle 1, 1st weekly dose 132 (54; 228) 256 (173; 327)\nCycle 2, last weekly dose 592 (234; 1114) 688 (369; 1061)\n\nAUC0-7 days (µg/mL•day) \nCycle 1, 1st weekly dose 720 (293; 1274) 1187 (773; 1619)\nCycle 2, last weekly dose 4017 (1515; 7564) 4019 (1740; 6370)\n\nSpecial populations\n\nAge and gender\nBased on population PK analyses in patients (33-92 years) receiving monotherapy or various \ncombination therapies, age had no statistically significant effect on the PK of daratumumab. No \nindividualisation is necessary for patients on the basis of age.\n\nGender had a statistically significant effect on PK, with slightly higher exposure in females than \nmales, but the difference in exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. No individualisation is \nnecessary for patients on the basis of gender. \n\nRenal impairment\nNo formal studies of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation in patients with renal impairment have \nbeen conducted. Population PK analyses were performed based on pre-existing renal function data in \npatients receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation monotherapy or various combination \ntherapies, including 220 patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CRCL] \n≥90 mL/min), 273 with mild renal impairment (CRCL <90 and ≥60 mL/min), 215 with moderate renal \nimpairment (CRCL <60 and ≥30 mL/min), and 33 with severe renal impairment or end stage renal \ndisease (CRCL<30 mL/min). No clinically important differences in exposure to daratumumab were \nobserved between patients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo formal studies of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation in patients with hepatic impairment have \nbeen conducted.\nPopulation PK analyses were performed in patients receiving DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation \nmonotherapy or various combination therapies, including 655 patients with normal hepatic function \n(total bilirubin [TB] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN]), 82 with \nmild hepatic impairment [(total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN) or (ULN < total bilirubin \n≤1.5×ULN)] and 5 patients with moderate (1.5×ULN < total bilirubin ≤3×ULN) hepatic impairment. \nNo clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab were observed between patients \nwith normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment. There were very few patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment and no patients with severe hepatic impairment to make meaningful \nconclusions for these populations.\n\nRace\nBased on the population PK analyses in patients receiving either DARZALEX subcutaneous\nformulation monotherapy or various combination therapies, the daratumumab exposure was similar \nacross races.\n\nBody weight\nThe flat-dose administration of DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation 1,800 mg as monotherapy \nachieved adequate exposure for all body-weight subgroups. The mean Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough in the \nlower body-weight subgroup (≤65 kg) was 60% higher and in the higher body weight (>85 kg) \n\n\n\n55\n\nsubgroup, 12% lower than the intravenous daratumumab subgroup. In some patients with body weight \n>120 kg, lower exposure was observed which may result in reduced efficacy. However, this \nobservation is based on limited number of patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nToxicology data have been derived from studies with daratumumab in chimpanzees and with a \nsurrogate anti-CD38 antibody in cynomolgus monkeys. No chronic toxicity testing has been \nconducted.\n\nNo animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of daratumumab.\n\nNo animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of daratumumab on \nreproduction or development or to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females.\n\nNo carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted for recombinant human \nhyaluronidase. There were no effects on reproductive tissues and function and no systemic exposure of \nhyaluronidase in monkeys given 22,000 U/kg/week subcutaneously (12 times higher than the human \ndose) for 39 weeks. As hyaluronidase is a recombinant form of the endogenous human hyaluronidase, \nno carcinogenity, mutagenesis, or effects on fertility are expected.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4\nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What DARZALEX is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you are given DARZALEX\n3. How DARZALEX is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store DARZALEX\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What DARZALEX is and what it is used for\n\nWhat DARZALEX is\nDARZALEX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance daratumumab. It belongs to a\ngroup of medicines called “monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that have \nbeen designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body. Daratumumab has been designed \nto attach to specific cancer cells in your body, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer \ncells.\n\nWhat DARZALEX is used for\nDARZALEX is used in adults 18 years or older, who have a type of cancer called “multiple \nmyeloma”. This is a cancer of your bone marrow.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given DARZALEX\n\nYou must not be given DARZALEX\n- if you are allergic to daratumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\nDo not use DARZALEX if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse \nbefore you are given DARZALEX.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX:\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nDARZALEX is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein. Before and after each infusion of DARZALEX, \nyou will be given medicines which help to lower the chance of infusion-related reactions (see\n“Medicines given during treatment with DARZALEX” in section 3). These reactions can happen \nduring the infusion or in the 3 days after the infusion.\nIn some cases you may have a severe allergic reaction which may include a swollen face, lips, mouth,\ntongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing or an itchy rash (hives).\n\n\n\n76\n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion-related reactions listed at the top\nof section 4.\n\nIf you get infusion-related reactions, you may need other medicines, or the infusion may need to be \nslowed down or stopped. When these reactions go away, or get better, the infusion can be started\nagain.\nThese reactions are most likely to happen with the first infusion. If you have had an infusion-related \nreaction once it is less likely to happen again. Your doctor may decide not to use DARZALEX if you \nhave a strong infusion reaction.\n\nDecreased blood cell counts\nDARZALEX can decrease white blood cell counts which help fight infections, and blood cells called\nplatelets which help to clot blood. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any symptoms of \ninfection such as fever or any symptoms of decreased platelet counts such as bruising or bleeding.\n\nBlood transfusions\nIf you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. \nDARZALEX can affect the results of this blood test. Tell the person doing the test that you are using\nDARZALEX.\n\nHepatitis B\nTell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because \nDARZALEX could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for \nsigns of this infection before, during and for some time after treatment with DARZALEX. Tell your \ndoctor right away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give DARZALEX to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because it is not \nknown how the medicine will affect them.\n\nOther medicines and DARZALEX\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines.\n\nPregnancy\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX if you are pregnant, think you might \nbe pregnant or are planning to have a baby.\nIf you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. \nYou and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your \nbaby.\n\nContraception\nWomen who are being given DARZALEX should use effective contraception during treatment and for \n3 months after treatment.\n\nBreast-feeding\nYou and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. \nThis is because the medicine may pass into the mother’s milk and it is not known how it will affect the \nbaby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may feel tired after taking DARZALEX which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nDARZALEX contains sodium\nThis medicine contains 9.3 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5 mL vial. This \nis equivalent to 0.46% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.\n\n\n\n77\n\nThis medicine contains 37.3 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 20 mL vial. \nThis is equivalent to 1.86% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.\n\n3. How DARZALEX is given\n\nHow much is given\nYour doctor will work out your dose and schedule of DARZALEX. The dose of DARZALEX will \ndepend on your body weight.\n\nThe usual starting dose of DARZALEX is 16 mg per kg of body weight. DARZALEX may be given\nalone or together with other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma.\nWhen given alone, DARZALEX is given as follows:\n once a week for the first 8 weeks\n then once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks\n then once every 4 weeks after that as long as your condition does not worsen.\n\nWhen DARZALEX is given together with other medicines your doctor may change the time between \ndoses as well as how many treatments you will receive.\n\nIn the first week your doctor may give you the DARZALEX dose split over two consecutive days.\n\nHow the medicine is given\nDARZALEX will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. It is given as a drip into a vein (“intravenous\ninfusion”) over several hours.\n\nMedicines given during treatment with DARZALEX\nYou may be given medicines to lower the chance of getting shingles.\n\nBefore each infusion of DARZALEX you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance of \ninfusion-related reactions. These may include:\n medicines for an allergic reaction (anti-histamines)\n medicines for inflammation (corticosteroids)\n medicines for fever (such as paracetamol).\n\nAfter each infusion of DARZALEX you will be given medicines (such as corticosteroids) to lower the \nchance of infusion-related reactions.\n\nPeople with breathing problems\nIf you have breathing problems, such as asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), \nyou will be given medicines to inhale which help your breathing problems:\n medicines to help the airways in your lungs stay open (bronchodilators)\n medicines to lower swelling and irritation in your lungs (corticosteroids)\n\nIf you are given more DARZALEX than you should\nThis medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much \n(an overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects.\n\nIf you forget your appointment to have DARZALEX\nIt is very important to go to all your appointments to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an \nappointment, make another one as soon as possible.\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.\n\n\n\n78\n\n4.

Do not use if opaque particles, \ndiscolouration or other foreign particles are present.\n\n Using aseptic technique, remove a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride from the infusion\nbag/container that is equal to the required volume of DARZALEX solution.\n\n Withdraw the necessary amount of DARZALEX solution and dilute to the appropriate volume \nby adding to an infusion bag/container containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride. Infusion \nbags/containers must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n82\n\n(PE) or polyolefin blend (PP+PE). Dilute under appropriate aseptic conditions. Discard any \nunused portion left in the vial.\n\n Gently invert the bag/container to mix the solution. Do not shake.\n Visually inspect parenteral medicinal products for particulate matter and discolouration prior to \n\nadministration. The diluted solution may develop very small, translucent to white proteinaceous \nparticles, as daratumumab is a protein. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or \nforeign particles are observed.\n\n Since DARZALEX does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be administered \nwithin 15 hours (including infusion time) at room temperature (15°C-25°C) and in room light.\n\n If not used immediately, the diluted solution can be stored prior to administration for up to \n24 hours at refrigerated conditions (2°C-8°C) and protected from light. Do not freeze.\n\n Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow \nregulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone \n(PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometre). Polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, \nPP or PE administration sets must be used.\n\n Do not infuse DARZALEX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.\n Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused product or waste \n\nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch\nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\n\n\n83\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nDARZALEX 1,800 mg solution for injection\ndaratumumab\n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What DARZALEX is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you are given DARZALEX\n3. How DARZALEX is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store DARZALEX\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What DARZALEX is and what it is used for\n\nWhat DARZALEX is\nDARZALEX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance daratumumab. It belongs to a \ngroup of medicines called “monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that have\nbeen designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body. Daratumumab has been designed \nto attach to specific cancer cells in your body, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer \ncells.\n\nWhat DARZALEX is used for\nDARZALEX is used in adults 18 years or older, who have a type of cancer called “multiple \nmyeloma”. This is a cancer of your bone marrow.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given DARZALEX\n\nYou must not be given DARZALEX\n- if you are allergic to daratumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\nDo not use DARZALEX if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse \nbefore you are given DARZALEX.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX:\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nDARZALEX is given as a subcutaneous injection using a small needle to inject the medicine under \nyour skin. Before and after each injection, you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance \nof infusion-related reactions (see “Medicines given during treatment with DARZALEX” in section 3).\nThese reactions are most likely to happen with the first injection and most reactions occur on the day \nof injection. If you have had an infusion-related reaction once it is less likely to happen again. \n\n\n\n84\n\nHowever, delayed reactions can happen up to 3-4 days after the injection. Your doctor may decide not \nto use DARZALEX if you have a strong reaction after the injection.\n\nIn some cases you may have a severe allergic reaction which may include a swollen face, lips, mouth, \ntongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing or an itchy rash (hives). See section 4.\n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion-related reactions listed at the top \nof section 4. If you get infusion-related reactions, you may need other medicines to treat your \nsymptoms, or the injections may need to be stopped. When these reactions go away, or get better, the \ninjection can be started again.\n\nDecreased blood cell counts\nDARZALEX can decrease white blood cell counts which help fight infections, and blood cells called \nplatelets which help to clot blood. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any symptoms of \ninfection such as fever or any symptoms of decreased platelet counts such as bruising or bleeding.\n\nBlood transfusions\nIf you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. \nDARZALEX can affect the results of this blood test. Tell the person doing the test that you are using \nDARZALEX.\n\nHepatitis B\nTell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because \nDARZALEX could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for \nsigns of this infection before, during and for some time after treatment with DARZALEX. Tell your \ndoctor right away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give DARZALEX to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because it is not \nknown how the medicine will affect them.\n\nOther medicines and DARZALEX\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines.\n\nPregnancy\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX if you are pregnant, think you might \nbe pregnant or are planning to have a baby.\nIf you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.\nYou and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your \nbaby.\n\nContraception\nWomen who are being given DARZALEX should use effective contraception during treatment and for \n3 months after treatment.\n\nBreast-feeding\nYou and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. \nThis is because the medicine may pass into the mother’s milk and it is not known how it will affect the \nbaby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may feel tired after taking DARZALEX which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 15 mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n\n\n85\n\nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection contains sorbitol\nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you have an intolerance to some sugars \nor if you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in \nwhich a person cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you take this medicine.\n\n3. How DARZALEX is given\n\nHow much is given\nThe dose of DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection is 1,800 mg.\n\nDARZALEX may be given alone or together with other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. \nWhen given alone, DARZALEX is given as follows:\n once a week for the first 8 weeks\n then once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks\n then once every 4 weeks after that as long as your condition does not worsen.\n\nWhen DARZALEX is given together with other medicines your doctor may change the time between \ndoses as well as how many treatments you will receive.\n\nHow the medicine is given\nDARZALEX will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous \ninjection) over approximately 3 to 5 minutes. It is given in the stomach area (abdomen), not in other \nsites of the body, and not into areas of the abdomen where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or \nwhere there are scars.\n\nIf you experience pain during the injection, the doctor or nurse may interrupt the injection and give \nyou the remaining injection in another area of your abdomen.\n\nMedicines given during treatment with DARZALEX\nYou may be given medicines to lower the chance of getting shingles.\n\nBefore each injection of DARZALEX you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance of \ninfusion-related reactions. These may include:\n medicines for an allergic reaction (anti-histamines)\n medicines for inflammation (corticosteroids)\n medicines for fever (such as paracetamol).\n\nAfter each injection of DARZALEX you will be given medicines (such as corticosteroids) to lower the\nchance of infusion-related reactions.\n\nPeople with breathing problems\nIf you have breathing problems, such as asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), \nyou will be given medicines to inhale which help your breathing problems:\n medicines to help the airways in your lungs stay open (bronchodilators)\n medicines to lower swelling and irritation in your lungs (corticosteroids)\n\nIf you are given more DARZALEX than you should\nThis medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much \n(an overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects.\n\nIf you forget your appointment to have DARZALEX\nIt is very important to go to all your appointments to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an \nappointment, make another one as soon as possible.\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.\n\n\n\n86\n\n4.

DARZALEX solution for injection should be given by subcutaneous injection only, using \nthe dose specified. DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous \nadministration.\n\nDARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection is for single use only and is ready to use.\n\n DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection is compatible with polypropylene or \npolyethylene syringe material; polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) \nsubcutaneous infusion sets; and stainless steel transfer and injection needles.\n\n DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should be a clear to opalescent and colourless to \nyellow solution.  Do not use if opaque particles, discolouration or other foreign particles are \npresent.\n\n Remove the DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection vial from refrigerated storage (2°C \n– 8°C) and equilibrate to ambient temperature (15°C–30°C). The unpunctured vial may be stored \nat ambient temperature and ambient light for a maximum of 24 hours in the original carton to \nprotect from light. Keep out of direct sunlight. Do not shake.\n\n Prepare the dosing syringe in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n To avoid needle clogging, attach the hypodermic injection needle or subcutaneous infusion set to \nthe syringe immediately prior to injection.\n\nStorage of prepared syringe\n If the syringe containing DARZALEX is not used immediately, store the solution of DARZALEX \n\nfor up to 4 hours at ambient temperature and ambient light.\n\nAdministration\n Inject 15 mL DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection into the subcutaneous tissue of the \n\nabdomen approximately 7.5 cm to the right or left of the navel over approximately 3-5 minutes. \nDo not inject DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection at other sites of the body as no data \nare available. \n\n Injection sites should be rotated for successive injections.\n DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection should never be injected into areas where the \n\nskin is red, bruised, tender, hard or areas where there are scars.\n Pause or slow down delivery rate if the patient experiences pain. In the event pain is not alleviated \n\nby slowing down the injection, a second injection site may be chosen on the opposite side of the \nabdomen to deliver the remainder of the dose.\n\n During treatment with DARZALEX solution for subcutaneous injection, do not administer other \nmedicinal products for subcutaneous use at the same site as DARZALEX.\n\n Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
