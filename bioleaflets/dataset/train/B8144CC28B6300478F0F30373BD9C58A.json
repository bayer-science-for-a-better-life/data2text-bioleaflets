CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\n \nBreast cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of \npatients with: \n- operable node-positive breast cancer \n- operable node-negative breast cancer. \n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients \neligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of \nearly breast cancer (see section 5.1). \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. \n \nDocetaxel monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast \ncancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or \nan alkylating agent. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast \ncancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for \nmetastatic disease. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included \nan anthracycline. \n \n\n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\nDocetaxel is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung \ncancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n \n\n \nDocetaxel in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally \nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received \nchemotherapy for this condition.  \n \n\n \nProstate cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nhormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.  \n \n\n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n\nDocetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nmetastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have \nnot received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  \n \n\n \nHead and neck cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of \npatients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy \nand it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of anticancer \nchemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \nRecommended dose \n\nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). Prophylactic G-CSF may be \nused to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \nFor prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended premedication \nregimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section \n4.4). \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  \n \n\nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 \nevery 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n\nBreast cancer \n\nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in combination \ntherapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, with \ntrastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started the day \nfollowing the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered immediately \nafter completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was well tolerated. For \ntrastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n \n\nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \n\nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen is \ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment after \nfailure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m2 as a single agent. \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily is \nadministered continuously (see section 5.1). \n\nProstate cancer \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2, as a \n1-to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per day given as a 24-hour \ncontinuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \n\nGastric adenocarcinoma \n\nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the risk of \nhaematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \n\nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after cisplatin \nadministration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. All \npatients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received prophylactic \nantibiotics. \n\nHead and neck cancer \n\n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and \nneck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by \ncisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at \n750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.  Following \nchemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy.   \n\n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability \nof surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck \n(SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1, \nfollowed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour infusion, followed by \n5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. This regimen is \nadministered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive \nchemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \n\n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n\nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \u22651,500 cells/mm3. In patients who \nexperienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for more than one week, severe or \ncumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel therapy, the dose of \ndocetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If the patient \ncontinues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m2, the treatment should be discontinued. \n\nGeneral \n\n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n \n\nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.Patients who experience febrile neutropenia \nand/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m2 in all subsequent cycles \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should have their dose decreased \nto 60 mg/m2. \n \n\nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose nadir of \nplatelet count during the previous course of therapy is <25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who experience \nfebrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel dose in subsequent \ncycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of \nproduct characteristics. \n\nIn combination with cisplatin \n\n \n\n\u2022 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\n\u2022 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the next \ndocetaxel / capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0- 1, and resume at 100% of the \noriginal dose. \n\u2022 For patients developing the second appearance of  Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of Grade 3 \ntoxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and then resume \ntreatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m2. \n\u2022 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel dose. \n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \n\nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite G-CSF \nuse, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of complicated \nneutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should not be \nretreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level > 1,500 cells/mm3 and \nplatelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these toxicities persist (see section \n4.4). \n\nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \n\nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3 First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. \nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment. \nStomatitis/mucositis grade 3 First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. \n\nStomatitis/mucositis grade 4 First episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies, patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide prophylactic \ncoverage (e.g. day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \n\n \nSpecial populations: \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/ m2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range \n(ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of docetaxel is \n75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin >ULN and/or ALT and AST \n>3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be \nrecommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, \nthe pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN associated with alkaline \nphosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be \nrecommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients \nwith hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications. \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less than 18 \nyears have not yet been established. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of docetaxel in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, non-small \ncell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including type II and III \nless differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. In \ncombination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n\nElderly \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of <1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration, \nunless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of \nhypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, \n3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \n\n \nHaematology \n\nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of \n7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of complete \nblood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be retreated with \ndocetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \u22651,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of docetaxel \ntherapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate symptomatic \nmeasures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n \n\nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic G-CSF. \nPatients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of complicated \nneutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TCF \nshould be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received primary G-CSF \nprophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive adjuvant therapy \nwith TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged \nneutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and second \ninfusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the infusion \nof docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should be available. If \nhypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised cutaneous reactions do not \nrequire interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe hypotension, bronchospasm or \ngeneralised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients \nwho have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. \n \n\nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema followed \nby desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which \nlead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see section 4.2). \n\nCutaneous reactions \n\n \n\n \nFluid retention \n\nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \n\n \nPatients with liver impairment \n\nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels (ALT \nand/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels greater than \n2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as toxic deaths \nincluding sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, infections, \nthrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel in those patients \nwith elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at baseline and before \neach cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels >ULN and/or ALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN concurrent with \nserum alkaline phosphatase levels >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel \nshould not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, \nthe pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN associated with alkaline \nphosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be \nrecommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients \nwith hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications. \n \n\nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. \nPatients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \nNervous system \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n8 \n \n\n \n\nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may be \nmoderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n\nCardiac toxicity \n\n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they should \nundergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e.g. \nevery three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For more details see \nsummary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \n\nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least 6- \nmonths after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n\nOthers \n\n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n\nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n\nComplicated neutropenia \n\nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, may \nbe early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated promptly. \n\nGastrointestinal reactions \n\nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the follow \nup period. \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\nIn the docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treated patients, the risk of delayed \nmyelodysplasia or myeloid leukaemia requires haematological follow-up. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nThe benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ nodes was not defined fully at the interim analysis (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nPatients with 4+ nodes \n\nThere are limited data available in patients >70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n\nElderly \n\n \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients were 65 \nyears of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with docetaxel every \nthree weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 65 \nyears of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, \nand peripheral oedema occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus \nless than 65 years. \n \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) patients \ntreated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 74 were \n65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of serious adverse \nevents was higher in the elderly patients compared to younger patients. The incidence of the following \nadverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in \npatients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. \nElderly patients treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. \nEthanol \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n9 \n \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the enzyme \ncompetitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin and \ntroleandomycin. As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal \nproducts as concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (>95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions with \ntightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, phenytoin, \nsalicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. In addition, \ndexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not influence the binding of \ndigitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-\nadministration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction between \ndocetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was about 50% higher \nthan values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic prostate \ncancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. No statistically \nsignificant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals like ketoconazole or itraconazole). A drug \ninteraction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of \ndocetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves \nCYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower \ndoses. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be both \nembryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other cytotoxic \nmedicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. \nTherefore,docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  \n \n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential /contraception: \n\nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after \ntreatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \n\n \nLactation: \n\nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n10 \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel have \nbeen obtained in: \n\u2022 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel as a single agent \n\nrespectively. \n\u2022 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. \n\u2022 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. \n\u2022  92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. \n\u2022 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\u2022 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically \n\nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\u2022 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received docetaxel in \n\ncombination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important treatment related adverse \nevents are presented). \n\n\u2022 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in \nthe phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically \nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; grade 3-4 = G3/4; \ngrade 4 = G4) and the COSTART terms and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: very common \n(\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nvery rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was reversible \nand not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe neutropenia \n(<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea and asthenia. The \nseverity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in combination with other \nchemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There was \nan increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the trastuzumab \ncombination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects ( \u2265 5%) reported \nin a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see capecitabine \nsummary of product characteristics). \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the infusion \nof docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms were flushing, rash \nwith or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized rash/erythema (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n \nNervous system disorders \n\nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nMild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain including \nburning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n11 \n \n\n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to moderate. \nReactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and hands (including \nsevere hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently associated with \npruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. Less frequently, severe \nsymptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to interruption or discontinuation \nof docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe nail disorders are characterised by \nhypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. \n \n\n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, redness or \ndryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. Fluid retention includes events such \nas peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The \nperipheral oedema usually starts at the lower extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of \n3 kg or more.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 \n \n\n \nPreclinical data \n\nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The binding of \ndocetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments.  \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital \nmitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against \nfreshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not \nall cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, \ndocetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against \nadvanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \n\n \nClinical data \n\n \nBreast cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer\nData from a multicenter open label randomized study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment \nof patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \u2265 80%, between 18 and 70 years of age. After \nstratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to \nreceive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and \ncyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 \ncycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given as \nintravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as secondary prophylaxis to patients who \nexperienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on \nthe TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days \nstarting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients \nwith positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. \nAdjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and \nwas given to 69% of patients who received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. \n\n (TAX 316) \n\nAn interim analysis was performed with a median follow up of 55 months. Significantly longer disease-free \nsurvival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of relapses at 5 years was \nreduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC (25% versus 32%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute risk reduction by 7% (p=0.001). Overall survival at 5 years was also significantly increased \nwith TAC compared to FAC (87% versus 81%, respectively) i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n24 \n \n\nby 6% (p=0.008).

The effect appears to be less pronounced than in patients with 1-3 \npositive nodes. The benefit/risk ratio was not defined fully in patients with 4 and more positive nodes at this \nanalysis stage. \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy\n \n\n (GEICAM 9805) \n\nData from a multicenter open label randomized trial support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment \nof patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. 1060 patients were \nrandomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and \ncyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil \n500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable \nnode-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour \nsize > 2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 \nyears). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a \n1-hour infusion, all other drugs were given intravenously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomized. The incidence of Grade 4 \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who received primary \nG-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ \nand/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy \nwas administered according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of \npatients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. \n \nMedian duration of follow-up was 77 months. Significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). Overall \nsurvival (OS) was also longer in the TAC arm with TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk \nof death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29).

Three docetaxel \npatients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 doxorubicin patients (9%) \ndiscontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart failure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate (33% \nvs. 12%, p<0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and prolonged \noverall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8).  \n \nAn open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel monotherapy \nand paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous therapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel monotherapy \n100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour infusion. Both regimens were \nadministered every 3 weeks. \n Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel prolonged \nmedian time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p<0.01) and median survival (15.3 months vs \n12.7 months; p=0.03).  \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to paclitaxel \n(23.0%). \n \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomized phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, \nhas been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) (AT arm) \nversus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) (AC arm). Both \nregimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\u2022 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.0138. The median \nTTP was 37.3 weeks (95%CI : 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95%CI : 27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\u2022 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.009. The ORR \nwas 59.3% (95%CI : 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95%CI : 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. \n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia (8.5% \nversus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a higher \nincidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher incidence of severe \ncardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF decrease \u2265 20% (13.1 % \nversus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \u2265 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic deaths occurred in 1 patient in the \nAT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm (1 due to septic shock and 3 due to \ncongestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast \ncancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy for \nmetastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomized to receive docetaxel (100 mg/m2) with \nor without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. \nDocetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant \nanthracyclines.

In this study, 255 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and \ncapecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). 256 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). \nSurvival was superior in the docetaxel +capecitabine combination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was \n442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days (docetaxel alone). \nThe overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 41.6% \n(docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to progressive disease was \nsuperior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p<0.0001). The median time to progression was \n186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \n\n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) and \noverall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive Care. The \n1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). There was less use \nof morphinic analgesic (p<0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p<0.01), other disease-related medications \n(p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p<0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to those with \nBSC.  \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 26.1 \nweeks. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or greater, \nand who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either Docetaxel (T) \n75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/ m2 over 30-60 minutes every \n3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with carboplatin (AUC \n6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/ m2 administered over 6-10 \nminutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated \nevery 4 weeks (VCis). \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n28 \n \n\n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated in the \nfollowing table. \n \n TCis \n\nn=408 \nVCis \n\nn=404 \nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival \n(Primary endpoint) \n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]* \n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedium time to progression (weeks):  \n22.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n\nHazard ratio: 1.032 \n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \n\nOverall response rate (%) 31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n\n \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and region of \ntreatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung Cancer \nSymptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

A total of 445 \npatients with KPS>70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with \ncisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin \n(100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle \nwas 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm. The median number of cycles administered per \npatient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. \nTime to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was \nassociated with a significantly longer TTP (p=0.0004) in favor of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also \nsignificantly longer (p=0.0201) in favor of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. \nEfficacy results are summarized in the following table: \n \n\n \nEfficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma \n\nEndpoint TCF \nn=221 \n\nCF \nn=224 \n\nMedian TTP (months) \n(95%CI)  \n\n5.6 \n(4.86-5.91) \n\n3.7 \n(3.45-4.47) \n\nHazard  ratio  \n(95%CI)  \n*p-value \n\n1.473 \n(1.189-1.825) \n\n0.0004 \nMedian survival (months) 9.2 8.6 \n(95%CI)  \n2-year estimate (%)  \n \n\n9.2 \n(8.38-10.58) \n\n18.4 \n\n8.6 \n(7.16-9.46) \n\n8.8 \n\nHazard ratio  \n(95%CI)  \n*p-value \n\n1.293 \n(1.041-1.606) \n\n0.0201 \nOverall response rate (CR+PR) (%) 36.7 25.4 \np-value 0.0106 \nProgressive disease as best overall \nresponse (%) \n\n \n16.7 \n\n \n25.9 \n\n*Unstratified logrank test \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n30 \n \n\n \nSubgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favored the TCF arm compared to the CF arm. \n \nA survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed a \nstatistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the benefit \nof TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up. \n \nOverall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favor of the \nTCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global health status \non the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of Karnofsky \nperformance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. \n \n\n \nHead and neck cancer \n\n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of \nthe head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study \n(TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, and WHO perfomance \nstatus 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the docetaxel arm received \ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2  followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as \na continuous infusion for 5 days . This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at \nleast a minor response (\u2265 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after \n2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, \npatients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for \n7  weeks (TPF/RT). Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by  \n5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for \n4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was \nobserved after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal \ninterval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). \n Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy-2.0 Gy once \na day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of \nradiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of \n70 Gy was recommended for accelerated regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical \nresection was allowed following chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm \nreceived antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of \neach cycle, or equivalent. The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was \nsignificantly longer in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p=0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months \nrespectively) with an overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall \nsurvival was also significantly longer in favor of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median \nOS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 28% risk reduction of mortality, p=0.0128.  \nEfficacy results are presented in the table below: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n31 \n \n\nEfficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with inoperable locally advanced \n\n \nSCCHN (Intent-to-Treat Analysis) \n\nEndpoint Docetaxel+Cis+5-FU \nn=177 \n\nCis+5-FU \nn=181 \n\nMedian progression free survival (months) \n(95%CI) \n \n\n11.4 \n(10.1-14.0) \n\n8.3 \n(7.4-9.1) \n\nAdjusted hazard ratio \n(95%CI) \n*p-value \n\n0.70 \n(0.55-0.89) \n\n0.0042 \nMedian progression free survival (months) \n(95%CI) \n\n18.6 \n(15.7-24.0) \n\n14.5 \n(11.6-18.7) \n\nAdjusted Hazard ratio \n(95%CI) \n*p-value \n\n0.72 \n(0.56-0.93) \n\n0.0128 \nBest overall response to chemotherapy (%) \n(95%CI) \n***p-value \n\n67.8 \n(60.4-74.6) \n\n53.6 \n(46.0-61.0) \n\n0.006 \nBest overall response to study treatment \n[chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy] (%) \n(95%CI) \n***p-value \n\n72.3 \n(65.1-78.8) \n\n58.6 \n(51.0-65.8) \n\n0.006 \n\nMedian duration of response to chemotherapy \u00b1 \nradiotherapy (months) \n(95%CI) \n\nn=128 \n15.7 \n\n(13.4-24.6) \n\nn=106 \n11.7 \n\n(10.2-17.4) \nHazard ratio \n(95%CI) \n**p-value \n\n0.72 \n(0.52-0.99) \n\n0.0457 \nA hazard ratio of less than 1 favors Docetaxel +Cisplatin+5-FU \n*Cox model (adjustment for Primary tumour site, T and N clinical stages and PSWHO) \n**Logrank test \n*** Chi-square test \n \nQuality of life parameters \nPatients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score compared \nto those treated with PF (p=0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). \n \nClinical benefit parameters \nThe performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure understandability \nof speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favor of TPF as compared to PF.  \nMedian time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm \ncompared to PF.

In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and a WHO \nperformance status of 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two arms. The study population comprised patients \nwith technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure and patients aiming at \norgan preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival endpoints and the success \nof organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) \n75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute \nto three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) \n1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who \ndid not have progressive disease were to receive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT).  \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous \ninfusion on day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day \nfrom day 1 to day 5.  The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have \nprogressive disease were to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).   \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy with a \nminimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to day 56 of last \ncycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour intravenous infusion for \na maximum of 7 doses.  Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment using once daily fractionation \n(2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of \ndisease and/or neck could be considered at anytime following completion of CRT. All patients on the \ndocetaxel-containing arm of the study received prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in \nthis study, overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-\ncontaining regimen compared to PF (median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk \nreduction in mortality compared to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) \nwith an overall median follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% \nrisk reduction of progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF \nand 13.1 for PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.  \nEfficacy results are presented in the table below: \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n33 \n \n\n \nEfficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients  \n\n \nwith locally advanced SCCHN (Intent-to-Treat Analysis) \n\nEndpoint Docetaxel + Cis + 5-FU \nn = 255 \n\nCis + 5-FU \nn = 246 \n\nMedian overall survival (months)  \n(95% CI) \n\n70.6 \n(49.0-NA) \n\n30.1 \n(20.9-51.5) \n\nHazard ratio: \n(95% CI) \n*p-value  \n\n0.70 \n(0.54-0.90) \n\n0.0058 \nMedian PFS (months)  \n(95% CI) \n\n35.5 \n(19.3-NA) \n\n13.1 \n(10.6 - 20.2) \n\nHazard ratio: \n(95% CI) \n**p-value  \n\n0.71 \n(0.56 - 0.90) \n\n0.004 \nBest overall response (CR + PR) to chemotherapy \n(%) \n(95% CI) \n\n71.8 \n(65.8-77.2) \n\n64.2 \n(57.9-70.2) \n\n***p-value 0.070 \nBest overall response (CR + PR) to study treatment \n[chemotherapy +/- chemoradiotherapy] (%) \n(95%CI) \n\n76.5 \n(70.8-81.5) \n\n71.5 \n(65.5-77.1) \n\n***p-value 0.209 \nA hazard ratio of less than 1 favors docetaxel + cisplatin + fluorouracil \n*un-adjusted log-rank test \n**un-adjusted log-rank test, not adjusted for multiple comparisons \n***Chi square test, not adjusted for multiple comparisons \nNA-not applicable \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of \n20-115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with a \nthree-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, 36 min and \n11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the \nperipheral compartment. Following the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a \nmean peak plasma level of 3.7 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h \u03bcg/ml. Mean values \nfor total body clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% bound to \nplasma proteins. \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the \nurine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl ester group, \nwithin seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of the administered \nradioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is excreted during the first 48 \nhours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites and very low amounts of unchanged \nmedicinal product. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I studies. \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. In a small number of \npatients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment (ALT, \nAST \u22651.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \u22652.5 times the ULN), total clearance was \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n34 \n \n\nlowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to \nmoderate fluid retention and there are no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma levels \nof doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration.  \n \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by \ndocetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR.  \n \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumours had \nno influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard dexamethasone \npremedication has been studied in 42 patients. No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel \nwas observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration test in \nCHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce mutagenicity in \nthe Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent with the \npharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair male \nfertility. \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\n \nBreast cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of \npatients with: \n- operable node-positive breast cancer \n- operable node-negative breast cancer. \n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients \neligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of \nearly breast cancer (see section 5.1). \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. \n \nDocetaxel monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast \ncancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or \nan alkylating agent. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast \ncancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for \nmetastatic disease. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included \nan anthracycline. \n \n\n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\nDocetaxel is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung \ncancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n39 \n \n\n \nDocetaxel in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally \nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received \nchemotherapy for this condition.  \n \n\n \nProstate cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nhormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.  \n \n\n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n\nDocetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nmetastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have \nnot received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  \n \n\n \nHead and neck cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of \npatients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy \nand it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of anticancer \nchemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \nRecommended dose \n\nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). Prophylactic G-CSF may be \nused to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \nFor prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended premedication \nregimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section \n4.4). \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  \n\nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 \nevery 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n\nBreast cancer \n\nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in combination \ntherapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, with \ntrastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started the day \nfollowing the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered immediately \nafter completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was well tolerated. For \ntrastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen is \ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment after \nfailure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/ m2 as a single agent. \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily is \nadministered continuously (see section 5.1). \n\nProstate cancer \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2, as a \n1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per day given as a 24-hour \ncontinuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \n\nGastric adenocarcinoma \n\nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the risk of \nhaematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \n\nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after cisplatin \nadministration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. All \npatients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received prophylactic \nantibiotics. \n\nHead and neck cancer \n\n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and \nneck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by \ncisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at \n750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.  Following \nchemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy.   \n\n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability \nof surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck \n(SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1, \nfollowed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour infusion, followed by \n5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. This regimen is \nadministered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive \nchemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \n\n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n\nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \u22651,500 cells/mm3. In patients who \nexperienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for more than one week, severe or \ncumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel therapy, the dose of \ndocetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/ m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 60 mg/ m2. If the patient \ncontinues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m2, the treatment should be discontinued. \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC)adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile neutropenia \nand/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m2in all subsequent cycles \n\nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n41 \n \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should have their dose decreased \nto 60 mg/m2. \n \n\nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose nadir of \nplatelet count during the previous course of therapy is <25.000 cells/mm3, or in patients who experience \nfebrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel dose in subsequent \ncycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2.

If subsequent episodes of complicated \nneutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should not be \nretreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level > 1,500 cells/mm3 and \nplatelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these toxicities persist (see section \n4.4). \n\nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \n\nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3 First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. \nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment. \nStomatitis/mucositis grade 3 First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. \n\nStomatitis/mucositis grade 4 First episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies, patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide prophylactic \ncoverage (e.g. day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \n\n \nSpecial populations: \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range \n(ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of docetaxel is \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n42 \n \n\n75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin >ULN and/or ALT and AST \n>3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be \nrecommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, \nthe pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN associated with alkaline \nphosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be \nrecommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients \nwith hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications. \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less than 18 \nyears have not yet been established. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of docetaxel in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, non-small \ncell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including type II and III \nless differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. \nElderly \n\nIn combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of <1,500 cells/mm3. \n \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration, \nunless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of \nhypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, \n3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \n\n \nHaematology \n\nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of \n7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of complete \nblood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be retreated with \ndocetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \u22651,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of docetaxel \ntherapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate symptomatic \nmeasures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic G-CSF. \nPatients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of complicated \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n43 \n \n\nneutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TCF \nshould be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received primary G-CSF \nprophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive adjuvant therapy \nwith TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged \nneutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and second \ninfusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the infusion \nof docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should be available. If \nhypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised cutaneous reactions do not \nrequire interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe hypotension, bronchospasm or \ngeneralised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients \nwho have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. \n \n\n \nCutaneous reactions \n\nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema followed \nby desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which \nlead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see section 4.2). \n \n\n \nFluid retention \n\nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \n\n \nPatients with liver impairment \n\nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels (ALT \nand/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels greater than \n2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as toxic deaths \nincluding sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, infections, \nthrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel in those patients \nwith elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at baseline and before \neach cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels >ULN and/or ALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN concurrent with \nserum alkaline phosphatase levels >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel \nshould not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, \nthe pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST  > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN associated with alkaline \nphosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be \nrecommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients \nwith hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications. \n \n\n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. \n \n\n \nNervous system \n\nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n \nCardiac toxicity \n\nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may be \nmoderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they should \nundergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e.g. \nevery three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For more details see \nsummary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \n\n \nOthers \n\nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least 6  \nmonths after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n\nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n\nComplicated neutropenia \n\nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, may \nbe early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated promptly. \n\nGastrointestinal reactions \n\nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the follow \nup period. \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\nIn the docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treated patients, the risk of delayed \nmyelodysplasia or myeloid leukaemia requires haematological follow-up. \n\nLeukaemia \n\nThe benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ nodes was not defined fully at the interim analysis (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nPatients with 4+ nodes \n\nThere are limited data available in patients >70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n\nElderly \n\n \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients were \n65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with docetaxel every \nthree weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \u2265 10% higher in patients who were \n65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, \nand peripheral oedema occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus \nless than 65 years. \n \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) patients \ntreated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 74 were \n65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of serious adverse \nevents was higher in the elderly patients compared to younger patients. The incidence of the following \nadverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in \npatients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. \nElderly patients treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. \nEthanol \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n45 \n \n\n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the enzyme \ncompetitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin and \ntroleandomycin. As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal \nproducts as concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (>95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions with \ntightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone,phenytoin, \nsalicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. In addition, \ndexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not influence the binding of \ndigitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-\nadministration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction between \ndocetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was about 50% higher \nthan values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic prostate \ncancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. No statistically \nsignificant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals like ketoconazole or itraconazole). A drug \ninteraction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of \ndocetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves \nCYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower \ndoses. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be both \nembryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other cytotoxic \nmedicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, \ndocetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  \n \n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential /contraception: \n\nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after \ntreatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \n\n \nLactation: \n\nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n46 \n \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel have \nbeen obtained in: \n\u2022 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/ m2 and 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel as a single agent \n\nrespectively. \n\u2022 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. \n\u2022 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. \n\u2022  92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. \n\u2022 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\u2022 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically \n\nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\u2022 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received docetaxel in \n\ncombination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important treatment related adverse \nevents are presented). \n\n\u2022 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in \nthe phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically \nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; grade3-4 = G3/4; \ngrade 4 = G4) and the COSTART terms and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: very common \n(\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nvery rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was reversible \nand not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe neutropenia \n(<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea and asthenia. The \nseverity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in combination with other \nchemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There was \nan increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the trastuzumab \ncombination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) reported \nin a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see capecitabine \nsummary of product characteristics). \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \n\n \nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the infusion \nof docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms were flushing, rash \nwith or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized rash/erythema (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n \nNervous system disorders \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n47 \n \n\nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nMild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain including \nburning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \n\n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to moderate. \nReactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and hands (including \nsevere hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently associated with \npruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. Less frequently, severe \nsymptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to interruption or discontinuation \nof docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe nail disorders are characterised by \nhypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. \n \n\n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, redness or \ndryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. Fluid retention includes events such \nas peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The \nperipheral oedema usually starts at the lower extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of \n3 kg or more.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 \n \n\n \nPreclinical data \n\nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The binding of \ndocetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments.  \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital \nmitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against \nfreshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not \nall cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo, \ndocetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against \nadvanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \n\n \nClinical data \n\n \nBreast cancer \n\nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer\nData from a multicenter open label randomized study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment \nof patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \u2265 80%, between 18 and 70 years of age. After \nstratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to \nreceive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and \ncyclosphosphamide 500  mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 \ncycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given as \nintravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as secondary prophylaxis to patients who \nexperienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on \nthe TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days \nstarting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients \nwith positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. \n\n (TAX 316) \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n60 \n \n\nAdjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and \nwas given to 69% of patients who received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. \nAn interim analysis was performed with a median follow up of 55 months. Significantly longer disease-free \nsurvival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of relapses at 5 years was \nreduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC (25% versus 32%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute risk reduction by 7% (p=0.001). Overall survival at 5 years was also significantly increased \nwith TAC compared to FAC (87% versus 81%, respectively) i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death \nby 6% (p=0.008).

The effect appears to be less pronounced than in patients with 1-3 \npositive nodes. The benefit/risk ratio was not defined fully in patients with 4 and more positive nodes at this \nanalysis stage. \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy\n \n\n (GEICAM 9805) \n\nData from a multicenter open label randomized trial support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment \nof patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. 1060 patients were \nrandomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and \ncyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil \n500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable \nnode-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour \nsize > 2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 \nyears). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a \n1-hour infusion, all other drugs were given intravenously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomized. The incidence of Grade 4 \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who received primary \nG-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ \nand/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy \nwas administered according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of \npatients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. \n \nMedian duration of follow-up was 77 months. Significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). Overall \nsurvival (OS) was also longer in the TAC arm with TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk \nof death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29).

Without \naffecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or time to \nprogression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased response rate (52% \nvs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, p=0.007). Three docetaxel \npatients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 doxorubicin patients (9%) \ndiscontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart failure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate (33% \nvs. 12%, p<0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and prolonged \noverall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8).  \n \nAn open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel monotherapy \nand paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous therapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel monotherapy \n100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour infusion. Both regimens were \nadministered every 3 weeks. \n Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel prolonged \nmedian time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p<0.01) and median survival (15.3 months vs \n12.7 months; p=0.03).  \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to paclitaxel \n(23.0%). \n \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomized phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, \nhas been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) (AT arm) \nversus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600  mg/m\u00b2) (AC arm).

In this study, 255 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and \ncapecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). 256 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). \nSurvival was superior in the docetaxel +capecitabine combination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 \ndays (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days (docetaxel alone). \nThe overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 41.6% \n(docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to progressive disease was \nsuperior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p<0.0001). The median time to progression was \n186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \n\n \nNon-small Cell Lung Cancer \n\nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) and \noverall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive Care. The \n1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). There was less use \nof morphinic analgesic (p<0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p<0.01), other disease-related medications \n(p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p<0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to those with \nBSC.  \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 26.1 \nweeks. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n64 \n \n\nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or greater, \nand who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either Docetaxel (T) \n75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes every \n3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with carboplatin \n(AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 administered over 6-10 \nminutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated \nevery 4 weeks (VCis). \n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated in the \nfollowing table. \n \n TCis \n\nn=408 \nVCis \n\nn=404 \nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival \n(Primary endpoint) \n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]* \n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedium time to progression (weeks):  \n22.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n\nHazard ratio: 1.032 \n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \n\nOverall response rate (%) 31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n\n \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and region of \ntreatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung Cancer \nSymptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

A total of 445 \npatients with KPS>70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with \ncisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin \n(100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle \nwas 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm. The median number of cycles administered per \npatient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. \nTime to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was \nassociated with a significantly longer TTP (p=0.0004) in favor of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also \nsignificantly longer (p=0.0201) in favor of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. \n \nEfficacy results are summarized in the following table: \n \n\n \nEfficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma \n\nEndpoint TCF \nn=221 \n\nCF \nn=224 \n\nMedian TTP (months) \n(95%CI)  \n\n5.6 \n(4.86-5.91) \n\n3.7 \n(3.45-4.47) \n\nHazard  ratio  \n(95%CI)  \n*p-value \n\n1.473 \n(1.189-1.825) \n\n0.0004 \nMedian survival (months) 9.2 8.6 \n(95%CI)  \n2-year estimate (%)  \n \n\n9.2 \n(8.38-10.58) \n\n18.4 \n\n8.6 \n(7.16-9.46) \n\n8.8 \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n66 \n \n\nHazard ratio  \n(95%CI)  \n*p-value \n\n1.293 \n(1.041-1.606) \n\n0.0201 \nOverall response rate (CR+PR) (%) 36.7 25.4 \np-value 0.0106 \nProgressive disease as best overall \nresponse (%) \n\n \n16.7 \n\n \n25.9 \n\n*Unstratified logrank test \n \nSubgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favored the TCF arm compared to the CF arm. \n \nA survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed a \nstatistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the benefit \nof TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up. \n \nOverall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favor of the \nTCF arm.

In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, and WHO perfomance \nstatus 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the docetaxel arm received \ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2  followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as \na continuous infusion for 5 days . This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at \nleast a minor response (\u2265 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after \n2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, \npatients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for \n7 weeks (TPF/RT). Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by  \n5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 \ncycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was \nobserved after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal \ninterval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). \n Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy-2.0 Gy once \na day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of \nradiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of \n70 Gy was recommended for accelerated regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical \nresection was allowed following chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm \nreceived antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of \neach cycle, or equivalent. The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was \nsignificantly longer in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p=0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4  vs. 8.3 months \nrespectively) with an overall median follow up time of 33.7 months.

In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and a WHO \nperformance status of 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two arms. The study population comprised patients \nwith technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure and patients aiming at \norgan preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival endpoints and the success \nof organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) \n75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute \nto three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) \n1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who \ndid not have progressive disease were to receive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT).  \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous \ninfusion on day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day \nfrom day 1 to day 5.  The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have \nprogressive disease were to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).   \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy with a \nminimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to day 56 of last \ncycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour intravenous infusion for \na maximum of 7 doses.  Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment using once daily fractionation \n(2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of \ndisease and/or neck could be considered at anytime following completion of CRT.  All patients on the \ndocetaxel-containing arm of the study received prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in \nthis study, overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-\ncontaining regimen compared to PF (median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk \nreduction in mortality compared to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) \nwith an overall median follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% \nrisk reduction of progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF \nand 13.1 for PF).

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with a \nthree-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, 36 min and \n11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the \nperipheral compartment. Following the administration of a 100 mg/ m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a \nmean peak plasma level of 3.7 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h \u03bcg/ml. Mean values \nfor total body clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% bound to \nplasma proteins. \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the \nurine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl ester group, \nwithin seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of the administered \nradioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is excreted during the first 48 \nhours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites and very low amounts of unchanged \nmedicinal product. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I studies. \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. In a small number of \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n70 \n \n\npatients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment (ALT, \nAST \u22651.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \u22652.5 times the ULN), total clearance was \nlowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to \nmoderate fluid retention and there are no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma levels \nof doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration.  \n \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by \ndocetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR.  \n \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumours had \nno influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard dexamethasone \npremedication has been studied in 42 patients. No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel \nwas observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration test in \nCHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce mutagenicity in \nthe Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent with the \npharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair male \nfertility. \n \n6.

If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 24 hrs at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless reconstitution and further dilution has taken place in \ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions of the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nDocefrez 80 mg powder and solvent for concentrate  for solution for infusion \n \n\n15 ml colourless type 1 glass vial with grey bromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with a blood red colour \nflip-off aluminium seal \n\nPowder vial: \n\n \n\n5 ml colourless type 1  glass vial with grey bromobutyl rubber stopper sealed with brown colour flip-off \nwith aluminium seal. \n\nSolvent vial: \n\n \nEach carton contains: \n\u2022 one single-dose powder vial with 80 mg docetaxel (plus 18% overfill: 94.4 mg) and \n\u2022 one single-dose solvent vial with 4 ml solvent for docefrez (35.4% (w/w) ethanol in polysorbate 80) . \n \nThe overfills are included to ensure that, after dilution with the entire volume of the accompanying solvent \nvial, the minimum extractable volume of reconstituted concentrate containing 20 mg or 80 mg docetaxel, \nrespectively, may be withdrawn from the vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDocetaxel is an antineosplastic agent and, as with other potentially cytotoxic compounds, caution should be \nexercised when preparing docetaxel solutions. An appropriate aseptic technique should be used for all steps.  \n \nIf docetaxel powder, reconstituted concentrate  or solution for infusion should come into contact with skin, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If docetaxel powder, reconstituted concentrate, or \nsolution for infusion should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly \nwith water. \n \nBoth the reconstituted concentrate and the solution for infusion should be visually inspected prior to use. \nAny solution containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\nDo not use any PVC equipment or device. Docefrez is incompatible with PVC equipment or devices. \n\nDocefrez powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is for single use only. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n72 \n \n\nInstructions for reconstitution\n \n\n  \n\nMore than one vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. For example, a dose of \n140 mg docetaxel would require one 80 mg pack and three 20 mg packs. The required number of Docefrez \npowder vials should be allowed to reach room temperature (between 15\u00b0C - 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \nUsing a syringe with a needle, the entire contents of the correct vial of solvent for Docefrez is to be \nwithdrawn and injected into the respective Docefrez powder vials.  \nShake well for complete solubilisation of powder (the powder will be dissolved in less than 90 seconds).  \nThe reconstituted solution contains approximately 24 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation.  \n \n\n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \n\nAfter reconstitution, each vial contains an extractable volume of approx 3.36 ml concentrate, corresponding \nto approximately 80 mg docetaxel. \n \nThe volume of concentrate (24 mg/ml docetaxel) corresponding to the required dose (mg) for the patient \nshould be withdrawn (from the appropriate number of vials) using graduated syringes fitted with a needle.  \n \nThis volume of concentrate should be injected into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either glucose \n50 mg/ml (5%) solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nIf a dose greater than 200 mg docetaxel is required, a larger volume of the infusion vehicle should be used, \nso that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded in the final solution for infusion. \n \nThe solution in the infusion bag or bottle should be allowed to mix manually using a rocking motion. \n \n\n \nMethod of administration  \n\nThe docetaxel infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically administered as a \n1 hour infusion under room temperature and normal lighting conditions. \n \n\n \nDisposal \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

WHAT DOCEFREZ  IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nDocefrez contains the active substance docetaxel. Docetaxel, derived from yew-tree needles, belongs to a \ngroup of anti-cancer medicines called taxanes. \n \nDocefrez is used, either alone or in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of the following \nkinds of cancer:  \n- advanced breast cancer, alone or with doxorubicin, or trastuzumab, or capecitabine \n- early breast cancer with or without lymph node involvement, with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n- non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), alone or with cisplatin \n- prostate cancer, with prednisone or prednisolone \n- metastatic gastric cancer, with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \n- head and neck cancer, with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE DOCEFREZ \n \nDo not use Docefrez \n \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to docetaxel or any of the other ingredients of Docefrez \n- if your number of white blood cells is too low \n- if you have  severe liver disease \n- \n \nTake special care with Docefrez \n \nTell your doctor if you have: \n- heart problems  \n- liver problems \n- kidney problems \n \nBefore each Docefrez dose, you will have blood tests to check that your blood cell counts and liver function \nare adequate. \n \n \nUsing other medicines \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n88 \n \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription.  \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances: \n- ritonavir and other protease inhibitors, used to treat HIV infection/AIDS \n- ketoconazole and itraconazole, used to treat fungal infections \n- ciclosporin, used to suppress your immune system (e.g. after transplants) \n- erythromycin, antibiotic used for bacterial infections \n \nPregnancy  \n \nAsk your doctor for advice before being given any medicine. \n \nYou must not use Docefrez if you are pregnant unless clearly indicated by your doctor.  \n \nYou must not become pregnant during treatment with this medicine and must use an effective method of \ncontraception during therapy, because Docefrez may be harmful for the unborn baby. If pregnancy occurs \nduring your treatment, you must immediately inform your doctor. \n \nIf you are a man being treated with Docefrez you are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months \nafter treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because docetaxel may alter \nmale fertility. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nYou must not breast-feed while using Docefrez. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThere are no studies on the effects of Docefrez on the ability to drive and use machines. However, given that \nit can cause dizziness, tiredness and fainting, you should not drive or use machines if you experience any of \nthese side effects. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Docefrez \n \nThe solvent contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE DOCEFREZ \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose according to your body surface area in square metres (depends on \nweight and height) and your general condition.  \n \nYou will be given Docefrez by a healthcare professional in the hospital. It is administered through a drip \ninto a vein (intravenous infusion) for about one hour.

\nCONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION \n\nIt is important that you read the entire contents of this procedure prior to the preparation of either the \nDocefrez reconstituted solution or the Docefrez solution for infusion. \n\n1. FORMULATION \n\nThe Docefrez 20 mg powder is a white to off white lyophilised powder containing 20 mg (plus 22% overfill: \n24.4 mg) of docetaxel (anhydrous). The solvent for Docefrez is a 35.4% w/w solution of ethanol \n(anhydrous) in polysorbate 80. After reconstitution, 1 ml of concentrate contains 24 mg docetaxel. \n\n2. PRESENTATION \n\nDocefrez is supplied as single-dose vials. \n\nEach pack of Docefrez 20 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains one single-dose vial \nof docetaxel (anhydrous) (20 mg with corresponding fill of 24.4 mg as lyophilised powder) and a \ncorresponding single-dose vial with 1 ml of solvent consisting of 35.4% (w/w)of Ethanol (anhydrous)  in \nPolysorbate 80. \n\nThe overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire extractable volume of the accompanying solvent vial \nfor Docefrez, there is a minimal extractable reconstituted solution of 0.84 ml containing 20 mg docetaxel \n(anhydrous). \n\nDocefrez vials should be stored in a refrigerator. Do not freeze. Docefrez should not be used after the expiry \ndate shown on the carton and vials. \n\n2.1 Docefrez 20 mg powder vials \n\nDocefrez 20 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n\u2022 The Docefrez 20 mg vial contains a white to off white lyophilised powder in a 5 ml tubular colourless \nglass vial with 20 mm grey rubber stopper and sealed with dark green flip-off aluminium seal. \n\n\u2022 Each vial of Docefrez 20 mg contains 20 mg docetaxel (anhydrous) (plus 22% overfill: 24.4 mg \ndocetaxel). \n\n2.2 Docefrez 20 mg solvent vials \n\nThe solvent for Docefrez is 35.4% w/w Ethanol in Polysorbate 80. \n\nSolvent for Docefrez 20 mg, Powder for Solution for Infusion \n\n\u2022 The solvent vial for Docefrez 20 mg is a 1 ml colourless type 1 tubular glass vial with 20 mm grey \nbromobutyl rubber stopper sealed with 20 mm dark blue flip-off aluminium seal. \n\n\u2022 Each solvent vial of Docefrez 20 mg contains 1 ml of 35.4% w/w Ethanol in Polysorbate 80 \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n95 \n \n\nThe overfills are included to ensure that, after dilution with the entire volume of the accompanying solvent \nvial, the minimum extractable volume of reconstituted concentrate containing 20 mg or 80 mg docetaxel, \nrespectively, may be withdrawn from the vial. \n\n \n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n\nDocefrez is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be \nexercised when handling it and preparing Docefrez solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. \n\nIf Docefrez powder, reconstituted solution or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docefrez powder, reconstituted solution or infusion \nsolution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. \n\n4. PREPARATION FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n\nDo not use any PVC equipment or device. Docefrez is incompatible with PVC equipment or devices. \n\nDocefrez powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is for single use only. \n\n4.1 Reconstitution of Docefrez Powder for Solution for Infusion \n\n4.1.1 Allow the required number of Docefrez boxes which are stored in a refrigerator, to stand at room \ntemperature (below 25\u00baC) for 5 minutes. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocefrez vial by partially inverting the vial. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docefrez vial. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n96 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and shake well for complete solubilisation of powder. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4.1.5 Allow the reconstituted vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00baC) and then check \nthat the solution is homogenous and clear. \n \nThe reconstituted solution contains approximately 24 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 \nhours when stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n97 \n \n\n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n\n4.2.1 More than one vial of reconstituted solution may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the \npatient. Based on the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding \nvolume from the appropriate number of reconstituted solutions using graduated syringes fitted with a needle. \nFor example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require one 80 mg and three 20 mg packs. The reconstituted \nsolution contains ~ 24 mg/ml docetaxel, corresponding with an extractable volume of approximately \n20 mg/0.84 ml and 80 mg/3.36 ml. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4.2.2 Inject the required volume of reconstituted solution into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing \neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater than \n200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of \n0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n98 \n \n\n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.2.4 The Docefrez infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically administered \nas a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting conditions. \n \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Docefrez reconstituted solution and solution for infusion should be \nvisually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5.

following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: \n \n\nPREPARATION GUIDE FOR USE WITH DOCEFREZ 80 MG, POWDER AND SOLVENT FOR \nCONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION \n\nIt is important that you read the entire contents of this procedure prior to the preparation of either the \nDocefrez reconstituted solution or the Docefrez solution for infusion. \n\n1. FORMULATION \n\nThe Docefrez 80 mg powder is a white to off white lyophilised powder containing 80 mg (plus 18% overfill: \n94.4 mg) of docetaxel (anhydrous). The solvent for Docefrez is a solution of  35.4% w/w Ethanol \n(anhydrous) in Polysorbate 80. After reconstitution, 1 ml of concentrate contains 24 mg docetaxel \n\n2. PRESENTATION \n\nDocefrez is supplied as single-dose vials. \n\nEach pack of Docefrez 80 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains one single-dose vial \nof docetaxel (anhydrous) (80 mg  with corresponding fill of 94.4 mg as lyophilised powder) and a \ncorresponding single-dose vial with 4.0 ml of solvent consisting of  35.4% (w/w) of Ethanol (anhydrous)  in \nPolysorbate 80. \n\nThe overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire extractable volume of the accompanying solvent vial \nfor Docefrez, there is a minimal extractable reconstituted solution of 3.36 ml containing 80 mg docetaxel \n(anhydrous). \n\nDocefrez vials should be stored in a refrigerator. Do not freeze. Docefrez should not be used after the expiry \ndate shown on the carton and vials. \n\n2.1 Docefrez 80 mg powder vials \n\nDocefrez 80 mg, Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion \n\n\u2022 The Docefrez 80 mg vial contains a white to off white lyophilised powder in a 15 ml tubular colourless \nglass vial with 20 mm grey rubber stopper and sealed with red flip-off aluminium seal. \n\n\u2022 Each vial of Docefrez 80 mg contains 80 mg docetaxel (anhydrous) (plus 18% overfill: 94.4 mg \ndocetaxel). \n\n \n2.2 Docefrez 80 mg solvent vials \n \nThe solvent for Docefrez is 35.4% w/w Ethanol in Polysorbate 80. \n\nSolvent for Docefrez 80 mg, Powder for Solution for Infusion \n\n\u2022 The solvent vial for Docefrez 80 mg is a 5 ml colourless type 1 tubular glass vial with 20 mm grey \nbromobutyl rubber stopper sealed with 20 mm brown flip-off aluminium seal. \n\n\u2022 Each solvent vial of Docefrez 80 mg contains 4 ml of 35.4% w/w ethanol in Polysorbate 80. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n107 \n \n\nThe overfills are included to ensure that, after dilution with the entire volume of the accompanying solvent \nvial, the minimum extractable volume of reconstituted concentrate containing 20 mg or 80 mg docetaxel, \nrespectively, may be withdrawn from the vial. \n\n \n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n\nDocefrez is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be \nexercised when handling it and preparing Docefrez solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. \n\nIf Docefrez powder, reconstituted solution or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docefrez powder, reconstituted solution or infusion \nsolution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. \n\n4. PREPARATION FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n\nDo not use any PVC equipment or device. Docefrez is incompatible with PVC equipment or devices. \n\nDocefrez powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is for single use only. \n\n4.1 Reconstitution of Docefrez Powder for Solution for Infusion \n\n4.1.1 Allow the required number of Docefrez boxes which are stored in a refrigerator, to stand at room \ntemperature (below 25\u00baC) for 5 minutes. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocefrez vial by partially inverting the vial. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docefrez vial. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n108 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and shake well for complete solubilisation of powder. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4.1.5 Allow the reconstituted vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00baC) and then check \nthat the solution is homogenous and clear. \n \nThe reconstituted solution contains approximately 24 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 \nhours when stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n109 \n \n\n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n\n4.2.1 More than one vial of reconstituted solution may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the \npatient. Based on the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding \nvolume from the appropriate number of reconstituted solutions using graduated syringes fitted with a needle. \nFor example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require one 80 mg and three 20 mg packs. The reconstituted \nsolution contains ~ 24 mg/ml docetaxel, corresponding with an extractable volume of approximately \n20 mg/0.84 ml and 80 mg/3.36 ml. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4.2.2 Inject the required volume of reconstituted solution into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing \neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater than \n200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of \n0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n110 \n \n\n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4.2.4 The Docefrez infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically administered \nas a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting conditions. \n \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Docefrez reconstituted solution and solution for infusion should be \nvisually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5.

docefrez 5 further information 1 what docefrez is and what it is used for docefrez contains the active substance docetaxel. docetaxel, derived from yew-tree needles, belongs to a group of anti-cancer medicines called taxanes. docefrez is used, either alone or in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of the following kinds of cancer: - advanced breast cancer, alone or with doxorubicin, or trastuzumab, or capecitabine - early breast cancer with or without lymph node involvement, with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide - non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), alone or with cisplatin - prostate cancer, with prednisone or prednisolone - metastatic gastric cancer, with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil - head and neck cancer, with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. 2 before you use docefrez do not use docefrez - if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to docetaxel or any of the other ingredients of docefrez - if your number of white blood cells is too low - if you have severe liver disease take special care with docefrez tell your doctor if you have: - heart problems - liver problems - kidney problems before each docefrez dose, you will have blood tests to check that your blood cell counts and liver function are adequate. using other medicines 100 please tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. in particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances: - ritonavir and other protease inhibitors, used to treat hiv infection/aids - ketoconazole and itraconazole, used to treat fungal infections - ciclosporin, used to suppress your immune system (e.g. after transplants) - erythromycin, antibiotic used for bacterial infections pregnancy ask your doctor for advice before being given any medicine. you must not use docefrez if you are pregnant unless clearly indicated by your doctor. you must not become

in the hospital. it is administered through a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion) for about one hour. you should usually receive your docefrez infusion every three weeks. your doctor may change the dose and/or frequency of administration depending on the results of your blood tests, your general condition and the occurence of certain side effects. tell your doctor or nurse if you have fever, diarrhoea, sores in the mouth, feeling of numbness or pins and needles. your doctor may prescribe you other medicines before or during treatment with docefrez: - to minimise allergic reactions and fluid retention (pre-treatment with an oral corticoid such as dexamethasone), - to stimulate your bone marrow to produce more blood cells (e.g. filgrastim). if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 4. possible side effects like all medicines, docefrez can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. side effects may occur with certain
