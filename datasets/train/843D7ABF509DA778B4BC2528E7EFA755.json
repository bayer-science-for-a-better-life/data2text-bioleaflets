CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency and/or urgency incontinence as \nmay occur in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (including elderly patients) \nThe recommended dose is 50 mg once daily \n \nSpecial populations \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nBetmiga has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or \npatients requiring haemodialysis) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and it is \ntherefore not recommended for use in these patient populations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nThe following table provides the daily dosing recommendations for subjects with renal or hepatic \nimpairment in the absence and presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Daily dosing recommendations for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment in the \nabsence and presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors \n\n  Strong CYP3A inhibitors(3) \n  Without inhibitor With inhibitor \nRenal impairment(1) Mild 50 mg 25 mg \n\nModerate 50 mg 25 mg \nSevere 25 mg Not recommended \n\nHepatic impairment(2) Mild 50 mg 25 mg \nModerate 25 mg Not recommended \n\n1. Mild: GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2; moderate: GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; severe: GFR \n15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2. \n\n2. Mild: Child-Pugh Class A; Moderate: Child-Pugh Class B. \n3. Strong CYP3A inhibitors see section 4.5 \n \nGender \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary according to gender. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of mirabegron in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe tablet is to be taken with liquids, swallowed whole and is not to be chewed, divided, or crushed. It \nmay be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Severe uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic \n\nblood pressure \u2265 110 mm Hg. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal impairment \n \nBetmiga has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or \npatients requiring haemodialysis) and, therefore, it is not recommended for use in this patient \npopulation. Data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2); \nbased on a pharmacokinetic study (see section 5.2) a dose reduction to 25 mg is recommended in this \npopulation. This medicinal product is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBetmiga has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and, \ntherefore, it is not recommended for use in this patient population. This medicinal product is not \nrecommended for use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) concomitantly \nreceiving strong CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n \nHypertension \n \nMirabegron can increase blood pressure. Blood pressure should be measured at baseline and \nperiodically during treatment with mirabegron, especially in hypertensive patients. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nData are limited in patients with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265 160 mm Hg or \ndiastolic blood pressure \u2265 100 mm Hg). \n \nPatients with congenital or acquired QT prolongation \n \nBetmiga, at therapeutic doses, has not demonstrated clinically relevant QT prolongation in clinical \nstudies (see section 5.1). However, since patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients \nwho are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval were not included in these \nstudies, the effects of mirabegron in these patients is unknown. Caution should be exercised when \nadministering mirabegron in these patients. \n \nPatients with bladder outlet obstruction and patients taking antimuscarinics medicinal products for \nOAB \n \nUrinary retention in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and in patients taking \nantimuscarinic medicinal products for the treatment of OAB has been reported in postmarketing \nexperience in patients taking mirabegron. A controlled clinical safety study in patients with BOO did \nnot demonstrate increased urinary retention in patients treated with Betmiga; however, Betmiga should \nbe administered with caution to patients with clinically significant BOO. Betmiga should also be \nadministered with caution to patients taking antimuscarinic medicinal products for the treatment of \nOAB. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro data \n \nMirabegron is transported and metabolised through multiple pathways. Mirabegron is a substrate for \ncytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2D6, butyrylcholinesterase, uridine \ndiphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the influx \norganic cation transporters (OCT) OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3. Studies of mirabegron using human liver \nmicrosomes and recombinant human CYP enzymes showed that mirabegron is a moderate and \ntimedependent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Mirabegron inhibited \nP-gp-mediated drug transport at high concentrations. \n \nIn vivo data \n \nDrug-drug interactions \nThe effect of co-administered medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron and the \neffect of mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products was studied in single and \nmultiple dose studies. Most drug-drug interactions were studied using a dose of 100 mg mirabegron \ngiven as oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) tablets. Interaction studies of mirabegron with \nmetoprolol and with metformin used mirabegron immediate-release (IR) 160 mg. \n \nClinically relevant drug interactions between mirabegron and medicinal products that inhibit, induce \nor are a substrate for one of the CYP isozymes or transporters are not expected except for the \ninhibitory effect of mirabegron on the metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates. \n \nEffect of enzyme inhibitors \n\nMirabegron exposure (AUC) was increased 1.8-fold in the presence of the strong inhibitor of \nCYP3A/P-gp ketoconazole in healthy volunteers. No dose-adjustment is needed when Betmiga is \ncombined with inhibitors of CYP3A and/or P-gp. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (GFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) or mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) \nconcomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir and \nclarithromycin, the recommended dose is 25 mg once daily with or without food (see section 4.2). \nBetmiga is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n(GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) \nconcomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nEffect of enzyme inducers \n\nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A or P-gp decrease the plasma concentrations of mirabegron. No \ndose adjustment is needed for mirabegron when administered with therapeutic doses of rifampicin or \nother CYP3A or P-gp inducers. \n \nEffect of CYP2D6 polymorphism \nCYP2D6 genetic polymorphism has minimal impact on the mean plasma exposure to mirabegron (see \nsection 5.2). Interaction of mirabegron with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor is not expected and was not \nstudied. No dose adjustment is needed for mirabegron when administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or \nin patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. \n \nEffect of mirabegron on CYP2D6 substrates \nIn healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of mirabegron towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the \nCYP2D6 activity recovers within 15 days after discontinuation of mirabegron. Multiple once daily \ndosing of mirabegron IR resulted in a 90% increase in Cmax and a 229% increase in AUC of a single \ndose of metoprolol. Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron resulted in a 79% increase in Cmax and a \n241% increase in AUC of a single dose of desipramine. \n \nCaution is advised if mirabegron is co-administered with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic \nindex and significantly metabolised by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., \nflecainide, propafenone) and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, desipramine). Caution is also \nadvised if mirabegron is co-administered with CYP2D6 substrates that are individually dose titrated. \n \nEffect of mirabegron on transporters \nMirabegron is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Mirabegron increased Cmax and AUC by 29% and 27%, \nrespectively, of the P-gp substrate digoxin in healthy volunteers. For patients who are initiating a \ncombination of mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should be prescribed initially. \nSerum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain \nthe desired clinical effect. The potential for inhibition of P-gp by mirabegron should be considered \nwhen Betmiga is combined with sensitive P-gp substrates e.g. dabigatran. \n \nOther interactions \n\nNo clinically relevant interactions have been observed when mirabegron was co-administered with \ntherapeutic doses of solifenacin, tamsulosin, warfarin, metformin or a combined oral contraceptive \nmedicinal product containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Dose-adjustment is not \nrecommended. \n \nIncreases in mirabegron exposure due to drug-drug interactions may be associated with increases in \npulse rate. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWoman of childbearing potential \n \nBetmiga is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of Betmiga in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). This medicinal product is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nMirabegron is excreted in the milk of rodents and therefore is predicted to be present in human milk \n(see section 5.3). No studies have been conducted to assess the impact of mirabegron on milk \nproduction in humans, its presence in human breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. \n \nBetmiga should not be administered during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no treatment-related effects of mirabegron on fertility in animals (see section 5.3). The \neffect of mirabegron on human fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBetmiga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Betmiga was evaluated in 8433 patients with OAB, of which 5648 received at least one \ndose of mirabegron in the phase 2/3 clinical program, and 622 patients received Betmiga for at least \n1 year (365 days). In the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies, 88% of the \npatients completed treatment with this medicinal product, and 4% of the patients discontinued due to \nadverse events. Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported for patients treated with Betmiga 50 mg during the three \n12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies are tachycardia and urinary tract infections. \nThe frequency of tachycardia was 1.2% in patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. Tachycardia led to \ndiscontinuation in 0.1% patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. The frequency of urinary tract infections \nwas 2.9% in patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. Urinary tract infections led to discontinuation in none \nof the patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. Serious adverse reactions included atrial fibrillation (0.2%). \n \nAdverse reactions observed during the 1-year (long term) active controlled (muscarinic antagonist) \nstudy were similar in type and severity to those observed in the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, \nplacebo controlled studies. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below reflects the adverse reactions observed with mirabegron in the three 12-week phase \n3 double blind, placebo controlled studies. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be established from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMedDRA \nSystem organ \nclass \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nVery rare Not known \n(cannot be \nestimated \nfrom the \navailable \ndata) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nUrinary tract \ninfection \n\nVaginal infection \nCystitis \n\n   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n    Insomnia* \nConfusional \nstate* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache* \nDizziness* \n\n    \n\nEye disorders   Eyelid oedema   \nCardiac \ndisorders \n\nTachycardia Palpitation \nAtrial fibrillation \n\n   \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n   Hypertensive \ncrisis* \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea* \nConstipation* \nDiarrhoea* \n\nDyspepsia \nGastritis \n \n\nLip oedema   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Urticaria \nRash \nRash macular \nRash papular \nPruritus \n\nLeukocytoclastic \nvasculitis \nPurpura \nAngioedema* \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Joint swelling    \n\nRenal and \nurinary disorders \n\n  Urinary \nretention* \n\n  \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n Vulvovaginal \npruritus \n\n   \n\nInvestigations  Blood pressure \nincreased \nGGT increased \nAST increased \nALT increased \n\n   \n\n*observed during post-marketing experience \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nMirabegron has been administered to healthy volunteers at single doses up to 400 mg. At this dose, \nadverse events reported included palpitations (1 of 6 subjects) and increased pulse rate exceeding \n100 beats per minute (bpm) (3 of 6 subjects). Multiple doses of mirabegron up to 300 mg daily for \n10 days showed increases in pulse rate and systolic blood pressure when administered to healthy \nvolunteers. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTreatment for overdose should be symptomatic and supportive. In the event of overdose, pulse rate, \nblood pressure, and ECG monitoring is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, urinary antispasmodics ATC code: G04BD12. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMirabegron is a potent and selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist. Mirabegron showed relaxation of \nbladder smooth muscle in rat and human isolated tissue, increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate \n(cAMP) concentrations in rat bladder tissue and showed a bladder relaxant effect in rat urinary bladder \nfunction models. Mirabegron increased mean voided volume per micturition and decreased the \nfrequency of non-voiding contractions, without affecting voiding pressure, or residual urine in rat \nmodels of bladder overactivity. In a monkey model, mirabegron showed decreased voiding frequency. \nThese results indicate that mirabegron enhances urine storage function by stimulating \nbeta 3-adrenoceptors in the bladder. \n \nDuring the urine storage phase, when urine accumulates in the bladder, sympathetic nerve stimulation \npredominates. Noradrenaline is released from nerve terminals, leading predominantly to beta \nadrenoceptor activation in the bladder musculature, and hence bladder smooth muscle relaxation. \nDuring the urine voiding phase, the bladder is predominantly under parasympathetic nervous system \ncontrol. Acetylcholine, released from pelvic nerve terminals, stimulates cholinergic M2 and M3 \nreceptors, inducing bladder contraction. The activation of the M2 pathway also inhibits \nbeta 3-adrenoceptor induced increases in cAMP. Therefore beta 3-adrenoceptor stimulation should not \ninterfere with the voiding process. This was confirmed in rats with partial urethral obstruction, where \nmirabegron decreased the frequency of non-voiding contractions without affecting the voided volume \nper micturition, voiding pressure, or residual urine volume. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nUrodynamics \n\nBetmiga at doses of 50 mg and 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks in men with lower urinary tract \nsymptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) showed no effect on cystometry parameters \nand was safe and well tolerated. The effects of mirabegron on maximum flow rate and detrusor \npressure at maximum flow rate were assessed in this urodynamic study consisting of 200 male patients \nwith LUTS and BOO. Administration of mirabegron at doses of 50 mg and 100 mg once daily for \n12 weeks did not adversely affect the maximum flow rate or detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate. \nIn this study in male patients with LUTS/BOO, the adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline to end of \ntreatment in post void residual volume (mL) was 0.55 (10.702), 17.89 (10.190), 30.77 (10.598) for the \nplacebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg treatment groups. \n \nEffect on QT interval \nBetmiga at doses of 50 mg or 100 mg had no effect on the QT interval individually corrected for heart \nrate (QTcI interval) when evaluated either by sex or by the overall group. \n \nA thorough QT (TQT) study (n = 164 healthy male and n = 153 healthy female volunteers with a mean \nage of 33 years) evaluated the effect of repeat oral dosing of mirabegron at the indicated dose (50 mg \nonce daily) and two supra-therapeutic doses (100 and 200 mg once daily) on the QTcI interval. The \nsupra-therapeutic doses represent approximately 2.6- and 6.5-fold the exposure of the therapeutic dose, \nrespectively. A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin was used as a positive control. Each dose level of \nmirabegron and moxifloxacin was evaluated in separate treatment arms each including placebo-control \n(parallel cross-over design). For both males and females administered mirabegron at 50 mg and \n\n\n\n9 \n\n100 mg, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval did not exceed 10 msec at any time \npoint for the largest time-matched mean difference from placebo in the QTcI interval. In females \nadministered mirabegron at the 50 mg dose, the mean difference from placebo on QTcI interval at \n5 hours post dose was 3.67 msec (upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI 5.72 msec). In males, the \ndifference was 2.89 msec (upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI 4.90 msec). At a mirabegron dose of \n200 mg, the QTcI interval did not exceed 10 msec at any time point in males, while in females the \nupper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval did exceed 10 msec between 0.5\u20136 hours, with \na maximum difference from placebo at 5 hours where the mean effect was 10.42 msec (upper bound of \nthe one-sided 95% CI 13.44 msec). Results for QTcF and QTcIf were consistent with QTcI. \n \nIn this TQT study, mirabegron increased heart rate on ECG in a dose dependent manner across the \n50 mg to 200 mg dose range examined. The maximum mean difference from placebo in heart rate \nranged from 6.7 bpm with mirabegron 50 mg up to 17.3 bpm with mirabegron 200 mg in healthy \nsubjects. \n \nEffects on pulse rate and blood pressure in patients with OAB \nIn OAB patients (mean age of 59 years) across three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled \nstudies receiving Betmiga 50 mg once daily, an increase in mean difference from placebo of \napproximately 1 bpm for pulse rate and approximately 1 mm Hg or less in systolic blood \npressure/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) was observed. Changes in pulse rate and blood pressure \nare reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. \n \nEffect on intraocular pressure (IOP) \nMirabegron 100 mg once daily did not increase IOP in healthy subjects after 56 days of treatment. In a \nphase 1 study assessing the effect of Betmiga on IOP using Goldmann applanation tonometry in \n310 healthy subjects, a dose of mirabegron 100 mg was non-inferior to placebo for the primary \nendpoint of the treatment difference in mean change from baseline to day 56 in subject-average IOP; \nthe upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the treatment difference between mirabegron 100 mg and \nplacebo was 0.3 mm Hg. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy of Betmiga was evaluated in three phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 12-\nweek studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urgency and frequency with or \nwithout incontinence. Female (72%) and male (28%) patients with a mean age of 59 years (range 18 \u2013\n 95 years) were included. The study population consisted of approximately 48% antimuscarinic \ntreatment na\u00efve patients as well as approximately 52% patients previously treated with antimuscarinic \nmedicinal products. In one study, 495 patients received an active control (tolterodine prolonged release \nformulation). \n \nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints were (1) change from baseline to end of treatment in mean number \nof incontinence episodes per 24 hours and (2) change from baseline to end of treatment in mean \nnumber of micturitions per 24 hours based on a 3-day micturition diary. Mirabegron demonstrated \nstatistically significant larger improvements compared to placebo for both co-primary endpoints as \nwell as secondary endpoints (see Tables 2 and 3). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable

The absolute bioavailability increased from 29% \nat a dose of 25 mg to 35% at a dose of 50 mg. Mean Cmax and AUC increased more than dose \nproportionally over the dose range. In the overall population of males and females, a 2-fold increase in \ndose from 50 mg to 100 mg mirabegron increased Cmax and AUCtau by approximately 2.9- and \n2.6-fold, respectively, whereas a 4-fold increase in dose from 50 mg to 200 mg mirabegron increased \nCmax and AUCtau by approximately 8.4- and 6.5-fold. Steady state concentrations are achieved within \n7 days of once daily dosing with mirabegron. After once daily administration, plasma exposure of \nmirabegron at steady state is approximately double that seen after a single dose. \n \nEffect of food on absorption \n \nCo-administration of a 50 mg tablet with a high-fat meal reduced mirabegron Cmax and AUC by 45% \nand 17%, respectively. A low-fat meal decreased mirabegron Cmax and AUC by 75% and 51%, \nrespectively. In the phase 3 studies, mirabegron was administered with or without food and \ndemonstrated both safety and efficacy. Therefore, mirabegron can be taken with or without food at the \nrecommended dose. \n \nDistribution \n \nMirabegron is extensively distributed. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is approximately \n1670 L. Mirabegron is bound (approximately 71%) to human plasma proteins, and shows moderate \naffinity for albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Mirabegron distributes to erythrocytes. In vitro \nerythrocyte concentrations of 14C-mirabegron were about 2-fold higher than in plasma. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMirabegron is metabolised via multiple pathways involving dealkylation, oxidation, (direct) \nglucuronidation, and amide hydrolysis. Mirabegron is the major circulating component following a \nsingle dose of 14C-mirabegron. Two major metabolites were observed in human plasma; both are \nphase 2 glucuronides representing 16% and 11% of total exposure. These metabolites are not \npharmacologically active. \n \nBased on in vitro studies, mirabegron is unlikely to inhibit the metabolism of co-administered \nmedicinal products metabolised by the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 because mirabegron did not inhibit the activity of these \nenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Mirabegron did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A. \nMirabegron is predicted not to cause clinically relevant inhibition of OCT-mediated drug transport. \n \nAlthough in vitro studies suggest a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the oxidative metabolism of \nmirabegron, in vivo results indicate that these isozymes play a limited role in the overall elimination. \nIn vitro and ex vivo studies have shown the involvement from butyrylcholinesterase, UGT and \npossibly alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the metabolism of mirabegron, in addition to CYP3A4 and \nCYP2D6. \n \nCYP2D6 polymorphism \nIn healthy subjects who are genotypically poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates (used as a \nsurrogate for CYP2D6 inhibition), mean Cmax and AUCinf of a single 160 mg dose of a mirabegron IR \nformulation were 14% and 19% higher than in extensive metabolisers, indicating that CYP2D6 genetic \npolymorphism has minimal impact on the mean plasma exposure to mirabegron. Interaction of \nmirabegron with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor is not expected and was not studied. No dose adjustment \nis needed for mirabegron when administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are CYP2D6 \npoor metabolisers. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nElimination \n \nTotal body clearance (CLtot) from plasma is approximately 57 L/h. The terminal elimination half-life \n(t1/2) is approximately 50 hours. Renal clearance (CLR) is approximately 13 L/h, which corresponds to \nnearly 25% of CLtot. Renal elimination of mirabegron is primarily through active tubular secretion \nalong with glomerular filtration. The urinary excretion of unchanged mirabegron is dose-dependent \nand ranges from approximately 6.0% after a daily dose of 25 mg to 12.2% after a daily dose of \n100 mg. Following the administration of 160 mg 14C-mirabegron to healthy volunteers, approximately \n55% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 34% in the faeces. Unchanged mirabegron \naccounted for 45% of the urinary radioactivity, indicating the presence of metabolites. Unchanged \nmirabegron accounted for the majority of the faecal radioactivity. \n \nAge \n \nThe Cmax and AUC of mirabegron and its metabolites following multiple oral doses in elderly \nvolunteers (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger volunteers (18\u201345 years). \n \nGender \n \nThe Cmax and AUC are approximately 40% to 50% higher in females than in males. Gender differences \nin Cmax and AUC are attributed to differences in body weight and bioavailability. \n \nRace \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of mirabegron are not influenced by race. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nFollowing single dose administration of 100 mg Betmiga in volunteers with mild renal impairment \n(eGFR-MDRD 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2), mean mirabegron Cmax and AUC were increased by 6% and \n31% relative to volunteers with normal renal function. In volunteers with moderate renal impairment \n(eGFR-MDRD 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), Cmax and AUC were increased by 23% and 66%, \nrespectively. In volunteers with severe renal impairment (eGFR-MDRD 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), \nmean Cmax and AUC values were 92% and 118% higher. Mirabegron has not been studied in patients \nwith end stage renal disease (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients requiring haemodialysis). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing single dose administration of 100 mg Betmiga in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class A), mean mirabegron Cmax and AUC were increased by 9% and 19% relative to \nvolunteers with normal hepatic function. In volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClass B), mean Cmax and AUC values were 175% and 65% higher. Mirabegron has not been studied in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPre-clinical studies have identified target organs of toxicity that are consistent with clinical \nobservations. Transient increases in liver enzymes and hepatocyte changes (necrosis and decrease in \nglycogen particles) were seen in rats. An increase in heart rate was observed in rats, rabbits, dogs and \nmonkeys. Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have shown no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential \nin vivo. \n \nNo effects on fertility were seen at sub-lethal doses (human equivalent dose was 19-fold higher than \nthe maximum human recommended dose (MHRD)). The main findings in rabbit embryofetal \ndevelopment studies included malformations of the heart (dilated aorta, cardiomegaly) at systemic \nexposures 36-fold higher than observed at the MHRD. In addition, malformations of the lung (absent \n\n\n\n17 \n\naccessory lobe of the lung) and increased post-implantation loss were observed in the rabbit at \nsystemic exposures 14-fold higher than observed at the MHRD, while in the rat reversible effects on \nossification were noted (wavy ribs, delayed ossification, decreased number of ossified sternebrae, \nmetacarpi or metatarsi) at systemic exposures 22-fold higher than observed at the MHRD. The \nobserved embryofetal toxicity occurred at doses associated with maternal toxicity. The cardiovascular \nmalformations observed in the rabbit were shown to be mediated via activation of the \nbeta 1-adrenoceptor. \n \nPharmacokinetic studies performed with radio-labelled mirabegron have shown that the parent \ncompound and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats at levels that were approximately \n1.7-fold higher than plasma levels at 4 hours post administration (see section 4.6). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Betmiga is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Betmiga \n3. How to take Betmiga \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Betmiga \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Betmiga is and what it is used for \n \nBetmiga contains the active substance mirabegron. It is a bladder muscle relaxant (a so called \nbeta 3-adrenoceptor agonist), which reduces the activity of an overactive bladder and treats the related \nsymptoms. \n \nBetmiga is used to treat the symptoms of an overactive bladder in adults such as: \n- suddenly needing to empty your bladder (called urgency) \n- having to empty your bladder more than usual (called increased urinary frequency) \n- not being able to control when to empty your bladder (called urgency incontinence) \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Betmiga \n \nDo not take Betmiga: \n- if you are allergic to mirabegron or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you have very high uncontrolled blood pressure. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Betmiga: \n- if you have trouble emptying your bladder or you have a weak urine stream or if you take other \n\nmedicines for the treatment of overactive bladder such as anticholinergic medicines. \n- if you have kidney or liver problems. Your doctor may need to reduce your dose or may tell you \n\nnot to take Betmiga, especially if you are taking other medicines such as itraconazole, \nketoconazole (fungal infections), ritonavir (HIV/AIDS) or clarithromycin (bacterial infections). \nTell your doctor about the medicines that you take. \n\n- if you have an ECG (heart tracing) abnormality known as QT prolongation or you are taking \nany medicine known to cause this such as \n\no medicines used for abnormal heart rhythm such as quinidine, sotalol, procainamide, \nibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, and amiodarone; \n\no medicines used for allergic rhinitis; \n\n\n\n40 \n\no antipsychotic medicines (medicines for mental illness) such as thioridazine, \nmesoridazine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine; \n\no anti-infectives such as pentamidine, moxifloxacin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. \n \nMirabegron may cause your blood pressure to increase or make your blood pressure worse if you have \na history of high blood pressure. It is recommended that your doctor check your blood pressure while \nyou are taking Mirabegron \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and \nefficacy of Betmiga in this age group has not been established. \n \nOther medicines and Betmiga \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nBetmiga may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how this medicine \nworks. \n- Tell your doctor if you use thioridazine (a medicine for mental illness), propafenone or \n\nflecainide (medicines for abnormal heart rhythm), imipramine or desipramine (medicines used \nfor depression). These specific medicines may require dose adjustment by your doctor. \n\n- Tell your doctor if you use digoxin (a medicine for heart failure or abnormal heart rhythm). \nBlood levels of this medicine are measured by your doctor. If the blood level is out of range, \nyour doctor may adjust the dose of digoxin. \n\n- Tell your doctor if you use dabigatran etexilate (a medicine which is used to reduce the risk of \nbrain or body vessel obstruction by blood clot formation in adult patients with an abnormal \nheart beat (atrial fibrillation) and additional risk factors). This medicine may require dose \nadjustment by your doctor. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby you should not take \nBetmiga. \n \nIf you are breast feeding, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is \nlikely that this medicine passes into your breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you should \ntake Betmiga or breastfeed. You should not do both. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere is no information to suggest that this medicine affects your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Betmiga \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one 50 mg tablet by mouth once daily. If you have kidney or liver \nproblems, your doctor may need to reduce your dose to one 25 mg tablet by mouth once daily. You \nshould take this medicine with liquids and swallow the tablet whole. Do not crush or chew the tablet. \nBetmiga can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Betmiga than you should \nIf you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes \nyour tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist or hospital for advice immediately. \n \nSymptoms of overdose may include a forceful beating of the heart, an increased pulse rate or an \nincreased blood pressure. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nIf you forget to take Betmiga \nIf you forget to take your medicine, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is less than \n6 hours before your next scheduled dose, skip the dose and continue to take your medicine at the usual \ntime. \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you miss several doses, tell your doctor \nand follow the advice given to you. \n \nIf you stop taking Betmiga \nDo not stop treatment with Betmiga early if you do not see an immediate effect. Your bladder might \nneed some time to adapt. You should continue taking your tablets. Do not stop taking them when your \nbladder condition improves. Stopping treatment may result in recurrence of symptoms of overactive \nbladder. \n \nDo not stop taking Betmiga without talking to your doctor first, as your overactive bladder symptoms \nmay come back. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most serious side effects may include irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation).
