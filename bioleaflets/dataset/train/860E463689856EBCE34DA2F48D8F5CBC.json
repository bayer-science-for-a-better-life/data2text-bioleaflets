NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nARIKAYCE liposomal 590 mg nebuliser dispersion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains amikacin sulfate equivalent to 590 mg amikacin in a liposomal formulation. The \nmean delivered dose per vial is approximately 312 mg of amikacin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNebuliser dispersion \n \nWhite, milky, aqueous, nebuliser dispersion. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nARIKAYCE liposomal is indicated for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung \ninfections caused by Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in adults with limited treatment options \nwho do not have cystic fibrosis (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nARIKAYCE liposomal treatment should be initiated and managed by physicians experienced in the \ntreatment of non-tuberculous lung disease due to Mycobacterium avium Complex. \n \nARIKAYCE liposomal should be used in conjunction with other antibacterial agents active against \nMycobacterium avium Complex lung infections. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is one vial (590 mg) administered once daily, by oral inhalation.  \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin, as part of a combination antibacterial regimen, should be \ncontinued for 12 months after sputum culture conversion.  \n \nTreatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should not continue beyond a maximum of 6 months if \nsputum culture conversion (SCC) has not been confirmed by then. \n \nThe maximum duration of treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should not exceed 18 months. \n \nMissed doses \nIf a daily dose of amikacin is missed, the next dose should be administered the next day. A double \ndose should not be given to make up for the missed dose. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nInhaled liposomal amikacin has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose \nadjustments based on hepatic impairment are required since amikacin is not hepatically metabolised. \n \nRenal impairment \nInhaled liposomal amikacin has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Use is \ncontraindicated in severe renal impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of inhaled liposomal amikacin in paediatric patients below 18 years of age \nhave not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInhalation use \n \nInhaled liposomal amikacin must only be used with the Lamira Nebuliser System (nebuliser handset, \naerosol head and controller). For instructions for use, see section 6.6. It must not be administered by \nany other route or using any other type of inhalation delivery system. \n \nARIKAYCE liposomal is administered only using a Lamira Nebuliser System. Like all other \nnebulised treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend upon patient factors. Under \nrecommended in vitro testing with the adult breathing pattern (500 mL tidal volume, 15 breaths per \nminute, and inhalation: exhalation ration of 1:1), the mean delivered dose from the mouthpiece was \napproximately 312 mg of amikacin (approximately 53% of label claim) with an average drug delivery \nrate of 22.3 mg/min assuming the nebulisation time of 14 minutes. The average mass median \naerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the nebulised aerosol droplets is about 4.7 \u00b5m with D10 of 2.4 \u00b5m \nand D90 of 9.0 \u00b5m as determined using the next generation impactor method. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any aminoglycoside antibacterial agent, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to soya. \n \nCo-administration with any aminoglycoside administered via any route of administration. \n \nSevere renal impairment. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAnaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions \n \nSerious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been \nreported in patients taking inhaled liposomal amikacin. \n \nBefore therapy with inhaled liposomal amikacin is instituted, an evaluation for previous \nhypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides should take place. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity \nreaction occurs, inhaled liposomal amikacin should be discontinued and appropriate supportive \nmeasures should be instituted. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAllergic alveolitis \n \nAllergic alveolitis and pneumonitis have been reported with the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin in \nclinical studies (see section 4.8). \n \nIf allergic alveolitis occurs, treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should be discontinued and \npatients should be treated as medically appropriate. \n \nBronchospasm \n \nBronchospasm has been reported with the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin in clinical studies. In \npatients with a history of reactive airway disease, asthma or bronchospasm, inhaled liposomal \namikacin should be administered after using a short-acting bronchodilator. If there is evidence of \nbronchospasm due to inhaled liposomal amikacin inhalation, the patient may be pre-treated with \nbronchodilators (see section 4.8). \n \nExacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease \n \nIn clinical trials, exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infective exacerbation of \nbronchiectasis) was reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with inhaled liposomal \namikacin compared with patients not receiving inhaled liposomal amikacin. Caution should be \nexercised when initiating inhaled liposomal amikacin in patients presenting with these underlying \nconditions. Discontinuation of treatment with inhaled liposomal amikacin should be considered if \nsigns of exacerbation are observed. \n \nOtotoxicity \n \nIn clinical trials, ototoxicity, (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) was \nreported with a higher frequency in patients treated with inhaled liposomal amikacin compared with \npatients not receiving inhaled liposomal amikacin. Tinnitus was the most commonly reported \nototoxicity related adverse reaction.  \n \nAuditory and vestibular function should be monitored periodically in all patients and frequent \nmonitoring is advised in patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction.  \n \nIf ototoxicity occurs during treatment, consideration should be given to discontinuing inhaled \nliposomal amikacin. \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nNephrotoxicity was reported in clinical trials in patients treated with inhaled liposomal amikacin. \nRenal function should be monitored periodically during treatment in all patients and frequent \nmonitoring is advised in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.  \nConsideration should be given to stopping inhaled liposomal amikacin in patients who develop \nevidence of nephrotoxicity on treatment.  \n \nUse in patients with severe renal impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nNeuromuscular blockade \n \nIn clinical trials, neuromuscular disorders (reported as muscle weakness, neuropathy peripheral and \nbalance disorder) have been reported with inhaled liposomal amikacin. Aminoglycosides may \naggravate muscle weakness because of a curare-like effect at the neuromuscular junction. Use of \n\n\n\n5 \n\ninhaled liposomal amikacin in patients with myasthenia gravis is not recommended. Patients with any \nknown or suspected neuromuscular disorders should be closely monitored. \n \nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n \nCo-administration of inhaled liposomal amikacin with other aminoglycosides is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nCo-administration with any other medicinal product affecting auditory function, vestibular function or \nrenal function (including diuretics) is not recommended. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with inhaled liposomal amikacin. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nUse of inhaled liposomal amikacin with any aminoglycoside administered by any route is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nConcurrent and/or sequential use of inhaled liposomal amikacin is not recommended with other \nmedicinal products with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential that can enhance \naminoglycoside toxicity (e.g. diuretic compounds such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide or intravenous \nmannitol) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin in pregnant women. Systemic exposure \nto amikacin following inhalation of inhaled liposomal amikacin is expected to be low compared to \nparenteral administration of amikacin.  \n \nThere are limited data from the use of aminoglycosides in pregnant women. Aminoglycosides can \ncause foetal harm. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and there have been reports of total, \nirreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in children, whose mothers received streptomycin during \npregnancy. Although adverse reactions on the foetus or newborns have not been reported in pregnant \nwomen treated with other aminoglycosides, the potential for harm exists. Animal reproductive toxicity \nstudies have not been conducted with inhaled amikacin. In reproductive toxicity studies in mice, rats \nand rabbits with amikacin administered parenterally, no foetal malformations were reported. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of inhaled liposomal amikacin during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is no information regarding the presence of amikacin in human milk. However, systemic \nexposure to inhaled liposomal amikacin following inhalation is expected to be low compared to \nparenteral administration of amikacin.  \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from inhaled \nliposomal amikacin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies were conducted with inhaled liposomal amikacin. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAmikacin has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The administration of inhaled \nliposomal amikacin can cause dizziness and other vestibular disturbances (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be advised not to drive or operate machinery while using inhaled liposomal amikacin.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most commonly reported respiratory adverse reactions were dysphonia (42.6%), cough (30.9%), \ndyspnoea (14.4%), haemoptysis (10.9%), oropharyngeal pain (9.2%), and bronchospasm (2.2%). \nOther commonly reported non-respiratory adverse reactions included fatigue (7.2%), diarrhoea (6.4%), \ninfective exacerbation of bronchiectasis (6.2%), and nausea (5.9%). \n \nMost common serious adverse reactions included Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) \n(1.5%), haemoptysis (1.2%), and infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis (1.0%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions in Table 1 are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA based on \nclinical trials and post marketing data. Within each system organ class, the following definitions apply \nto the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known: \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Summary of adverse reactions \n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency \n\ncategory \nInfections and infestations Infective exacerbation of \n\nbronchiectasis \nCommon \n\n Laryngitis Common \n Oral candidiasis Common \n   \nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reactions Not known \n Hypersensitivity reactions Not known \n   \nPsychiatric disorders Anxiety Uncommon \n   \nNervous system disorders Headache Common \n Dizziness Common \n Dysgeusia Common \n Aphonia Common \n Balance disorder Common \n   \nEar and labyrinth disorders Tinnitus Common \n Deafness Common \n   \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal  Dysphonia Very common \ndisorders Dyspnoea Very common \n Cough Very common \n Haemoptysis Very common \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency \ncategory \n\n Oropharyngeal pain Common \n Allergic alveolitis Common \n Chronic Obstructive \n\nPulmonary Disease \nCommon \n\n Wheezing Common \n Productive cough Common \n Sputum increased Common \n Bronchospasm Common \n Pneumonitis Common \n Vocal cord inflammation Common \n Throat irritation Common \n   \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common \n Nausea Common \n Vomiting Common \n Dry mouth Common \n Decrease of appetite Common \n   \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash Common \n Pruritus Common \n   \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia Common \n\n Arthralgia Common \n   \nRenal and urinary disorders Renal impairment Common \n   \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue Common \n\n Pyrexia Common \n Chest discomfort Common \n   \nInvestigations Weight decreased Common \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAdverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of inhaled liposomal amikacin have not been \nidentified in clinical trials. Overdose in subjects with pre-existing impaired renal function, deafness or \nvestibular disturbance, or impaired neuromuscular transmission may develop worsening of the pre-\nexisting disorder. \n \nIn the event of an overdose inhaled liposomal amikacin should be stopped immediately. Where rapid \nremoval of amikacin is indicated to prevent target organ damage, for example in subjects with renal \nimpairment, peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis will accelerate the extraction of amikacin from blood. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other aminoglycosides. ATC code: \nJ01GB06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAmikacin binds to a specific receptor protein on the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and interferes \nwith an initiation complex between mRNA (messenger RNA) and the 30S subunit resulting in \ninhibition of protein synthesis. \n \nResistance \n \nThe mechanism of resistance to amikacin in mycobacteria has been linked to mutations in the rrs gene \nof the 16S rRNA. \n \nClinical experience \n \nThe efficacy of inhaled liposomal amikacin was evaluated in study INS-212, a randomised, open-label \nstudy in adult patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung infections caused by MAC. \n \nPatients who had not achieved sputum culture conversion (SCC) while being treated with Multiple \nDrug Regimen(s) (MDR) for at least 6 months before study entry were randomised to receive \nARIKAYCE in addition to their MDR treatment or to continue with MDR alone. Patients achieving \nSCC, defined as 3 consecutive negative MAC sputum cultures by month 6 on treatment continued \ntherapy for up to 12 months after achieving SCC. Those not achieving SCC by month 6 were \ndiscontinued from the study at month 8.  \n \nA total of 335 patients were randomised and dosed (ARIKAYCE liposomal + MDR n = 223; MDR \nalone n = 112) (Safety population). Median duration of prior MDR treatment was 2.6 years and \n2.4 years in the ARIKAYCE liposomal + MDR and MDR alone group, respectively. Patients were \nstratified per smoking status (current smoker or not) and MDR use at screening (on treatment or off \ntreatment for at least 3 months prior to screening). The primary endpoint was durable SCC defined as \nthe proportion of randomised patients that had achieved SCC by month 6 on treatment and had no \npositive solid media culture or no more than two broth media cultures by 3 months off treatment. \n \nSixty-five (29.0%) and 10 (8.9%) patients achieved SCC by month 6 on treatment in the ARIKAYCE \nliposomal + MDR and the MDR group, respectively (p< 0.0001). Of these, based on the primary \nanalysis durable SCC at 3 months off treatment was achieved by 16.1% [36/224] vs. 0% [0/112]; p-\nvalue <0.0001.  \n \nIn a post-hoc analysis that eliminated patients with negative cultures (solid media or broth) at study \nbaseline and which counted any post-treatment positive culture (solid media or broth) as positive, \n30/224 (13.4%) in the ARIKAYCE liposomal + MDR group and 0/112 (0%) in the MDR group \nachieved durable SCC at 3 months off treatment. Respective rates at 12 months off treatment were \n25/224 (11%) vs. 0/112 (0%). \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ninhaled liposomal amikacin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in NTM lung infection \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nSputum concentrations \nFollowing once daily inhalation of 590 mg inhaled liposomal amikacin in MAC patients, sputum \nconcentrations at 1 to 4 hours post-inhalation were 1720, 884, and 1300 \u00b5g/g at 1, 3, and 6 months, \nrespectively. High variability in amikacin concentrations was observed (CV% > 100%). After \n48 to 72 hours post-inhalation, amikacin sputum concentrations decreased to approximately 5% of \nthose at 1 to 4 hours post-inhalation. \n \nSerum concentrations \nFollowing daily inhalation of 590 mg ARIKAYCE in MAC patients, at steady state, the median serum \nAUC0-24 was 16.7 \u00b5g *hr/mL (range: 4.31 to 55.6 \u00b5g *hr/mL; n = 53) and the median serum Cmax was \n1.81 \u00b5g/mL (range: 0.482 to 6.87 \u03bcg/mL; n = 53). \n \nDistribution \n \nAmikacin is \u2264 10% bound to serum proteins. The mean total apparent volume of distribution has been \nestimated to be approximately 5.0 L/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAmikacin is not metabolised. \n \nElimination \n \nAmikacin is excreted in the urine unchanged, primarily by glomerular filtration. The median apparent \nterminal serum half-life of amikacin after inhalation of ARIKAYCE liposomal ranged from \napproximately 3.29 to 14.0 hrs. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis for ARIKAYCE liposomal in 53 subjects with NTM lung \ndisease aged 20 to 84 years indicated that amikacin clearance is 34 L/h. The only clinical covariate \nidentified to be predictive of amikacin clearance was body weight. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nIn a 2-year inhalation carcinogenicity study with inhaled liposomal amikacin in rats at doses of 5, 15, \nand 45 mg/kg/day, squamous cell carcinoma was observed in the lungs of 2 of 120 rats (0/60 males \nand 2/60 females) administered the highest dose tested (45 mg/kg/day). This ARIKAYCE dose was \n6-fold greater than the clinical dose when normalised on a lung weight basis. No squamous cell \ncarcinoma was observed at the mid-dose of 15 mg/kg/day, which was 2-fold greater than the clinical \ndose when normalised on a lung weight basis. The squamous cell carcinomas may be the result of a \nhigh lung burden of particulates from inhaled liposomal amikacin in the rat lung. The relevance of the \nlung tumour findings with regards to humans receiving inhaled liposomal amikacin is unknown. In \ndogs administered inhaled liposomal amikacin daily by inhalation for 9 months at doses up to \n30 mg/kg/day, no preneoplastic or neoplastic changes were observed in the lungs (approximately \n3 to 11 times the recommended human dose based on lung weight). \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nNo evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in a battery of in vitro and in vivo \ngenotoxicity studies with liposomal amikacin formulations (in vitro microbial mutagenesis test, in \nvitro mouse lymphoma mutation assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration study, and an in vivo \nmicronucleus study in rats). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nReproductive and development toxicity \n \nAnimal reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with inhaled amikacin. In non-GLP \nreproduction toxicology studies in mice and rats with parenterally administered amikacin, no effect of \nfertility or foetal toxicity was reported.  \n \n \n6.
