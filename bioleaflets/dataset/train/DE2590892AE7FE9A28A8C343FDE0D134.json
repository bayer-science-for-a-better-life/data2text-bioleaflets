CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of influenza \nEbilfumin is indicated in adults and children including full-term neonates who present with symptoms \ntypical of influenza, when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Efficacy has been \ndemonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of first onset of symptoms.  \n \nPrevention of influenza \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n- Post-exposure prevention in individuals 1 year of age or older following contact with a \nclinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. \n\n \n- The appropriate use of Ebilfumin for prevention of influenza should be determined on a case \n\nby case basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection. In exceptional \nsituations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a \npandemic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age or \nolder. \n\n \n- Ebilfumin is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of \n\nage during a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2). \n \nEbilfumin is not a substitute for influenza vaccination. \n \nThe use of antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza should be determined on the basis of \nofficial recommendations. Decisions regarding the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxis \nshould take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating influenza \nviruses, available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns for each season and the impact \nof the disease in different geographical areas and patient populations (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nEbilfumin hard capsules are bioequivalent formulations. 75 mg doses can be administered as \neither: \n- one 75 mg capsule or \n- one 30 mg capsule plus one 45 mg capsule. \n \nCommercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product \nfor paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded. \n \nAdults, and adolescents 13 years and over \n \nTreatment: The recommended oral dose is 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days for adolescents (13 \nto 17 years of age) and adults. \n \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 5 days \n> 40 kg 75 mg twice daily \n\n \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of \ninfluenza. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: The recommended dose for prevention of influenza following close contact \nwith an infected individual is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for 10 days for adolescents (13 to 17 years \nof age) and adults. \n \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 10 days \n> 40 kg 75 mg once daily \n\n \nTherapy should begin as soon as possible within two days of exposure to an infected individual. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: The recommended dose for prevention of \ninfluenza during a community outbreak is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for up to 6 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years of age \n \nEbilfumin 30 mg, 45 mg and 75 mg capsules are available for infants and children 1 year of age or \nolder \n \nTreatment: The following weight-adjusted dosing regimens are recommended for treatment of infants \nand children 1 year of age or older: \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 5 days \n10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg 75 mg twice daily \n\n \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of \ninfluenza. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: The recommended post-exposure prevention dose of Ebilfumin is: \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 10 days \n10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg once daily \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg once daily \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg once daily \n> 40 kg 75 mg once daily \n\n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: Prevention during an influenza epidemic \nhas not been studied in children below 12 years of age. \n \nInfants 0 \u2013 12 months of age \n \nTreatment: The recommended treatment dose for infants 0 - 12 months of age is 3 mg/kg twice daily. \nThis is based upon pharmacokinetic and safety data indicating that this dose in infants 0 - 12 months \nprovides plasma concentrations of the pro-drug and active metabolite that are anticipated to be \nclinically efficacious with a safety profile comparable to that seen in older children and adults (see \nsection 5.2). The following dosing regimen is recommended for treatment of infants 0 - 12 months of \nage: \n \n\nBody weight* Recommended dose for 5 days \n3 kg 9 mg twice daily \n4 kg 12 mg twice daily \n5 kg 15 mg twice daily \n6 kg 18 mg twice daily \n7 kg 21 mg twice daily \n8 kg 24 mg twice daily \n9 kg 27 mg twice daily \n10 kg 30 mg twice daily \n\n* This table is not intended to contain all possible weights for this population. For all patients under the age of 1 \nyear, 3 mg/kg should be used to determine dose regardless of the weight of the patient. \n \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of \ninfluenza. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nThis dosing recommendation is not intended for premature infants, i.e. those with a post-\nconceptual age less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are available for these patients, in whom \ndifferent dosing may be required due to the immaturity of physiological functions. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: The recommended prophylaxis dose for infants less than 1 year of age \nduring a pandemic influenza outbreak is half of the daily treatment dose. This is based upon clinical \ndata in infants and children 1 year of age or older and adults showing that a prophylaxis dose \nequivalent to half the daily treatment dose is clinically efficacious for the prevention of influenza. The \nfollowing age-adjusted dosing prophylaxis regimen is recommended for infants 0 \u2013 12 months of age \n(see Section 5.2 for exposure simulation): \n \n\nAge Recommended dose for 10 days \n0 - 12 months 3 mg/kg once daily \n\n \nThis dosing recommendation is not intended for premature infants, i.e. those with a post-\nconceptual age less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are available for these patients, in whom \ndifferent dosing may be required due to the immaturity of physiological functions. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: Prevention during an influenza epidemic \nhas not been studied in children 0-12 months of age. \n \nFor instructions on preparing the extemporaneous formulation, see section 6.6.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required either for treatment or for prevention in patients with hepatic \ndysfunction. No studies have been carried out in paediatric patients with hepatic disorder. \n \nRenal impairment \nTreatment of influenza: Dose adjustment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of \nage) with moderate or severe renal impairment. Recommended doses are detailed in the table below. \n\nCreatinine clearance Recommended dose for treatment \n> 60 (ml/min) 75 mg twice daily \n\n> 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg twice daily \n> 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg once daily \n\n\u2264 10 (ml/min) Not recommended (no data available) \nHaemodialysis patients 30 mg after each haemodialysis session \n\nPeritoneal dialysis patients* 30 mg single dose \n* Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients; the clearance of \noseltamivir carboxylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. \nTreatment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a nephrologist. \n \nPrevention of influenza: Dose adjustment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years \nof age) with moderate or severe renal impairment as detailed in the table below. \n\nCreatinine clearance Recommended dose for prevention \n> 60 (ml/min) 75 mg once daily \n\n> 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg once daily \n> 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg every second day \n\n\u2264 10 (ml/min) Not recommended (no data available) \nHaemodialysis patients 30 mg after every second haemodialysis session \n\nPeritoneal dialysis patients* 30 mg once weekly \n* Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients; the clearance of \noseltamivir carboxylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. \nTreatment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a nephrologist. \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \nThere is insufficient clinical data available in infants and children (12 years of age and younger) with \nrenal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required, unless there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \nTreatment: The recommended oral dose is 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily for 10 days for adults (see \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two \ndays of onset of symptoms of influenza.  \n \nSeasonal prophylaxis: Longer duration of seasonal prophylaxis up to 12 weeks has been evaluated \nin immunocompromised patients (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules may receive appropriate extemporaneous \nformulation, see section 6.6 for preparation. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOseltamivir is effective only against illness caused by influenza viruses. There is no evidence for \nefficacy of oseltamivir in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses (see section 5.1). \n \nOseltamivir is not a substitute for influenza vaccination \n \nUse of oseltamivir must not affect the evaluation of individuals for annual influenza vaccination. The \nprotection against influenza lasts only as long as oseltamivir is administered. Oseltamivir should be \nused for the treatment and prevention of influenza only when reliable epidemiological data indicate \nthat influenza virus is circulating in the community. Susceptibility of circulating influenza virus strains \nto oseltamivir has been shown to be highly variable (see section 5.1). Therefore, prescribers should \ntake into account the most recent information available on oseltamivir susceptibility patterns of the \ncurrently circulating viruses when deciding whether to use oseltamivir. \n \nSevere concomitant condition \n \nNo information is available regarding the safety and efficacy of oseltamivir in patients with any \nmedical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring \nhospitalisation. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \n \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in either treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised \npatients has not been firmly established. However, the duration of treatment of influenza in \nimmunocompromised adult patients should be 10 days, as there are no studies of a shorter course \nof oseltamivir in this patient group (see section 5.1). \n \nCardiac / respiratory disease \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nEfficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of subjects with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory \ndisease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observed \nbetween the treatment and placebo groups in this population (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data allowing a dose recommendation for premature children (< 36 weeks post-conceptual age) are \ncurrently available. \n \nSevere renal impairment \n \nDose adjustment is recommended for both treatment and prevention in adolescents (13 to 17 years of \nage) and adults with severe renal impairment. There is insufficient clinical data available in infants and \nchildren (1 year of age or older) with renal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nNeuropsychiatric events \n \nNeuropsychiatric events have been reported during administration of oseltamivir in patients with \ninfluenza, especially in children and adolescents. These events are also experienced by patients with \ninfluenza without oseltamivir administration. Patients should be closely monitored for behavioural \nchanges, and the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully evaluated for each \npatient (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipient \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir, such as low protein binding and metabolism independent of \nthe CYP450 and glucuronidase systems (see section 5.2), suggest that clinically significant drug \ninteractions via these mechanisms are unlikely. \n \nProbenecid \n \nNo dose adjustment is required when co-administering with probenecid in patients with normal renal \nfunction. Co-administration of probenecid, a potent inhibitor of the anionic pathway of renal tubular \nsecretion, results in an approximate 2-fold increase in exposure to the active metabolite of oseltamivir. \n \nAmoxicillin \n \nOseltamivir has no kinetic interaction with amoxicillin, which is eliminated via the same pathway, \nsuggesting that oseltamivir interaction with this pathway is weak. \n  \nRenal elimination \n \nClinically important drug interactions involving competition for renal tubular secretion are unlikely, \ndue to the known safety margin for most of these substances, the elimination characteristics of the \nactive metabolite (glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion) and the excretion capacity of \nthese pathways. However, care should be taken when prescribing oseltamivir in subjects when taking \nco-excreted agents with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. chlorpropamide, methotrexate, \nphenylbutazone). \n \nAdditional information \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions between oseltamivir or its major metabolite have been observed \nwhen co-administering oseltamivir with paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, cimetidine, antacids \n(magnesium and aluminium hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine or warfarin (in subjects \nstable on warfarin and without influenza). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nInfluenza is associated with adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes, with a risk of major congenital \nmalformations, including congenital heart defects. A large amount of data on oseltamivir exposure of \npregnant women from post-marketing reports and observational studies (more than 1000 exposed \noutcomes during the first trimester) indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity by \noseltamivir.  \n \nHowever, in one observational study, while the overall malformation risk was not increased, the \nresults for major congenital heart defects diagnosed within 12 months of birth were not conclusive. In \nthis study, the rate of major congenital heart defects following oseltamivir exposure during the first \ntrimester was 1.76% (7 infants out of 397 pregnancies) compared to 1.01% in unexposed pregnancies \nfrom the general population (Odds Ratio 1.75, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 to 5.98). The clinical \nsignificance of this finding is not clear, as the study had limited power. Additionally, this study was \ntoo small to reliably assess individual types of major malformations; moreover women exposed to \noseltamivir and women unexposed could not be made fully comparable, in particular whether or not \nthey had influenza. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of Ebilfumin may be considered during pregnancy if necessary and after considering the \navailable safety and benefit information (for data on benefit in pregnant women please refer to section \n5.1 \u201ctreatment of influenza in pregnant women\u201d), and the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza \nvirus strain. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIn lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in milk. Very limited information is \navailable on children breast-fed by mothers taking oseltamivir and on excretion of oseltamivir in breast \nmilk. Limited data demonstrated that oseltamivir and the active metabolite were detected in breast \nmilk, however the levels were low, which would result in a subtherapeutic dose to the infant. \nConsidering this information, the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain and the \nunderlying condition of the breastfeeding woman, administration of oseltamivir may be considered, \nwhere there are clear potential benefits to breastfeeding mothers. \n \nFertility \n \nBased on preclinical data, there is no evidence that oseltamivir has an effect on male or female fertility \n(see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOseltamivir has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nThe overall safety profile of oseltamivir is based on data from 6049 adult/adolescent and 1473 \npaediatric patients treated with oseltamivir or placebo for influenza, and on data from 3990 \nadult/adolescent and 253 paediatric patients receiving oseltamivir or placebo/no treatment for the \nprophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials. In addition, 199 immunocompromised adult patients \nreceived oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza and 475 immunocompromised patients (including \n18 children, of these 10 oseltamivir and 8 placebo) received oseltamivir or placebo for the prophylaxis \nof influenza. \n \nIn adults/adolescents, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (ARs) were nausea and vomiting \nin the treatment studies, and nausea in the prevention studies. The majority of these ARs were reported \non a single occasion on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1-2 \ndays. In children, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was vomiting. In the majority of \npatients, these ARs did not lead to discontinuation of oseltamivir. \n \nThe following serious adverse reactions have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been \nmarketed: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, \nhepatic function disorder and jaundice), angioneurotic oedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and \ntoxic epidermal necrolysis, gastrointestinal bleeding and neuropsychiatric disorders. \n(Regarding neuropsychiatric disorders, see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe ARs listed in the tables below fall into the following categories: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and very rare \n(< 1/10,000). ARs are added to the appropriate category in the tables according to the pooled \nanalysis from clinical studies. \n \nTreatment and prevention of influenza in adults and adolescents: \nIn adult/adolescent treatment and prevention studies, ARs that occurred the most frequently at \nthe recommended dose (75 mg bid for 5 days for treatment and 75 mg od for up to 6 weeks \nfor prophylaxis) are shown in Table 1. \n \nThe safety profile reported in subjects who received the recommended dose of oseltamivir for \nprophylaxis (75 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks) was qualitatively similar to that seen in the \ntreatment studies, despite a longer duration of dosing in the prophylaxis studies. \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions in studies investigating oseltamivir for treatment and \n\nprevention of influenza in adults and adolescents or through post-marketing \nsurveillance \n\n \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Bronchitis, \nHerpes simplex, \nNasopharyngitis, \nUpper respiratory \ntract infections, \nSinusitis \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n   Thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity \nreaction \n\nAnaphylactic \nreactions, \nAnaphylactoid \nreactions \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n   Agitation, \nAbnormal behaviour, \nAnxiety, \nConfusion, \nDelusions, Delirium, \nHallucination, \nNightmares, \nSelf-injury \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Insomnia Altered level of \nconsciousness, \nConvulsion \n\n \n\nEye disorders    Visual disturbance \nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Cardiac \narrhythmia \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough, \nSore throat, \nRhinorrhea \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Vomiting \nAbdominal pain \n(incl. upper \nabdominal pain), \nDyspepsia \n\n Gastrointestinal \nbleedings, \nHaemorrhagic \ncolitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes \n\nFulminant hepatitis, \nHepatic failure, \nHepatitis \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Eczema, \nDermatitis, Rash, \nUrticaria \n\nAngioneurotic \noedema, \nErythema \nmultiforme, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Pain \nDizziness (incl. \nvertigo), \nFatigue, \nPyrexia , \nPain in limb \n\n  \n\n \nTreatment and prevention of influenza in children: \nA total of 1473 children (including otherwise healthy children aged 1-12 years old and asthmatic \nchildren aged 6-12 years old) participated in clinical studies of oseltamivir given for the treatment \nof influenza. Of those, 851 children received treatment with oseltamivir suspension. A total of 158 \nchildren received the recommended dose of oseltamivir once daily in a post-exposure prophylaxis \nstudy in households (n = 99), a 6-week paediatric seasonal prophylaxis study (n = 49) and a 12-\nweek paediatric seasonal prophylaxis study in immunocompromised subjects (n = 10). \n \nTable 2 shows the most frequently reported ARs from paediatric clinical trials. \nTable 2 Adverse reactions in studies investigating oseltamivir for treatment and \n\nprevention of influenza in children (age/weight-based dosing [30 mg to 75 mg \no.d.]) \n\n \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Otitis media,   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache   \n\nEye disorders:  Conjunctivitis \n(including red \neyes, eye \ndischarge and eye \npain) \n\n  \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders: \n\n Earache Tympanic \nmembrane disorder \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough, \nNasal congestion \n\nRhinorrhoea   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVomiting Abdominal pain \n(incl. upper \nabdominal pain), \nDyspepsia, \nNausea \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Dermatitis \n(including allergic \nand atopic \ndermatitis) \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPsychiatric disorders and nervous system disorders \nInfluenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioural symptoms which can \ninclude events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behaviour, in some cases resulting in \nfatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur \nwithout obvious severe disease. \n \nIn patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir, there have been postmarketing reports of \nconvulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of consciousness, confusion, \nabnormal behaviour, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares), in a very few cases \nresulting in self-injury or fatal outcomes. These events were reported primarily among paediatric and \nadolescent patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of \noseltamivir to those events is unknown. Such neuropsychiatric events have also been reported in \npatients with influenza who were not taking oseltamivir. \n \nHepato-biliary disorders \nHepato-biliary system disorders, including hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes in patients \nwith influenza-like illness. These cases include fatal fulminant hepatitis/hepatic failure. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPaediatric population (infants less than one year of age) \nIn two studies to characterise the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile of \noseltamivir therapy in 135 influenza infected children less than one year of age, the safety profile was \nsimilar among age cohorts with vomiting, diarrohea and diaper rash being the most frequently \nreported adverse events (see section 5.2). Insufficient data are available for infants who have a post-\nconceptual age of less than 36 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nSafety information available on oseltamivir administered for treatment of influenza in infants less \nthan one year of age from prospective and retrospective observational studies (comprising together \nmore than 2,400 infants of that age class), epidemiological databases research and postmarketing \nreports suggest that the safety profile in infants less than one year of age is similar to the established \nsafety profile of children aged one year and older. \n \nOlder people and patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease \nThe population included in the influenza treatment studies is comprised of otherwise healthy \nadults/adolescents and patients \u201cat risk\u201d (patients at higher risk of developing complications associated \nwith influenza, e.g. older people and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, \nthe safety profile in the patients \u201cat risk\u201d was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy \nadults/adolescents. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \nIn a double blind study for the treatment of influenza, a total of 199 adult immunocompromised \npatients (evaluable for safety) were randomized to receive oseltamivir for 10 days: 98 patients \nreceived the standard dose (75 mg twice daily) and 101 patients received the double dose (150 mg \ntwice daily). The safety profile of oseltamivir observed in this study was consistent with that observed \nin previous clinical trials where oseltamivir was administered for treatment of influenza in non-\nimmunocompromised patients (otherwise healthy patients or \u201cat risk\u201d patients [i.e., those with \nrespiratory and/or cardiac co-morbidities]). The percentage of patients reporting adverse events was \nlower in the standard dose group compared to the double dose group (49.0% vs 59.4 %, respectively) \n(See section 5.1). \n \nIn a 12-week prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised patients, including 18 children 1 to 12 \nyears of age and older, the safety profile in the 238 patients who received oseltamivir was consistent \nwith that previously observed in oseltamivir prophylaxis clinical studies. \n \nChildren with pre-existing bronchial asthma \nIn general, the adverse reaction profile in children with pre-existing bronchial asthma was qualitatively \nsimilar to that of otherwise healthy children. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with oseltamivir have been received from clinical trials and during post-\nmarketing experience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse events were reported. \n \nAdverse events reported following overdose were similar in nature and distribution to those observed \nwith therapeutic doses of oseltamivir, described in section 4.8 Undesirable effects. \n \nNo specific antidote is known.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOverdose has been reported more frequently for children than adults and adolescents. Caution should \nbe exercised when preparing oseltamivir oral suspension and when administering oseltamivir products \nto children. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, neuraminidase inhibitors,  \nATC code: J05AH02 \n \nOseltamivir phosphate is a pro-drug of the active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate). The active \nmetabolite is a selective inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins \nfound on the virion surface. Viral neuraminidase enzyme activity is important both for viral entry into \nuninfected cells and for the release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the \nfurther spread of infectious virus in the body. \n \nOseltamivir carboxylate inhibits influenza A and B neuraminidases in vitro. Oseltamivir phosphate \ninhibits influenza virus infection and replication in vitro. Oseltamivir given orally inhibits influenza A \nand B virus replication and pathogenicity in vivo in animal models of influenza infection at antiviral \nexposures similar to that achieved in man with 75 mg twice daily. \n \nAntiviral activity of oseltamivir was supported for influenza A and B by experimental challenge \nstudies in healthy volunteers. \nNeuraminidase enzyme IC50 values for oseltamivir for clinically isolated influenza A ranged from \n0.1 nM to 1.3 nM, and for influenza B was 2.6 nM. Higher IC50 values for influenza B, up to a median \nof 8.5 nM, have been observed in published studies. \n \nClinical studies \n \nTreatment of influenza infection \n \nThe indication is based on clinical studies of naturally occurring influenza in which the predominant \ninfection was influenza A. \n \nOseltamivir is effective only against illnesses caused by influenza virus. Statistical analyses are \ntherefore presented only for influenza-infected subjects. In the pooled treatment study population, \nwhich included both influenza-positive and -negative subjects (ITT), primary efficacy was reduced \nproportionally to the number of influenza-negative individuals. In the overall treatment population, \ninfluenza infection was confirmed in 67 % (range 46 % to 74 %) of the recruited patients. Of the \nolder subjects, 64 % were influenza-positive and of those with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory \ndisease 62 % were influenza-positive. In all phase III treatment studies, patients were recruited \nonly during the period in which influenza was circulating in the local community. \n \nAdults and adolescents 13 years of age and older: Patients were eligible if they reported within 36 \nhours of onset of symptoms, had fever \u2265 37.8 \u00b0C, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom \n(cough, nasal symptoms or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, \nmalaise, fatigue or headache). In a pooled analysis of all influenza-positive adults and adolescents (N = \n2,413) enrolled into treatment studies, oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the median \nduration of influenza illness by approximately one day from 5.2 days (95 % CI 4.9 \u2013 5.5 days) in the \nplacebo group to 4.2 days (95 % CI 4.0 \u2013 4.4 days; p \u2264 0.0001). \n \nThe proportion of subjects who developed specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly \nbronchitis) treated with antibiotics was reduced from 12.7 % (135/1,063) in the placebo group to \n8.6 % (116/1,350) in the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.0012). \n \nTreatment of influenza in high risk populations: The median duration of influenza illness in older \nsubjects (\u2265 65 years) and in subjects with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease receiving \noseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days was not reduced significantly. The total duration of fever was \nreduced by one day in the groups treated with oseltamivir. In influenza-positive older people, \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\noseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of specified lower respiratory tract complications \n(mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics from 19 % (52/268) in the placebo group to 12 % (29/250) \nin the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.0156). \n \nIn influenza-positive patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease, the combined incidence \nof lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics was 17 % (22/133) \nin the placebo group and 14 % (16/118) in the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.5976). \n \nTreatment of influenza in pregnant women: No controlled clinical studies have been conducted on the \nuse of oseltamivir in pregnant women, however, there is evidence from post-marketing and \nretrospective observational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient \npopulation in terms of lower morbidity/mortality. Results from pharmacokinetic analyses indicate a \nlower exposure to the active metabolite, however dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant \nwomen in the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (see section 5.2, Pharmacokinetics, Special \nPopulation). \n \nTreatment of influenza in children: In a study of otherwise healthy children (65 % influenza-positive) \naged 1 to 12 years (mean age 5.3 years) who had fever (\u2265 37.8 \u00b0C) plus either cough or coryza, 67 % \nof influenza-positive patients were infected with influenza A and 33 % with influenza B. Oseltamivir \ntreatment, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, significantly reduced the time to freedom \nfrom illness (defined as the simultaneous return to normal health and activity and alleviation of fever, \ncough and coryza) by 1.5 days (95 % CI 0.6 \u2013 2.2 days; p < 0.0001) compared to placebo. Oseltamivir \nreduced the incidence of acute otitis media from 26.5 % (53/200) in the placebo group to 16 % \n(29/183) in the oseltamivir treated children (p = 0.013). \n \nA second study was completed in 334 asthmatic children aged 6 to 12 years old of which 53.6 % were \ninfluenza-positive. In the oseltamivir treated group, the median duration of illness was not reduced \nsignificantly. By day 6 (the last day of treatment) FEV1 had increased by 10.8 % in the oseltamivir \ntreated group compared to 4.7 % on placebo (p = 0.0148) in this population. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \noseltamivir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in influenza. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \nThe indication in infants below the age of 1 is based upon extrapolation of efficacy data from \nolder children and the recommended posology is based upon pharmacokinetic modelling data \n(see Section 5.2). \n \nTreatment of influenza B infection: Overall, 15 % of the influenza-positive population were infected by \ninfluenza B, proportions ranging from 1 to 33 % in individual studies. The median duration of illness \nin influenza B infected subjects did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in individual \nstudies. Data from 504 influenza B infected subjects were pooled across all studies for analysis. \nOseltamivir reduced the time to alleviation of all symptoms by 0.7 days (95 % CI 0.1 \u2013 1.6 days; p = \n0.022) and the duration of fever (\u2265 37.8 \u00b0C), cough and coryza by one day (95 % CI 0.4 \u2013 1.7 days; p < \n0.001) compared to placebo. \n \nTreatment of influenza in immunocompromised adults: A randomized, double blind study, to evaluate \nsafety and characterize the effects of oseltamivir on the development of resistant influenza virus \n(primary analysis) in influenza-infected adult immunocompromised patients, included 151 patients \nevaluable for efficacy of oseltamivir (secondary analysis, not powered). The study included solid \norgan transplant [SOT] patients, haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] patients, HIV positive \npatients with a CD4+ cell count <500 cells/mm3, patients on systemic immunosuppressive therapy, \nand those with haematological malignancy. These patients were randomized to be treated, within 96 \nhours of symptoms onset, with standard dose (73 patients) or double dose (78 patients) of oseltamivir, \nfor a duration of 10 days.  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nThe median time to resolution of symptoms (TTRS) was similar between the standard dose group (103 \nhours [90% CI 75.4-110.0]) and double dose group (104 hours [90% CI 65.8-131.0]). The proportion \nof patients with secondary infections in the standard dose group and double dose group was \ncomparable (8.2% vs 5.1%). \n \nPrevention of influenza \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated \nin a post-exposure prevention study in households and two seasonal prevention studies. The primary \nefficacy parameter for all of these studies was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. The \nvirulence of influenza epidemics is not predictable and varies within a region and from season to \nseason, therefore the number needed to treat (NNT) in order to prevent one case of influenza illness \nvaries. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: In a study in contacts (12.6 % vaccinated against influenza) of an index \ncase of influenza, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily was started within 2 days of onset of symptoms in the \nindex case and continued for seven days. Influenza was confirmed in 163 out of 377 index cases. \nOseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness occurring in the contacts of \nconfirmed influenza cases from 24/200 (12 %) in the placebo group to 2/205 (1 %) in the oseltamivir \ngroup (92 % reduction [95 % CI 6 \u2013 16; p \u2264 0.0001]). The number needed to treat (NNT) in contacts \nof true influenza cases was 10 (95 % CI 9 \u2013 12) and was 16 (95 % CI 15 \u2013 19) in the whole population \n(ITT) regardless of infection status in the index case. \n \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated \nin a post-exposure prevention study in households that included adults, adolescents, and children aged \n1 to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. The primary efficacy parameter for this \nstudy was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the households. Oseltamivir \nprophylaxis lasted for 10 days. In the total population, there was a reduction in the incidence of \nlaboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in households from 20 % (27 / 136) in the group not receiving \nprevention to 7 % (10 / 135) in the group receiving prevention (62.7 % reduction [95 % CI 26.0 \u2013 \n81.2; p = 0.0042]). In households of influenza-infected index cases, there was a reduction in the \nincidence of influenza from 26 % (23 / 89) in the group not receiving prevention to 11 % (9 / 84) in \nthe group receiving prevention (58.5 % reduction [95 % CI 15.6 \u2013 79.6; p = 0.0114]). According to \nsubgroup analysis in children at 1 to 12 years of age, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical \ninfluenza among children was significantly reduced from 19 % (21 / 111) in the group not receiving \nprevention to 7 % (7 / 104) in the group receiving prevention (64.4 % reduction [95 % CI 15.8 \u2013 85.0; \np = 0.0188]). Among children who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of \nlaboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was reduced from 21 % (15 / 70) in the group not receiving \nprevention to 4 % (2 / 47) in the group receiving prevention (80.1 % reduction [95 % CI 22.0 \u2013 94.9; \np = 0.0206]). The NNT for the total paediatric population was 9 (95 % CI 7 \u2013 24) and 8 (95 % CI 6, \nupper limit not estimable) in the whole population (ITT) and in paediatric contacts of infected index \ncases (ITTII), respectively. \n \nPost-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic: \nPrevention during an influenza pandemic has not been studied in controlled clinical studies in \nchildren 0-12 months of age. See Section 5.2 for exposure simulation details. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: In a pooled analysis of two other studies \nconducted in unvaccinated otherwise healthy adults, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks \nsignificantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 25 /519 (4.8 %) in the placebo \ngroup to 6/520 (1.2 %) in the oseltamivir group (76 % reduction [95 % CI 1.6 \u2013 5.7; p = 0.0006]) \nduring a community outbreak of influenza. The NNT in this study was 28 (95 % CI 24 \u2013 50). A \nstudy in older people in nursing homes, where 80 % of participants received vaccine in the season \nof the study, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of \nclinical influenza illness from 12/272 (4.4 %) in the placebo group to 1/276 (0.4 %) in the \noseltamivir group (92 % reduction [95 % CI 1.5 \u2013 6.6; p = 0.0015]). The NNT in this study was 25 \n(95 % CI 23 \u2013 62). \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \nProphylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nrandomised study was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised \npatients (388 patients with solid organ transplantation [195 placebo; 193 oseltamivir], 87 patients with \nhaemopoetic stem cell transplantation [43 placebo; 44 oseltamivir], no patient with other \nimmunosuppressant conditions), including 18 children 1 to 12 years of age. The primary endpoint in \nthis study was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza as determined by viral culture \nand/or a four-fold rise in HAI antibodies. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was \n2.9 % (7/238) in the placebo group and 2.1 % (5/237) in the oseltamivir group (95 % CI -2.3 % \u2013 \n4.1 %; p = 0.772). \n \nSpecific studies have not been conducted to assess the reduction in the risk of complications. \n \nOseltamivir resistance \nClinical studies: The risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or frank \nresistance to oseltamivir has been examined during Roche-sponsored clinical studies. Developing \noseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment was more frequent in children than adults, ranging from \nless than 1% in adults to 18% in infants aged below 1 year. Children who were found to carry \noseltamivir-resistant virus in general shed the virus for a prolonged period compared with subjects \nwith susceptible virus. However treatment-emergent resistance to oseltamivir did not affect treatment \nresponse and caused no prolongation of influenza symptoms. \n \nAn overall higher incidence of oseltamivir-resistance was observed in adult immunocompromised \npatients treated with standard dose or double dose of oseltamivir for a duration of 10 days [14.9% \n(10/67) in standard dose group and 2.8% (2/71) in double dose group], compared to data from studies \nwith oseltamivir-treated otherwise healthy adult patients. The majority of patients that developed \nresistance were transplant recipients (8/10 patients in the standard dose group and 2/2 patients in the \ndouble dose group). Most of the patients with oseltamivir-resistant virus were infected with influenza \ntype A and had prolonged viral shedding. \n \nIncidence of Oseltamivir Resistance in Clinical Studies \n \n\nPatient Population \nPatients with Resistance Mutations (%) \n\nPhenotyping* Geno- and Phenotyping* \nAdults and adolescents 0.88% (21/2377) 1.12% (27/2391) \n\nChildren (1-12 years) 3.89% (66/1698) 4.24% (72/1698) \nInfants (<1year) 18.31% (13/71) 18.31% (13/71) \n\n* Full genotyping was not performed in all studies. \n \nProphylaxis of Influenza \nThere has been no evidence for emergence of drug resistance associated with the use of oseltamivir in \nclinical studies conducted to date in post-exposure (7 days), post-exposure within household groups \n(10 days) and seasonal (42 days) prevention of influenza in immunocompetent patients. There was no \nresistance observed during a 12-week prophylaxis study in immunocompromised patients. \n \nClinical and surveillance data: Natural mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir \nin vitro have been detected in influenza A and B viruses isolated from patients without exposure to \noseltamivir. Resistant strains selected during oseltamivir treatment have been isolated from both \nimmunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients and young \nchildren are at a higher risk of developing oseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment. \n \nOseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated from oseltamivir-treated patients and oseltamivir-resistant \nlaboratory strains of influenza viruses have been found to contain mutations in N1 and N2 \nneuraminidases. Resistance mutations tend to be viral sub-type specific. Since 2007 naturally occurring \nresistance associated with the H275Y mutation in seasonal H1N1 strains has been sporadically detected. \nThe susceptibility to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such viruses appear to vary seasonally and \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\ngeographically. In 2008, H275Y was found in > 99 % of circulating H1N1 influenza isolates in Europe. \nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza (\u201cswine flu\u201d) was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir, with only \nsporadic reports of resistance in connection with both therapeutic and prophylactic regimens. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral Information \n \nAbsorption \nOseltamivir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of oseltamivir \nphosphate (pro-drug) and is extensively converted by predominantly hepatic esterases to the active \nmetabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate). At least 75 % of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation \nas the active metabolite. Exposure to the pro-drug is less than 5 % relative to the active metabolite. \nPlasma concentrations of both pro-drug and active metabolite are proportional to dose and are \nunaffected by co-administration with food. \n \nDistribution \nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state of the oseltamivir carboxylate is approximately 23 \nlitres in humans, a volume equivalent to extracellular body fluid. Since neuraminidase activity is \nextracellular, oseltamivir carboxylate distributes to all sites of influenza virus spread. \n \nThe binding of the oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is negligible (approximately 3 %). \n \nBiotransformation \nOseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases located predominantly in \nthe liver. In vitro studies demonstrated that neither oseltamivir nor the active metabolite is a substrate \nfor, or an inhibitor of, the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. No phase 2 conjugates of either \ncompound have been identified in vivo. \n \nElimination \nAbsorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90 %) eliminated by conversion to oseltamivir carboxylate. It is \nnot further metabolised and is eliminated in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of oseltamivir \ncarboxylate decline with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects. The active metabolite is \neliminated entirely by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 l/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate \n(7.5 l/h) indicating that tubular secretion occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20 % of \nan oral radiolabelled dose is eliminated in faeces. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPaediatric population \nInfants less than 1 year of age: The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of oseltamivir \nhave been evaluated in two uncontrolled open-label studies including influenza infected children less \nthan one year of age (n=135). The rate of clearance of the active metabolite, corrected for body-\nweight, decreases with ages below one year. Metabolite exposures are also more variable in the \nyoungest infants. The available data indicates that the exposure following a 3 mg/kg dose in infants 0 - \n12 months of age provides pro-drug and metabolite exposures anticipated to be efficacious with a \nsafety profile comparable to that seen in older children and adults using the approved dose (see \nsections 4.1 and 4.2). The reported adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile in \nolder children. \n \nThere are no data available for infants below 1 year of age for post exposure prevention of influenza. \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community has not been studied in children below 12 \nyears of age. \n \nPost-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic:  \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nSimulation of once daily dosing of 3mg/kg in infants <1 year shows an exposure in the same range or \nhigher than for once daily dosing of 75 mg in adults. Exposure does not exceed that for treatment of \ninfants < 1 year (3 mg/kg twice daily) and is anticipated to result in a comparable safety profile (see \nSection 4.8). No clinical studies of prophylaxis in infants aged <1 have been performed.  \n \nInfants and children 1 year of age or older: The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir have been evaluated \nin single-dose pharmacokinetic studies in infants, children and adolescents 1 to 16 years of age. \nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetics were studied in a small number of children enrolled in a clinical \nefficacy study. Younger children cleared both the pro-drug and its active metabolite faster than adults, \nresulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. Doses of 2 mg/kg give oseltamivir carboxylate \nexposures comparable to those achieved in adults receiving a single 75 mg dose (approximately 1 \nmg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in children and adolescents 12 years of age or older are \nsimilar to those in adults. \n \nElderly \nExposure to the active metabolite at steady state was 25 to 35 % higher in older people (age 65 to 78 \nyears) compared to adults less than 65 years of age given comparable doses of oseltamivir. Half-lives \nobserved in older people were similar to those seen in young adults. On the basis of drug exposure \nand tolerability, dosage adjustments are not required for older people unless there is evidence of \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 60 ml /min) (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nAdministration of 100 mg oseltamivir phosphate twice daily for 5 days to patients with various degrees \nof renal impairment showed that exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate is inversely proportional to \ndeclining renal function. For dosing, see section 4.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn vitro studies have concluded that exposure to oseltamivir is not expected to be increased \nsignificantly nor is exposure to the active metabolite expected to be significantly decreased in patients \nwith hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nPregnant Women \nA pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the Ebilfumin dosage regimen  \ndescribed in Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration results in lower exposure (30% on  \naverage across all trimesters) to the active metabolite in pregnant women compared to  \nnon-pregnant women. The lower predicted exposure however, remains above inhibitory concentrations \n(IC95 values) and at a therapeutic level for a range of  influenza virus strains. In addition, there is \nevidence from observational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient \npopulation. Therefore, dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant women in the treatment  \nor prophylaxis of influenza (see section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). \n \nImmunocompromised Patients \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that treatment of adult immunocompromised patients \nwith oseltamivir (as described in Section 4.2. Posology and method of administration) results in an \nincreased exposure (of up to 50%) to the active metabolite when compared to adult non-\nimmunocompromised patients with comparable creatinine clearance. Due to the wide safety margin of \nthe active metabolite, no dose adjustments are required in adults due to their immunocompromised \nstatus. However, for adult immunocompromised patients with renal impairment, doses should be \nadjusted as outlined in section 4.2. Posology and method of administration.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Results of the conventional rodent \ncarcinogenicity studies showed a trend towards a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of some \ntumours that are typical for the rodent strains used. Considering the margins of exposure in relation to \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nthe expected exposure in the human use, these findings do not change the benefit-risk of oseltamivir in \nits adopted therapeutic indications. \n \nTeratology studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 1,500 mg/kg/day and 500 \nmg/kg/day, respectively. No effects on foetal development were observed. A rat fertility study up to a \ndose of 1,500 mg/kg/day demonstrated no adverse reactions on either sex. In pre- and post-natal rat \nstudies, prolonged parturition was noted at 1,500 mg/kg/day: the safety margin between human \nexposure and the highest no-effect dose (500 mg/kg/day) in rats is 480-fold for oseltamivir and 44-fold \nfor the active metabolite, respectively. Foetal exposure in the rats and rabbits was approximately 15 to \n20 % of that of the mother. \n \nIn lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in the milk. Limited data indicate \nthat oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in human milk. Extrapolation of the animal data \nprovides estimates of 0.01 mg/day and 0.3 mg/day for the respective compounds. \n \nA potential for skin sensitisation to oseltamivir was observed in a \"maximisation\" test in guinea pigs. \nApproximately 50 % of the animals treated with the unformulated active substance showed erythema \nafter challenging the induced animals. Reversible irritancy of rabbits' eyes was detected. \n \nWhereas very high oral single doses of oseltamivir phosphate salt, up to the highest dose tested (1,310 \nmg/kg), had no adverse reactions in adult rats, such doses resulted in toxicity in juvenile 7-day- old rat \npups, including death. These reactions were seen at doses of 657 mg/kg and higher. At 500 mg/kg, no \nadverse reactions were seen, including upon chronic treatment (500 mg/kg/day administered from 7 to \n21 days post partum). \n \n \n6.

In both cases, \nthe correct volumes should preferably be marked on the syringes. \n \nPharmacy compounding \n \nPharmacy compounded 6 mg/ml suspension prepared from capsules \n \nAdults, adolescents and infants and children 1 year of age or older who are unable to swallow intact \ncapsules \nThis procedure describes the preparation of a 6 mg/ml suspension that will provide one patient with \nenough medicine for a 5-day course of treatment or a 10-day course of prophylaxis. \n \nThe pharmacist may compound a 6 mg/ml suspension from Ebilfumin 30 mg, 45 mg or 75 mg \ncapsules using water containing 0.05 % w/v sodium benzoate added as a preservative. \n \nFirst, calculate the total volume needed to be compounded and dispensed to provide a 5-day course of \ntreatment or a 10-day course of prophylaxis for the patient. The total volume required is determined by \nthe weight of the patient according to the recommendation in the table below. To allow for accurate \nvolume withdrawal of up to 10 doses (2 withdrawals per daily treatment dose for 5 days), the column \nindicating measurement loss is to be considered for compounding. \n \nVolume of pharmacy compounded 6 mg/ml suspension prepared based upon the patient\u2019s \nweight \n\nBody weight \n(kg) \n\nTotal volume to compound  \nper patient weight \n\n(ml) \nMeasurement loss not considered \n\nTotal volume to compound  \nper patient weight \n\n(ml) \nMeasurement loss considered \n\n10 kg to 15 kg 50 ml 60 ml or 75 ml* \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 75 ml 90 ml or 100 ml* \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 100 ml 125 ml \n\n> 40 kg 125 ml 137.5 ml (or 150 ml)* \n* Depending on the capsule strength used. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \nSecond, determine the number of capsules and the amount of vehicle (water containing 0.05 % w/v \nsodium benzoate added as a preservative) that is needed to prepare the total volume (calculated from \nthe table above) of pharmacy compounded 6 mg/ml suspension as shown in the table below: \n \nNumber of capsules and amount of vehicle needed to prepare the total volume of a pharmacy \ncompounded 6 mg/ml suspension \n\nTotal volume \nof compounded \n\nsuspension \nto be prepared \n\nRequired number of Ebilfumin capsules \n(mg of oseltamivir) \n\nRequired volume \nof vehicle 75 mg 45 mg 30 mg \n\n60 ml Please use \nalternative \n\ncapsule \nstrength* \n\n8 capsules \n(360 mg) \n\n12 capsules \n(360 mg) \n\n59.5 ml \n\n75 ml 6 capsules \n(450 mg) \n\n10 capsules \n(450 mg) \n\n15 capsules \n(450 mg) \n\n74 ml \n\n90 ml Please use \nalternative \n\ncapsule \nstrength* \n\n12 capsules \n(540 mg) \n\n18 capsules \n(540 mg) \n\n89 ml \n\n100 ml 8 capsules \n(600 mg) \n\nPlease use \nalternative \n\ncapsule \nstrength* \n\n20 capsules \n(600 mg) \n\n98.5 ml \n\n125 ml 10 capsules \n(750 mg) \n\nPlease use \nalternative \n\ncapsule \nstrength* \n\n \n25 capsules \n(750 mg) \n\n123.5 ml \n\n137.5 ml 11 capsules \n(825 mg) \n\nPlease use \nalternative \n\ncapsule \nstrength* \n\nPlease use \nalternative \n\ncapsule \nstrength* \n\n136 ml \n\n* There is no combination of this capsule strength that can be used to achieve the target concentration; \ntherefore, please use an alternative capsule strength. \n \nThird, follow the procedure below for compounding the 6 mg/ml suspension from Ebilfumin capsules: \n1.

What Ebilfumin is and what it is used for \n \n\u2022 Ebilfumin is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn \n\nbabies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2022 Ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of \nage for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu. \n\n\u2022 Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nEbilfumin contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase \ninhibitors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease \nor prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs \nduring annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside \nepidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ebilfumin  \n \nDo not take Ebilfumin: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Ebilfumin. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ebilfumin. \nBefore you take Ebilfumin, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2022 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2022 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2022 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2022 if your immune system is not working \n\u2022 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Ebilfumin, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2022 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents. These may be signs of rare but serious side effects. \n \nEbilfumin is not a flu vaccine \nEbilfumin is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Ebilfumin will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you \nmight be prescribed both by your doctor. \n \nOther medicines and Ebilfumin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are \nparticularly important: \n\u2022 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2022 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2022 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2022 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nso that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEbilfumin has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nEbilfumin contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Ebilfumin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nTake Ebilfumin as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \nThe recommended doses \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n \nFor adult patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \nIn special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment \nwill continue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight. You must use the amount of \noral capsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor. \n \nAdults and adolescents 13 years and over \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose for 5 days \nPreventing flu: \ndose for 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 75 mg twice daily 75 mg once daily \n75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose for 5 days \nPreventing flu: \ndose for 10 days \n\n10 to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg once daily \nMore than 15 kg and up to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily 45 mg once daily \nMore than 23 kg and up to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily 60 mg once daily \nMore than 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg once daily \n\n75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Ebilfumin to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during a flu pandemic should be \nbased upon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk \nto the infant. \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days  \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n3 kg to 10+ kg 3 mg per kg body  \nweight, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg,  \nonce daily \n\nmg per kg = mg for each kilogram of the infant\u2019s body weight. For example: \nIf a 6-month-old weighs 8 kg, the dose is \n8 kg x 3mg per kg = 24 mg \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. \n \nEbilfumin can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance \nof feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \n \nPeople who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid form of this medicine (oral \nsuspension). If you need an oral suspension but it\u2019s not available from your pharmacy, you can \nmake a liquid form of Ebilfumin from these capsules. See Making Liquid Ebilfumin at home for \ninstructions. \n \nIf you take more Ebilfumin than you should \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nStop taking Ebilfumin and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when oseltamivir was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Ebilfumin for \nchildren and when administering Ebilfumin capsules or liquid Ebilfumin to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Ebilfumin \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Ebilfumin \nThere are no side effects when you stop Ebilfumin. But if Ebilfumin is stopped earlier than your \ndoctor told you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your \ndoctor prescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\u2022 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \n\nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of the \n\nskin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\u2022 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \n\nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\u2022 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life- \n\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, initially \nwith fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding of larger \nareas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2022 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Ebilfumin are feeling or \nbeing sick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain.

This pharmacy preparation is \nthe preferred option. \n \nIf the pharmacy preparation is not available either, you can make Ebilfumin suspension from these \ncapsules at home. \n \nThe dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. \n \nMaking Liquid Ebilfumin at home \n \n\u2022 If you have the right capsule for the dose needed (a 30 mg or a 60 mg dose), you will open the \n\ncapsule and stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. \nThis is usually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. \n\n \n\u2022 If you need smaller doses, making Ebilfumin suspension from capsules involves extra steps. \n\nThis is suitable for younger children and babies: they usually need an Ebilfumin dose of less \nthan 30 mg. See the lower set of instructions. \n\n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \n \nTo make a 30 mg or a 60 mg dose, \nyou need: \n\n\u2022  One or two 30 mg Ebilfumin capsule(s) \n\u2022  Sharp scissors \n\u2022  One small bowl \n\u2022  Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2022  Water \n\u2022  Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. \n\n Examples are: chocolate or cherry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Check the dose is correct \n \n\nTo find the correct amount to use, find the patient\u2019s weight on the left of the table. \nLook at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a \nsingle dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. \n \nYou should use only 30 mg capsules for 30 mg and 60 mg doses. Do not try to make a 45 mg or \n75 mg dose by using the contents of 30 mg capsules. Use the appropriate size capsule instead.  \n\n \nWeight Dose of Ebilfumin Number of capsules \nUp to 15 kg 30 mg 1 capsule \n15 kg up to 23 kg 45 mg Do not use 30 mg capsules \n23 kg up to 40 kg 60 mg 2 capsules \n\n \nStep 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nHold a 30 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors.   \nPour all of the powder into the bowl. \nOpen a second capsule for a 60 mg dose. Pour all of the powder into the bowl.   \nBe careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n \n\n   \n \nStep 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of sweet food to the powder in the bowl.  \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin powder. \nStir the mixture well. \n \n\n \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away.  \n \nIf there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get \nthe patient to drink it all. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year  \n \nTo make a smaller single dose, you need: \n\n\u2022  One 30 mg Ebilfumin capsule \n\u2022  Sharp scissors \n\u2022  Two small bowls (use separate pairs of bowls for each child) \n\u2022  One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water \u2013 a 5 or 10 ml dispenser \n\u2022  One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose \n\u2022  Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2022  Water \n\u2022  Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin. \n\nExamples are: chocolate or cherry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce.  \nOr you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \nHold a 30 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with \nscissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. \nPour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. \nThe amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 2: Add water to dilute the medicine \n \n\nUse the larger dispenser \nto draw up 5 ml water. \n \nAdd the water to the \npowder in the bowl. \n\n \n \n\nStir the mixture with \nthe teaspoon for \nabout 2 minutes. \n\n \n \n\nDon\u2019t worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive \ningredients. \n\n \nStep 3: Choose the correct amount for your child\u2019s weight \n \n\nLook up the child\u2019s weight on the left side of the table.  \nThe column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to \ndraw up.  \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies)  \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml \n5 kg 2.5 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml \n6 kg 3.0 ml \n6.5 kg 3.3 ml \n7 kg 3.5 ml \n7.5 kg 3.8 ml \n8 kg 4.0 ml \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n8.5 kg 4.3 ml \n9 kg 4.5 ml \n9.5 kg 4.8 ml \n10 kg or more 5.0 ml \n\n \nStep 4: Draw up the liquid mixture \n \n\nMake sure you have the right size dispenser.  \nDraw up the correct amount of liquid mixture from the first bowl.  \nDraw it up carefully so as not to include air bubbles. \nGently squirt the correct dose into the second bowl. \n \n\n   \n \n\nStep 5: Sweeten and give to the child \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of a sweet food to the second bowl. \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin. \nMix the sweet food and Ebilfumin suspension well. \n \n\n   \n \nGive the whole contents of the second bowl (Ebilfumin suspension with sweet food added) to \nthe child straight away. \n \nIf there is anything left in the second bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and \nget the child to drink it all. For children unable to drink from a bowl, spoon-feed or use a bottle \nto feed the child the remaining liquid. \n \nGive the child something to drink. \n \nThrow away any unused liquid left in the first bowl. \n\n \n Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n \n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInformation for healthcare professionals only \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules: \nCommercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product \nfor paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded. In the event that oseltamivir powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may \ncompound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Ebilfumin capsules. If the pharmacy compounded suspension \nis also not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. \n \nOral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for \nadministering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home \npreparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers. For \nhome preparation, separate dispensers should be provided for taking the correct volume of water and \nfor measuring the Ebilfumin-water mixture. For measuring 5.0 ml of water, dispensers of 5 ml or \n10 ml should be used. \n \nThe appropriate dispenser sizes for taking the correct volume of Ebilfumin suspension (6 mg/ml) are \nshown below. \n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies):  \n\nDose of Ebilfumin \nAmount of Ebilfumin \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n9 mg 1.5 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n\n10 mg 1.7 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n11.25 mg 1.9 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n12.5 mg 2.1 ml 3.0 ml \n13.75 mg 2.3 ml 3.0 ml \n\n15 mg 2.5 ml 3.0 ml \n16.25 mg 2.7 ml 3.0 ml \n\n18 mg 3.0 ml 3.0 ml (or 5.0 ml) \n19.5 mg 3.3 ml 5.0 ml \n21 mg 3.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n22.5 mg 3.8 ml 5.0 ml \n24 mg 4.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n25.5 mg 4.3 ml 5.0 ml \n27 mg 4.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n28.5 mg 4.8 ml 5.0 ml \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nEbilfumin 45 mg hard capsules \noseltamivir \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What Ebilfumin is and what it is used for \n \n\u2022 Ebilfumin is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn \n\nbabies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2022 Ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of \nage for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu. \n\n\u2022 Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nEbilfumin contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase \ninhibitors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease \nor prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs \nduring annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside \nepidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ebilfumin  \n \nDo not take Ebilfumin: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Ebilfumin. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ebilfumin. \nBefore you take Ebilfumin, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2022 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2022 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2022 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2022 if your immune system is not working \n\u2022 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Ebilfumin, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2022 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents. These may be signs of rare but serious side effects. \n \nEbilfumin is not a flu vaccine \nEbilfumin is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Ebilfumin will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you \nmight be prescribed both by your doctor. \n \nOther medicines and Ebilfumin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are \nparticularly important: \n\u2022 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2022 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2022 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2022 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nso that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEbilfumin has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nEbilfumin contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Ebilfumin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nTake Ebilfumin as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \nThe recommended doses \n \nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \nFor adult patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \nIn special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment \nwill continue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight. You must use the amount of \noral capsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor. \n \nAdults and adolescents 13 years and over \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose for 5 days \nPreventing flu: \ndose for 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 75 mg twice daily 75 mg once daily \n75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose for 5 days \nPreventing flu: \ndose for 10 days \n\n10 to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg once daily \nMore than 15 kg and up to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily 45 mg once daily \nMore than 23 kg and up to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily 60 mg once daily \nMore than 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg once daily \n\n75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Ebilfumin to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during a flu pandemic should be \nbased upon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk \nto the infant. \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days  \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n3 kg to 10+ kg \n \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg,  \nonce daily \n\nmg per kg = mg for each kilogram of the infant\u2019s body weight. For example: \nIf a 6-month-old weighs 8 kg, the dose is \n8 kg x 3mg per kg = 24 mg \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. \n \nEbilfumin can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance \nof feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \n \nPeople who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid form of this medicine (oral \nsuspension). If you need an oral suspension but it\u2019s not available from your pharmacy, you can \nmake a liquid form of Ebilfumin from these capsules. See Making Liquid Ebilfumin at home for \ninstructions. \n \nIf you take more Ebilfumin than you should \nStop taking Ebilfumin and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when oseltamivir was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Ebilfumin for \nchildren and when administering Ebilfumin capsules or liquid Ebilfumin to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Ebilfumin \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Ebilfumin \nThere are no side effects when you stop Ebilfumin. But if Ebilfumin is stopped earlier than your \ndoctor told you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your \ndoctor prescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\u2022 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \n\nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of the \n\nskin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\u2022 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \n\nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\u2022 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life- \n\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, initially \nwith fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding of larger \nareas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2022 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Ebilfumin are feeling or \nbeing sick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain. These side effects \nmostly occur after the first dose of the medicine and will usually stop as treatment continues. The \nfrequency of these effects is reduced if the medicinal product is taken with food. \n \nRare but serious effects: get medical help at once \n(These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \nDuring oseltamivir treatment, rare events have been reported that include \n\u2022 Convulsions and delirium, including altered level of consciousness \n\u2022 Confusion, abnormal behaviour \n\u2022 Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares \nThese are reported primarily among children and adolescents and often started suddenly and resolved \nrapidly.

This pharmacy preparation is \nthe preferred option. \n \nIf the pharmacy preparation is not available either, you can make Ebilfumin suspension from these \ncapsules at home. \n \nThe dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. \n \nMaking Liquid Ebilfumin at home \n \n\u2022 If you have the right capsule for the dose needed (a 45 mg dose), you will open the capsule \n\nand stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. This is \nusually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. \n\n \n\u2022 If you need smaller doses, making Ebilfumin suspension from capsules involves extra steps. \n\nThis is suitable for younger, lighter children and babies: they usually need an Ebilfumin dose of \nless than 45 mg. See the lower set of instructions. \n\n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \n \nTo make a 45 mg dose, \nyou need: \n\n\u2022  One 45 mg Ebilfumin capsule \n\u2022  Sharp scissors \n\u2022  One small bowl \n\u2022  Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2022  Water \n\u2022  Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. \n\n Examples are: chocolate or cherry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Check the dose is correct \n \n\nTo find the correct amount to use, find the patient\u2019s weight on the left of the table. \nLook at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a \nsingle dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. \n \nYou should use only 45 mg capsules for 45 mg doses. Do not try to make a 30 mg, 60 mg or \n75 mg dose by using the contents of 45 mg capsules. Use the appropriate size capsule instead.  \n\n \nWeight Dose of Ebilfumin Number of capsules \nUp to 15 kg 30 mg Do not use 45 mg capsules \n15 kg up to 23 kg 45 mg 1 capsule \n23 kg up to 40 kg 60 mg Do not use 45 mg capsules \n\n \nStep 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\nHold a 45 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors.   \nPour all of the powder into the bowl.   \nBe careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n \n\n \n \nStep 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of sweet food to the powder in the bowl.  \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin powder. \nStir the mixture well. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away.  \n \nIf there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get \nthe patient to drink it all. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year  \n \nTo make a smaller single dose, you need: \n\n\u2022  One 45 mg Ebilfumin capsule \n\u2022  Sharp scissors \n\u2022  Two small bowls (use separate pairs of bowls for each child) \n\u2022  One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water \u2013 a 5 ml dispenser or 10 ml dispenser \n\u2022  One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose \n\u2022  Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2022  Water \n\u2022  Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin. \n\nExamples are: chocolate or cherry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce.  \nOr you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nHold a 45 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with \nscissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. \nPour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. \nThe amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. \n \n\n \n \nStep 2: Add water to dilute the medicine \n \n\nUse the larger dispenser \nto draw up 7.5 ml water. \n \nAdd the water to the \npowder in the bowl. \n\n \n \n\nStir the mixture with \nthe teaspoon for \nabout 2 minutes. \n\n \n \n\nDon\u2019t worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive \ningredients. \n\n \nStep 3: Choose the correct amount for your child\u2019s weight \n \n\nLook up the child\u2019s weight on the left side of the table.  \nThe column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to \ndraw up.  \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies) \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml \n5 kg 2.5 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml \n6 kg 3.0 ml \n6.5 kg 3.3 ml \n7 kg 3.5 ml \n7.5 kg 3.8 ml \n8 kg 4.0 ml \n8.5 kg 4.3 ml \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n9 kg 4.5 ml \n9.5 kg 4.8 ml \n10 kg or more 5.0 ml \n\n \nStep 4: Draw up the liquid mixture \n \n\nMake sure you have the right size dispenser.  \nDraw up the correct amount of liquid mixture from the first bowl.  \nDraw it up carefully so as not to include air bubbles. \nGently squirt the correct dose into the second bowl. \n \n\n   \n \n\nStep 5: Sweeten and give to the child \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of a sweet food to the second bowl. \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin. \nMix the sweet food and Ebilfumin suspension well. \n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the second bowl (Ebilfumin suspension with sweet food added) to \nthe child straight away. \n \nIf there is anything left in the second bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and \nget the child to drink it all. For children unable to drink from a bowl, spoon-feed or use a bottle \nto feed the child the remaining liquid. \n \nGive the child something to drink. \n \nThrow away any unused liquid left in the first bowl. \n\n \n Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInformation for healthcare professionals only \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules:   \nCommercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product \nfor paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded. In the event that oseltamivir powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may \ncompound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Ebilfumin capsules. If the pharmacy compounded suspension \nis also not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. \n \nOral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for \nadministering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home \npreparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers. For \nhome preparation, separate dispensers should be provided for taking the correct volume of water and \nfor measuring the Ebilfumin-water mixture. For measuring 5.0 ml of water, dispensers of 5 ml or \n10 ml should be used. \n \nThe appropriate dispenser sizes for taking the correct volume of Ebilfumin suspension (6 mg/ml) are \nshown below. \n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies):  \n\nDose of Ebilfumin \nAmount of Ebilfumin \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n9 mg 1.5 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n\n10 mg 1.7 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n11.25 mg 1.9 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n12.5 mg 2.1 ml 3.0 ml \n13.75 mg 2.3 ml 3.0 ml \n\n15 mg 2.5 ml 3.0 ml \n16.25 mg 2.7 ml 3.0 ml \n\n18 mg 3.0 ml 3.0 ml (or 5.0 ml) \n19.5 mg 3.3 ml 5.0 ml \n21 mg 3.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n22.5 mg 3.8 ml 5.0 ml \n24 mg 4.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n25.5 mg 4.3 ml 5.0 ml \n27 mg 4.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n28.5 mg 4.8 ml 5.0 ml \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nEbilfumin 75 mg hard capsules \noseltamivir \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What Ebilfumin is and what it is used for \n \n\u2022 Ebilfumin is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn \n\nbabies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2022 Ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of \nage for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu. \n\n\u2022 Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nEbilfumin contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase \ninhibitors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease \nor prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs \nduring annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside \nepidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ebilfumin  \n \nDo not take Ebilfumin: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Ebilfumin. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ebilfumin. \nBefore you take Ebilfumin, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2022 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2022 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2022 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2022 if your immune system is not working \n\u2022 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Ebilfumin, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2022 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents. These may be signs of rare but serious side effects. \n \nEbilfumin is not a flu vaccine \nEbilfumin is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Ebilfumin will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you \nmight be prescribed both by your doctor. \n \nOther medicines and Ebilfumin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are \nparticularly important: \n\u2022 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2022 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2022 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2022 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nso that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEbilfumin has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nEbilfumin contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Ebilfumin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nTake Ebilfumin as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \nThe recommended doses \n \nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \nFor adult patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \nIn special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment \nwill continue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight. You must use the amount of \noral capsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor. \n \nAdults and adolescents 13 years and over \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose for 5 days \nPreventing flu: \ndose for 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 75 mg twice daily 75 mg once daily \n75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose for 5 days \nPreventing flu: \ndose for 10 days \n\n10 to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg once daily \nMore than 15 kg and up to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily 45 mg once daily \nMore than 23 kg and up to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily 60 mg once daily \nMore than 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg once daily \n\n75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Ebilfumin to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during a flu pandemic should be \nbased upon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk \nto the infant.  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days  \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n3 kg to 10+ kg \n \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg,  \nonce daily \n\nmg per kg = mg for each kilogram of the infant\u2019s body weight. For example: \nIf a 6-month-old weighs 8 kg, the dose is \n8 kg x 3mg per kg = 24 mg \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. \n \nEbilfumin can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance \nof feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \n \nPeople who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid form of this medicine (oral \nsuspension). If you need an oral suspension but it\u2019s not available from your pharmacy, you can \nmake a liquid form of Ebilfumin from these capsules. See Making Liquid Ebilfumin at home for \ninstructions. \n \nIf you take more Ebilfumin than you should \nStop taking Ebilfumin and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when oseltamivir was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Ebilfumin for \nchildren and when administering Ebilfumin capsules or liquid Ebilfumin to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Ebilfumin \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Ebilfumin \nThere are no side effects when you stop Ebilfumin. But if Ebilfumin is stopped earlier than your \ndoctor told you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your \ndoctor prescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\u2022 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \n\nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of the \n\nskin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\u2022 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \n\nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\u2022 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life- \n\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, initially \nwith fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding of larger \nareas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2022 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Ebilfumin are feeling or \nbeing sick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain. These side effects \nmostly occur after the first dose of the medicine and will usually stop as treatment continues.

This pharmacy preparation is \nthe preferred option. \n \nIf the pharmacy preparation is not available either, you can make Ebilfumin suspension from these \ncapsules at home. \n \nThe dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. \n \nMaking Liquid Ebilfumin at home \n \n\u2022 If you have the right capsule strength for the dose needed (a 75 mg dose), you will open the \n\ncapsule and stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. \nThis is usually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. \n\n \n\u2022 If you need smaller doses, making Ebilfumin suspension from capsules involves extra steps. \n\nThis is suitable for younger children and babies: they usually need an Ebilfumin dose of less \nthan 30 mg. See the lower set of instructions. \n\n \nAdults, adolescents 13 years and over,  \nand children weighing 40 kg and over \n \nTo make a 75 mg dose, \nyou need: \n\n\u2022  One 75 mg Ebilfumin capsule \n\u2022  Sharp scissors \n\u2022  One small bowl \n\u2022  Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2022  Water \n\u2022  Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. \n\n Examples are: chocolate or cherry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Check the dose is correct \n \n\nTo find the correct amount to use, find the patient\u2019s weight on the left of the table. \nLook at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a \nsingle dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. \n \nYou should use only 75 mg capsules for 75 mg doses. Do not try to make a 75 mg dose by using \nthe contents of 30 mg or 45 mg capsules. \n\n \nWeight \n \n\nDose of Ebilfumin Number of capsules \n\n40 kg and over 75 mg 1 capsule \n \n\nNot for children who weigh less than 40 kg \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nYou will need to prepare a dose of less than 75 mg for children who weigh less than 40 kg. See \nbelow.   \n\n \nStep 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\nHold a 75 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors.   \nPour all of the powder into the bowl. \nBe careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n \n\n  \n \nStep 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of sweet food to the powder in the bowl.  \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin powder. \nStir the mixture well. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away.  \n \nIf there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get \nthe patient to drink it all. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year, and children weighing less than 40 kg  \n \nTo make a smaller single dose, you need: \n\n\u2022  One 75 mg Ebilfumin capsule \n\u2022  Sharp scissors \n\u2022  Two small bowls \n\u2022  One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water \u2013 a 5 or 10 ml dispenser \n\u2022  One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose \n\u2022  Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2022  Water \n\u2022  Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin. \n\nExamples are: chocolate or cherry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce.  \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\nOr you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n\n \nHold a 75 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with \nscissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. \nPour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. \nThe amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 2: Add water to dilute the medicine \n \n\nUse the larger dispenser \nto draw up 12.5 ml water. \n \nAdd the water to the \npowder in the bowl. \n\n \n \n\nStir the mixture with \nthe teaspoon for \nabout 2 minutes. \n\n \n \n\nDon\u2019t worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive \ningredients. \n\n \nStep 3: Choose the correct amount for your child\u2019s weight \n \n\nLook up the child\u2019s weight on the left side of the table.  \nThe column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to \ndraw up.  \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies) \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml \n5 kg 2.5 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml \n6 kg 3.0 ml \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n6.5 kg 3.3 ml \n7 kg 3.5 ml \n7.5 kg 3.8 ml \n8 kg 4.0 ml \n8.5 kg 4.3 ml \n9 kg 4.5 ml \n9.5 kg 4.8 ml \n10 kg or more 5.0 ml \n\n \nChildren 1 year or older, weighing less than 40 kg \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\nUp to 15 kg 5.0 ml \n15 to 23 kg 7.5 ml \n23 to 40 kg 10.0 ml \n\n \nStep 4: Draw up the liquid mixture \n \n\nMake sure you have the right size dispenser.  \nDraw up the correct amount of liquid mixture from the first bowl.  \nDraw it up carefully so as not to include air bubbles. \nGently squirt the correct dose into the second bowl. \n \n\n \n\n \nStep 5: Sweeten and give to the child \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of a sweet food to the second bowl. \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Ebilfumin. \nMix the sweet food and Ebilfumin suspension well. \n \n\n   \n \nGive the whole contents of the second bowl (Ebilfumin suspension with sweet food added) to \nthe child straight away. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nIf there is anything left in the second bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and \nget the child to drink it all. For children unable to drink from a bowl, spoon-feed or use a bottle \nto feed the child the remaining liquid. \n \nGive the child something to drink. \n \nThrow away any unused liquid left in the first bowl. \n\n \n Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInformation for healthcare professionals only \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules:   \nCommercially manufactured oseltamivir powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product \nfor paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded. In the event that oseltamivir powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may \ncompound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Ebilfumin capsules. If the pharmacy compounded suspension \nis also not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. \n \nOral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for \nadministering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home \npreparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers. For \nhome preparation, separate dispensers should be provided for taking the correct volume of water and \nfor measuring the Ebilfumin-water mixture. For measuring 12.5 ml of water, a 10 ml dispenser should \nbe used. \n \nThe appropriate dispenser sizes for taking the correct volume of Ebilfumin suspension (6 mg/ml) are \nshown below. \n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies):  \n\nDose of Ebilfumin \nAmount of Ebilfumin \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n9 mg 1.5 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n\n10 mg 1.7 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n11.25 mg 1.9 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n12.5 mg 2.1 ml 3.0 ml \n13.75 mg 2.3 ml 3.0 ml \n\n15 mg 2.5 ml 3.0 ml \n16.25 mg 2.7 ml 3.0 ml \n\n18 mg 3.0 ml 3.0 ml (or 5.0 ml) \n19.5 mg 3.3 ml 5.0 ml \n21 mg 3.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n22.5 mg 3.8 ml 5.0 ml \n24 mg 4.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n25.5 mg 4.3 ml 5.0 ml \n27 mg 4.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n28.5 mg 4.8 ml 5.0 ml \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n \nChildren 1 year or older, weighing less than 40 kg: \n\nDose of Ebilfumin \nAmount of Ebilfumin \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml (or 10.0 ml) \n45 mg 7.5 ml 10.0 ml \n60 mg 10.0 ml  10.0 ml \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

newborn babies) for treating flu (influenza). it can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu virus is known to be going round in your community. ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis for instance, if you have been in contact with someone who has flu. ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances for example, if there is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide sufficient protection. ebilfumin contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. these medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. they help to ease or prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. the signs of flu often include a sudden fever (more than 37.8 ), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme tiredness. these symptoms can also be caused by other infections. true influenza infection only occurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. outside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness.",

adult patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. for preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. it is best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. in special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. the recommended dose is based on the patient's body weight. you must use the amount of oral capsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor. adults and adolescents 13 years and over body weight treating flu: dose for 5 days

infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during a flu pandemic should be based upon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk to the infant.

ebilfumin can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance of feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). people who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid form of this medicine (oral suspension). if you need an oral suspension but it's not available from your pharmacy, you can make a liquid form of ebilfumin from these capsules. see making liquid ebilfumin at home for instructions. if you take more ebilfumin than you should 44 stop taking ebilfumin and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. in most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. when side effects were reported, they were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. overdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when oseltamivir was given to children than to adults and adolescents. caution should be exercised when preparing liquid ebilfumin for children and when administering ebilfumin capsules or liquid ebilfumin to children. if you forget to take ebilfumin do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. if you stop taking ebilfumin there are no side effects when you stop ebilfumin. but if
