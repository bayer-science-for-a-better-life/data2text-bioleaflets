This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBretaris Genuair 322 micrograms inhalation powder\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece) contains 375 \u00b5g aclidinium bromide equivalent \nto 322 \u00b5g of aclidinium. This corresponds to a metered dose of 400 \u00b5g aclidinium bromide equivalent \nto 343 \u00b5g aclidinium.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach delivered dose contains approximately 12 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nInhalation powder.\n\nWhite or almost white powder in a white inhaler with an integral dose indicator and a green dosage \nbutton.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBretaris Genuair is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult \npatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is one inhalation of 322 micrograms aclidinium twice daily.\n\nIf a dose is missed the next dose should be taken as soon as possible. However, if it is nearly time for \nthe next dose, the missed dose should be skipped.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustments are required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustments are required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Bretaris Genuair in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) for the \nindication of COPD.\n\n\n\n3\n\nMethod of administration\nFor inhalation use.\n\nPatients should be instructed on how to administer the product correctly as the Genuair inhaler may \nwork differently from inhalers the patients may have used previously. It is important to instruct the \npatients to carefully read the Instructions for Use in the Package Leaflet, which is packed together \nwith each inhaler.\nFor Instructions for Use, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or to the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nParadoxical bronchospasm:\nAdministration of Bretaris Genuair may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, treatment \nwith Bretaris Genuair should be stopped and other treatments considered.\n\nDeterioration of disease:\nAclidinium bromide is a maintenance bronchodilator and should not be used for the relief of acute \nepisodes of bronchospasm, i.e. as a rescue therapy. In the event of a change in COPD intensity while \nthe patient is being treated with aclidinium bromide so that the patient considers additional rescue \nmedication is required, a re-evaluation of the patient and the patients\u2019 treatment regimen should be \nconducted.\n\nCardiovascular effects:\nBretaris Genuair should be used with caution in patients who had a myocardial infarction during the \nprevious 6 months, unstable angina, newly diagnosed arrhythmia within the previous 3 months, or \nhospitalisation within the previous 12 months for heart failure functional classes III and IV as per the \n\u201cNew York Heart Association\u201d. Experience in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities in clinical \ntrials is limited (see section 5.1). These conditions may be affected by the anticholinergic mechanism \nof action.\n\nAnticholinergic activity:\nDry mouth, which has been observed with anticholinergic treatment, may in the long term be \nassociated with dental caries.\n\nConsistent with its anticholinergic activity, aclidinium bromide should be used with caution in patients \nwith symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction or with narrow-angle glaucoma \n(even though direct contact of the product with the eyes is very unlikely).\n\nExcipients:\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCo-administration of aclidinium bromide with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products has \nnot been studied and is not recommended.\n\nAlthough no formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed, inhaled aclidinium bromide \nhas been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including sympathomimetic \nbronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids without clinical evidence of drug \ninteractions.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that aclidinium bromide or the metabolites of aclidinium bromide at the \ntherapeutic dose are not expected to cause interactions with active substances that are substrates of P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) or active substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and \nesterases (see section 5.2).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data available on the use of aclidinium bromide in pregnant women.\n\nStudies in animals have shown foetotoxicity only at dose levels much higher than the maximum \nhuman exposure to aclidinium bromide (see section 5.3). Aclidinium bromide should only be used \nduring pregnancy if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether aclidinium bromide / metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal studies \nhave shown excretion of small amounts of aclidinium bromide and/or metabolites into milk. A risk to \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from Bretaris Genuair therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-\nfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nStudies in rats have shown slight reductions in fertility only at dose levels much higher than the \nmaximum human exposure to aclidinium bromide (see section 5.3). It is considered unlikely that \naclidinium bromide administered at the recommended dose will affect fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAclidinium bromide may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The \noccurrence of headache, dizziness or blurred vision following administration of aclidinium bromide \n(see section 4.8) may influence the ability to drive or to use machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Bretaris Genuair were headache (6.6%) and \nnasopharyngitis (5.5%).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe frequencies assigned to the undesirable effects listed below are based on crude incidence rates of \nadverse reactions (i.e. events attributed to Bretaris Genuair) observed with Bretaris Genuair 322 \u00b5g \n(636 patients) in the pooled analysis of one 6-month and two 3-month randomised, placebo-controlled \nclinical trials.\n\nA placebo-controlled trial in 1791 patients with moderate to very severe COPD treated with Bretaris \nGenuair up to 36 months did not identify other adverse reactions. \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem organ class Preferred term Frequency\nInfections and infestations Sinusitis Common\n\nNasopharyngitis Common\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Rare\n\nAngioedema Not known\n\n\n\n5\n\nAnaphylactic reaction Not known\nNervous system disorders Headache Common\n\nDizziness Uncommon\nEye disorders Blurred vision Uncommon\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia Uncommon\n\nPalpitations Uncommon\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCough Common\nDysphonia Uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common\nNausea Common\n\nDry mouth Uncommon\nStomatitis Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash Uncommon\nPruritus Uncommon\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention Uncommon\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHigh doses of aclidinium bromide may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms.\nHowever, single inhaled doses up to 6,000 \u00b5g aclidinium bromide have been administered to healthy \nsubjects without systemic anticholinergic adverse reactions. Additionally, no clinically relevant \nadverse reactions were observed following 7-day twice daily dosing of up to 800 \u00b5g aclidinium \nbromide in healthy subjects.\n\nAcute intoxication by inadvertent medicinal product ingestion of aclidinium bromide is unlikely due to \nits low oral bioavailability and the breath-actuated dosing mechanism of the Genuair inhaler.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, anticholinergics; ATC Code: \nR03BB05.\n\nMechanism of action\nAclidinium bromide is a competitive, selective muscarinic receptor antagonist (also known as an \nanticholinergic), with a longer residence time at the M3 receptors than the M2 receptors. M3 receptors \nmediate contraction of airway smooth muscle. Inhaled aclidinium bromide acts locally in the lungs to \nantagonise M3 receptors of airway smooth muscle and induce bronchodilation. Nonclinical in vitro and \nin vivo studies showed rapid, dose-dependent and long-lasting inhibition by aclidinium of \nacetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Aclidinium bromide is quickly broken down in plasma, the \nlevel of systemic anticholinergic side effects is therefore low.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nClinical efficacy studies showed that Bretaris Genuair  provided clinically meaningful improvements \nin lung function (as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) over 12 hours\nfollowing morning and evening administration, which were evident within 30 minutes of the first dose \n(increases from baseline of 124-133 mL). Maximal bronchodilation was achieved within 1-3 hours \nafter dosing with mean peak improvements in FEV1 relative to baseline of 227-268 mL at steady-state.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc?_sm_au_=iWHNfPk6pL272dJN\n\n\n6\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\nNo effects on QT interval (corrected using either the Fridericia or Bazett method or individually-\ncorrected) were observed when aclidinium bromide (200 \u00b5g or 800 \u00b5g) was administered once daily \nfor 3 days to healthy subjects in a thorough QT study.\n\nIn addition, no clinically significant effects of Bretaris Genuair on cardiac rhythm were observed on \n24-hour Holter monitoring after 3 months treatment of 336 patients (of whom 164 received Bretaris\nGenuair 322 \u00b5g twice daily).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe Bretaris Genuair Phase III clinical development programme included 269 patients treated with \nBretaris Genuair 322 \u00b5g twice daily in one 6-month randomised, placebo-controlled study and \n190 patients treated with Bretaris Genuair 322 \u00b5g twice daily in one 3-month randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled study. Efficacy was assessed by measures of lung function and symptomatic outcomes such \nas breathlessness, disease-specific health status, use of rescue medication and occurrence of \nexacerbations. In the long-term safety studies, Bretaris Genuair was associated with bronchodilatory \nefficacy when administered over a 1-year treatment period.\n\nBronchodilation\nIn the 6-month study, patients receiving Bretaris Genuair 322 \u00b5g twice daily experienced a clinically \nmeaningful improvement in their lung function (as measured by FEV1). Maximal bronchodilatory\neffects were evident from day one and were maintained over the 6-month treatment period. After \n6 months treatment, the mean improvement in morning pre-dose (trough) FEV1 compared to placebo \nwas 128 mL (95% CI=85-170; p<0.0001).\nSimilar observations were made with Bretaris Genuair in the 3 month study.\n\nDisease-Specific Health Status and Symptomatic Benefits\nBretaris Genuair provided clinically meaningful improvements in breathlessness (assessed using the \nTransition Dyspnoea Index [TDI]) and disease-specific health status (assessed using the St. George\u2019s \nRespiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]). The Table below shows symptom relief obtained after 6 months \ntreatment with Bretaris Genuair.\n\nVariable\nTreatment Improvement over \n\nplacebo\np-value\n\nBretaris Genuair Placebo\n\nTDI\nPercentage of Patients who \nachieved MCIDa\n\n56.9 45.5\n1.68-foldc increase \n\nin likelihood\n0.004\n\nMean Change from baseline 1.9 0.9 1.0 unit <0.001\n\nSGRQ\n\nPercentage of Patients who \nachieved MCIDb\n\n57.3 41.0\n1.87-foldc increase \n\nin likelihood\n<0.001\n\nMean Change from baseline -7.4 -2.8 - 4.6 units <0.0001\n\na Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of at least 1 unit change in TDI.\nb MCID of at least - 4 units change in SGRQ.\nc Odds ratio, increase in the likelihood of achieving the MCID compared to placebo.\n\nPatients treated with Bretaris Genuair required less rescue medication than patients treated with \nplacebo (a reduction of 0.95 puffs per day at 6 months [p=0.005]). Bretaris Genuair also improved \ndaily symptoms of COPD (dyspnoea, cough and sputum production) and night-time and early morning \nsymptoms.\n\nPooled efficacy analysis of the 6-month and 3-month placebo controlled studies demonstrated a \nstatistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations (requiring treatment \nwith antibiotics or corticosteroids or resulting in hospitalisations) with aclidinium 322 \u00b5g twice daily \ncompared to placebo (rate per patient per year: 0.31 vs 0.44 respectively; p=0.0149).\n\n\n\n7\n\nLong Term Safety and Efficacy Trial up to 3 years\nThe effect of aclidinium bromide on the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) \nwas assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 3630 adult \npatients between 40 and 91 years of age with moderate to very severe COPD, treated for up to \n36 months. 58.7% were male and 90.7% were Caucasian, with a mean postbronchodilator FEV1 of \n47.9% of predicted value and a mean CAT (COPD Assessment Test) of 20.7. All patients had a \nhistory of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and/or significant cardiovascular risk factors. \n59.8% of patients had at least one COPD exacerbation within the past 12 months from the screening \nvisit. Approximately 48% of enrolled patients had a prior history of at least 1 documented previous \ncardiovascular event; cerebrovascular disease (13.1%), coronary artery disease (35.4%), peripheral \nvascular disease or history of claudication (13.6%). \n\nThe study had an event-driven design and was terminated once sufficient MACE events for the \nprimary safety analysis were observed. Patients discontinued treatment if they experienced a MACE \nevent and entered into the post-treatment follow-up period during the study. 70.7% of patients \ncompleted the study per investigator assessment. The median time on-treatment in the Bretaris \nGenuair and placebo groups was 1.1 and 1 year, respectively. The median time on-study in the \nBretaris Genuair and placebo groups was approximately 1.4 and 1.3 years, respectively.\n\nThe primary safety endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE, defined as any of the \nfollowing adjudicated events: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal \nischemic stroke. The frequency of patients with at least one MACE was 3.85% vs. 4.23% patients in \nthe aclidinium and placebo groups, respectively. Bretaris Genuair did not increase the MACE risk in \npatients with COPD compared to placebo when added to current background therapy (hazard ratio \n(HR) 0.89; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.23). The upper bound of the confidence interval excluded a pre-defined \nrisk margin of 1.8.\n\nThe rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations per patient per year during the first year of \ntreatment was evaluated as the primary efficacy endpoint in the study. Patients treated with Bretaris\nGenuair showed a statistically significant reduction of 22% compared to placebo (rate ratio [RR] 0.78; \n95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; p<0.001). In addition, Bretaris Genuair showed a statistically significant \nreduction of 35% in the rate of hospitalisations due to COPD exacerbations while on-treatment during \nthe first year compared with placebo (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.89; p=0.006).\n\nThe Bretaris Genuair group showed a statistically significant delay in the time to first moderate or \nsevere exacerbation while on-treatment compared to the placebo group. Patients in the aclidinium \nbromide group had a 18% relative reduction of the risk of an exacerbation (HR 0.82; 95% CI [0.73, \n0.92], p<0.001).\n\nExercise tolerance\nIn a 3-week crossover, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study Bretaris Genuair was associated \nwith a statistically significant improvement in exercise endurance time in comparison to placebo of 58 \nseconds (95% CI=9-108; p=0.021; pre-treatment value: 486 seconds). Bretaris Genuair statistically \nsignificantly reduced lung hyperinflation at rest (functional residual capacity [FRC]=0.197 L [95% \nCI=0.321, 0.072; p=0.002]; residual volume [RV]=0.238 L [95% CI=0.396, 0.079; p=0.004]) and also \nimproved trough inspiratory capacity (by 0.078 L; 95% CI=0.01, 0.145; p=0.025) and reduced \ndyspnoea during exercise (Borg scale) (by 0.63 Borg units; 95% CI=1.11, 0.14; p=0.012).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBretaris Genuair in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use).\n\n\n\n8\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nAclidinium bromide is rapidly absorbed from the lung, achieving maximum plasma concentrations \nwithin 5 minutes of inhalation in healthy subjects, and normally within the first 15 minutes in COPD \npatients. The fraction of the inhaled dose that reaches the systemic circulation as unchanged \naclidinium is very low at less than 5%.\n\nSteady state peak plasma concentrations achieved after dry powder inhalation by COPD patients of \n400 \u00b5g aclidinium bromide were approximately 224 pg/mL. Steady-state plasma levels were attained \nwithin seven days of twice daily dosing.\n\nDistribution\nWhole lung deposition of inhaled aclidinium bromide via the Genuair inhaler averaged approximately \n30% of the metered dose.\n\nThe plasma protein binding of aclidinium bromide determined in vitro most likely corresponded to the \nprotein binding of the metabolites due to the rapid hydrolysis of aclidinium bromide in plasma; plasma \nprotein binding was 87% for the carboxylic acid metabolite and 15% for the alcohol metabolite. The \nmain plasma protein that binds aclidinium bromide is albumin.\n\nBiotransformation\nAclidinium bromide is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed to its pharmacologically inactive alcohol-\nand carboxylic acid-derivatives. The hydrolysis occurs both chemically (non-enzymatically) and \nenzymatically by esterases, butyrylcholinesterase being the main human esterase involved in the \nhydrolysis. Plasma levels of the acid metabolite are approximately 100-fold greater than those of the \nalcohol metabolite and the unchanged active substance following inhalation.\n\nThe low absolute bioavailability of inhaled aclidinium bromide (<5%) is because aclidinium bromide \nundergoes extensive systemic and pre-systemic hydrolysis whether deposited in the lung or \nswallowed.\n\nBiotransformation via CYP450 enzymes plays a minor role in the total metabolic clearance of \naclidinium bromide.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that aclidinium bromide at the therapeutic dose or its metabolites do not \ninhibit or induce any of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and do not inhibit esterases \n(carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase). In vitro studies have shown that \naclidinium bromide or the metabolites of aclidinium bromide are not substrates or inhibitors of \nP-glycoprotein.\n\nElimination\nThe terminal elimination half-life and effective half-life of aclidinium bromide are approximately 14 \nhours and 10 hours, respectively, following inhalation of twice daily 400 \u00b5g doses in COPD patients.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration of 400 \u00b5g radiolabelled aclidinium bromide to healthy subjects, \napproximately 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged aclidinium bromide in the urine. Up to 65% \nof the dose was eliminated as metabolites in the urine and up to 33% as metabolites in the faeces.\n\nFollowing inhalation of 200 \u00b5g and 400 \u00b5g of aclidinium bromide by healthy subjects or COPD \npatients, the urinary excretion of unchanged aclidinium was very low at about 0.1% of the \nadministered dose, indicating that renal clearance plays a minor role in the total aclidinium clearance \nfrom plasma.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\n\n\n9\n\nAclidinium bromide demonstrated kinetic linearity and a time-independent pharmacokinetic behaviour \nin the therapeutic range.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly patients\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of aclidinium bromide in patients with moderate to severe COPD \nappear to be similar in patients aged 40\u201359 years and in patients aged \u226570 years. Therefore, no dose \nadjustment is required for elderly COPD patients.\n\nHepatically-impaired patients\nNo studies have been performed on hepatically-impaired patients. As aclidinium bromide is \nmetabolised mainly by chemical and enzymatic cleavage in the plasma, hepatic dysfunction is very \nunlikely to alter its systemic exposure. No dose adjustment is required for hepatically-impaired COPD \npatients.\n\nRenally-impaired patients\nNo significant pharmacokinetic differences were observed between subjects with normal renal \nfunction and subjects with renal impairment. Therefore, no dose adjustment and no additional \nmonitoring are required for renally-impaired COPD patients.\n\nRace\nFollowing repeated inhalations, the systemic exposure of aclidinium bromide has been observed to be \nsimilar in Japanese and Caucasian patients.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\nBecause aclidinium bromide acts locally in the lungs and is quickly broken down in plasma there is no \ndirect relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction and development.\n\nEffects in nonclinical studies with respect to cardiovascular parameters (increased heart rates in dogs), \nreproductive toxicity (foetotoxic effects), and fertility (slight decreases in conception rate, number of \ncorpora lutea, and pre- and post-implantation losses) were observed only at exposures considered \nsufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.\n\nThe low toxicity observed in nonclinical toxicity studies is in part due to rapid metabolism of \naclidinium bromide in plasma and the lack of significant pharmacological activity of the major \nmetabolites. The safety margins for human systemic exposure with 400 \u00b5g twice daily over the no \nobserved adverse effect levels in these studies ranged from 7- to 73-fold.\n\n6.

You should discard your inhaler if you lose the cap.\n\nAdditional information\n\nWhat should you do if you accidently prepare a dose?\n\n    Figure M\n\nRED\n\n\n\n15\n\nStore your inhaler with the protective cap in place until it is time to inhale your medicine, then remove \nthe cap and start at Step 1.6.\n\nHow does the dose indicator work?\n\n\uf0b7 The dose indicator shows the total number of doses left in the inhaler (Figure N).\n\uf0b7 On first use, every inhaler contains at least 60 doses, or at least 30 doses, depending on the \n\npack size.\n\uf0b7 Each time you load a dose by pressing the green button, the dose indicator moves by a small \n\namount towards the next number (50, 40, 30, 20, 10, or 0).\n\nWhen should you get a new inhaler?\n\nYou should get a new inhaler:\n\n\uf0b7 If your inhaler appears to be damaged or if you lose the cap, or\n\uf0b7 When a red band appears in the dose indicator, this means you are nearing your last dose \n\n(Figure N), or\n\uf0b7 If your inhaler is empty (Figure O).\n\nFigure N\n\nHow do you know that your inhaler is empty?\n\nWhen the green button will not return to its full upper position and is locked in a middle position, you \nhave reached the last dose (Figure O). Even though the green button is locked, your last dose may still \nbe inhaled. After that, the inhaler cannot be used again and you should start using a new inhaler.\n\nHow should you clean the inhaler?\n\nFigure O\n\nLocked\n\nDose indicator moves slowly from \n60 to 0: 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0.\n\nDose\nindicator\n\nRed band\n\n\n\n16\n\nNEVER use water to clean the inhaler, as this may damage your medicine.\n\nIf you wish to clean your inhaler, just wipe the outside of the mouthpiece with a dry tissue or paper \ntowel.\n\n7.

What Bretaris Genuair is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Bretaris Genuair is\nThe active ingredient of Bretaris Genuair is aclidinium bromide, which belongs to a group of \nmedicines called bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relax airways and help keep bronchioles open. \nBretaris Genuair is a dry powder inhaler that uses your breath to deliver the medicine directly into \nyour lungs. This makes it easier for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients to breathe.\n\nWhat Bretaris Genuair is used for\nBretaris Genuair is indicated to help open the airways and relieve symptoms of COPD, a serious, long-\nterm lung disease characterised by breathing difficulties. Regular use of Bretaris Genuair can help you \nwhen you have ongoing shortness of breath related to your disease to help you minimise the effects of \nthe disease on your everyday life and reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD \nsymptoms for several days).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Bretaris Genuair\n\nDo not use Bretaris Genuair\n- if you are allergic to aclidinium bromide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Bretaris Genuair:\n- if you have had heart problems recently.\n- if you see halos around lights or coloured images (glaucoma).\n- if you have an enlarged prostate, problems passing urine, or a blockage in your bladder.\n\n\n\n26\n\nBretaris Genuair is indicated for maintenance treatment and should not be used to treat a sudden attack \nof breathlessness or wheezing.
