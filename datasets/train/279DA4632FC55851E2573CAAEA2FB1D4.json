This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nSIRTURO 100 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains bedaquiline fumarate equivalent to 100 mg of bedaquiline.\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach tablet contains 145 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet.\n\nUncoated, white to almost white round biconvex tablet, 11 mm in diameter, with debossing of \"T\" \nover \"207\" on one side and \"100\" on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSIRTURO is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults and adolescent patients (12 years to less than\n18 years of age and weighing at least 30 kg) when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be \ncomposed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with SIRTURO should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the\nmanagement of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nSIRTURO should be used in combination with at least three medicinal products to which the patient\u2019s \nisolate has been shown to be susceptible in vitro. If in vitro testing results are unavailable, treatment \nmay be initiated with SIRTURO in combination with at least four medicinal products to which the \npatient's isolate is likely to be susceptible. Consideration should be given to WHO guidelines when\nselecting the appropriate combination regimen. Treatment with the other agents in the regimen should \ncontinue after completion of treatment with SIRTURO. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of the medicinal products used in combination with SIRTURO for their specific dosing \nrecommendations.\n\nIt is recommended that SIRTURO is administered by directly observed therapy (DOT).\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dosage of SIRTURO is shown in the table below.\n\nTable 1: Recommended dosage of SIRTURO\nPopulation Dosing Recommendation\nAdults (18 years and older) \uf0b7 Weeks 1-2: 400 mg (4 tablets of 100 mg) once \n\ndaily\n\uf0b7 Weeks 3-24: 200 mg (2 tablets of 100 mg) \n\nthree times per week (with at least 48 hours \nbetween doses).\n\nAdolescents (12 years to less than 18 years of age \nand weighing at least 30 kg)\n\nTreatment duration\nThe total duration of treatment with SIRTURO is 24 weeks. Data on longer treatment duration is very \nlimited. In patients with extensive drug resistance, where SIRTURO is considered necessary beyond \n24 weeks to obtain a curative treatment, a longer duration of therapy may be considered only on a case \nby case basis and under close safety surveillance (see section 4.8).\n\nMissed doses\nPatients should be advised to take SIRTURO exactly as prescribed and to complete the full course of \ntherapy.\n\nIf a dose is missed during the first two weeks of treatment, patients should not make up the missed \ndose, but should continue the usual dosing schedule.\n\nIf a dose is missed from week three onwards, patients should take the missed dose of 200 mg as soon \nas possible and then resume the three times a week regimen.\n\nElderly population (\u2265 65 years of age)\nThere is limited clinical data (n = 2) on the use of SIRTURO in elderly patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for SIRTURO in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment\n(see section 5.2). SIRTURO should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(see section 5.2). SIRTURO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not \nrecommended in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease requiring \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, SIRTURO should be used with caution (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of SIRTURO in children aged < 12 years or weighing less than 30 kg have not \nyet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nSIRTURO may be included in the treatment regimen for adolescents greater than or equal to 12 years \nof age and weighing at least 30 kg with confirmed or with probable MDR-TB disease which is \ndiagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary MDR-TB, appropriate epidemiological \ncontext, and in line with international/local guidelines (see section 4.1).\n\n\n\n4\n\nMethod of administration\n\nSIRTURO should be taken orally with food, as administration with food increases oral bioavailability \nby about 2-fold (see section 5.2). SIRTURO tablets should be swallowed whole with water.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nThere are no clinical data on the use of SIRTURO to treat:\n\uf0b7 extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g. central nervous system, bone)\n\uf0b7 infections due to mycobacterial species other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\uf0b7 latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nThere are no clinical data on the use of SIRTURO as part of combination regimens used to treat \ndrug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nResistance to bedaquiline\nBedaquiline must only be used in an appropriate combination regimen for MDR-TB treatment as \nrecommended by official guidelines, such as from WHO, to prevent development of resistance to \nbedaquiline.\n\nMortality\n\nIn the 120-week C208 trial in adults where SIRTURO was administered for 24 weeks in combination \nwith a background regimen, more deaths occurred in the SIRTURO treatment group than in the \nplacebo group (see section 5.1). The imbalance in deaths is unexplained; no evidence has been found \nfor a causal relationship with SIRTURO treatment. For additional information on deaths in the C209 \ntrial, see section 5.1.\n\nCardiovascular safety\n\nBedaquiline prolongs the QTc interval. An electrocardiogram should be obtained before initiation of \ntreatment and at least monthly after starting treatment with bedaquiline. Serum potassium, calcium, \nand magnesium should be obtained at baseline and corrected if abnormal. Follow-up monitoring of \nelectrolytes should be performed if QT prolongation is detected (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nWhen bedaquiline is co-administered with other medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval\n(including delamanid and levofloxacin), an additive or synergistic effect on QT prolongation cannot be \nexcluded (see section 4.5). Caution is recommended when prescribing bedaquiline concomitantly with \nmedicinal products with a known risk of QT prolongation. In the event that co-administration of such \nmedicinal products with bedaquiline is necessary, clinical monitoring, including frequent \nelectrocardiogram assessment, is recommended.\n\nIn the event that co-administration of clofazimine with bedaquiline is necessary, clinical monitoring,\nincluding frequent electrocardiogram assessment, is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nSIRTURO treatment initiation is not recommended in patients with the following, unless the benefits \nof bedaquiline are considered to outweigh the potential risks:\n\uf0b7 Heart failure;\n\uf0b7 QT interval as corrected by the Fridericia method (QTcF) > 450 ms (confirmed by repeat\n\nelectrocardiogram);\n\uf0b7 A personal or family history of congenital QT prolongation;\n\uf0b7 A history of or ongoing hypothyroidism;\n\uf0b7 A history of or ongoing bradyarrhythmia;\n\n\n\n5\n\n\uf0b7 A history of Torsade de Pointes;\n\uf0b7 Concomitant administration of fluoroquinolone antibiotics that have a potential for significant \n\nQT prolongation (i.e., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin).\n\uf0b7 Hypokalemia\n\nSIRTURO treatment must be discontinued if the patient develops:\n\uf0b7 Clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia\n\uf0b7 A QTcF interval of > 500 ms (confirmed by repeat electrocardiogram).\n\nIf syncope occurs, an electrocardiogram should be obtained to detect any QT prolongation.\n\nHepatic safety\n\nIncreases in transaminases or aminotransferase elevations accompanied by total bilirubin \u2265 2x ULN\nwere seen in clinical trials during administration of SIRTURO with the background regimen (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored throughout the treatment course, since the increases in liver \nenzymes were slow to appear and increased gradually during the 24 weeks. Monitor symptoms and \nlaboratory tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) at baseline, monthly while on \ntreatment, and as needed. If AST or ALT exceeds 5 times the upper limit of normal then the regimen \nshould be reviewed and SIRTURO and/or any hepatotoxic background medicinal product should be \ndiscontinued.\nOther hepatotoxic medicinal products and alcohol should be avoided while on SIRTURO, especially \nin patients with diminished hepatic reserve.\n\nPaediatric patients\n\nIn adolescents weighing between 30 and 40 kg, average exposure is predicted to be higher compared \nto adult patients (see section 5.2). This may be associated with an increased risk of QT prolongation or \nhepatotoxicity.\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\n\nCYP3A4 inducers\nBedaquiline is metabolised by CYP3A4. Co-administration of bedaquiline and medicinal products that \ninduce CYP3A4 may decrease bedaquiline plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. \nCo-administration of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers used systemically should,\ntherefore, be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\nCo-administration of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the \nsystemic exposure to bedaquiline, which could potentially increase the risk of adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.5). Therefore, the combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nused systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If co-administration is \nrequired, more frequent electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is \nrecommended.\n\nPatients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n\nThere are no clinical data on the safety and efficacy of bedaquiline when co-administered with \nantiretroviral agents.\n\nThere are only limited clinical data on the efficacy of bedaquiline in HIV-infected adult patients not \nreceiving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Those patients studied all had CD4+ cell counts greater than \n250 x 106 cells/l (N = 22; see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n6\n\nLactose intolerance and lactase deficiency\n\nSIRTURO contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe elimination of bedaquiline has not been fully characterised in vivo. CYP3A4 is the major CYP \nisoenzyme involved in vitro in the metabolism of bedaquiline and the formation of the \nN-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2). Urinary excretion of bedaquiline is negligible. Bedaquiline and \nM2 are not substrates or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein.\n\nCYP3A4 inducers\n\nBedaquiline exposure may be reduced during co-administration with inducers of CYP3A4.\n\nIn an interaction study of single-dose bedaquiline and once daily rifampicin (strong inducer) in healthy \nadult subjects, the exposure (AUC) to bedaquiline was reduced by 52% [90% CI (-57; -46)]. Due to \nthe possibility of a reduction of the therapeutic effect of bedaquiline due to a decrease in systemic \nexposure, co-administration of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. efavirenz, \netravirine, rifamycins including rifampicin, rifapentine and rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. \nJohn\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) used systemically should be avoided.\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\n\nBedaquiline exposure may be increased during co-administration with inhibitors of CYP3A4.\n\nThe short-term co-administration of bedaquiline and ketoconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) in \nhealthy adult subjects increased the exposure (AUC) to bedaquiline by 22% [90% CI (12; 32)]. A \nmore pronounced effect on bedaquiline may be observed during prolonged co-administration of \nketoconazole or other inhibitors of CYP3A4.\n\nThere are no safety data from bedaquiline multiple dose trials which utilised a dose higher than the \nindicated dose. Due to the potential risk of adverse reactions due to an increase in systemic exposure, \nprolonged co-administration of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \nciprofloxacin, erythromycin, fluconazole, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, ritonavir) used systemically \nfor more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If co-administration is required, more frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nOther antituberculosis medicinal products\n\nThe short-term co-administration of bedaquiline with isoniazid/pyrazinamide in healthy adult subjects\ndid not result in clinically relevant changes in the exposure (AUC) to bedaquiline, isoniazid or \npyrazinamide. No dose-adjustment of isoniazid or pyrazinamide is required during co-administration\nwith bedaquiline.\nIn a placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium \ntuberculosis, no major impact of co-administration of bedaquiline on the pharmacokinetics of \nethambutol, kanamycin, pyrazinamide, ofloxacin or cycloserine was observed.\n\nAntiretroviral medicinal products\n\nIn an interaction study of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple-dose lopinavir/ritonavir in adults, \nexposure (AUC) to bedaquiline was increased by 22% [90% CI (11; 34)]. A more pronounced effect \non bedaquiline plasma exposures may be observed during prolonged co-administration with\nlopinavir/ritonavir. Published data on adult patients treated with bedaquiline as part of therapy for \ndrug-resistant TB and lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART have shown that bedaquiline exposure (AUC) \nover 48 hours was increased approximately 2 fold. This increase is likely due to ritonavir. If the \n\n\n\n7\n\nbenefit outweighs the risk, SIRTURO may be used with caution when co-administered with \nlopinavir/ritonavir. Increases in plasma exposure to bedaquiline would be expected when it is co-\nadministered with other ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. Of note, no change in bedaquiline \ndosing is recommended in case of co-treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or other ritonavir-boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitors. There are no data to support a lowered bedaquiline dose in such circumstances.\n\nCo-administration of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple-dose nevirapine in adults did not result in \nclinically relevant changes in the exposure to bedaquiline. Clinical data on co-administration of \nbedaquiline and antiretroviral agents in adult patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus\nand multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not available (see section 4.4). Efavirenz is a \nmoderate inducer of CYP3A4 activity and co-administration with bedaquiline may result in reduced \nbedaquiline exposure and loss of activity, and is, therefore, not recommended.\n\nQT interval prolonging medicinal products\n\nThere is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between \nbedaquiline and medicinal products that prolong the QT interval. In an interaction study of bedaquiline \nand ketoconazole in adults, a greater effect on QTc was observed after repeated dosing with \nbedaquiline and ketoconazole in combination than after repeated dosing with the individual medicinal\nproducts. An additive or synergistic effect on QT prolongation of bedaquiline when co-administered \nwith other medicinal products that prolong the QT interval cannot be excluded and frequent \nmonitoring is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nQT interval and concomitant clofazimine use\n\nIn an open label Phase IIb trial, mean increases in QTcF were larger in the 17 adult subjects who were \nusing concomitant clofazimine at week 24 (mean change from reference of 31.9 ms) than in subjects \nwho were not using concomitant clofazimine at week 24 (mean change from reference of 12.3 ms) \n(see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are limited data on the use of SIRTURO in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\nAs a precautionary measure, avoid the use of SIRTURO during pregnancy unless the benefit of \ntherapy is considered to outweigh the risks.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether bedaquiline or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.\n\nIn rats, concentrations of bedaquiline in milk were 6- to 12-fold higher than the maximum \nconcentration observed in maternal plasma. Body weight decreases in pups were noted in high dose \ngroups during the lactation period (see section 5.3).\n\nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, a decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from SIRTURO therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the infant and the benefit of therapy for the mother.\n\n\n\n8\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of bedaquiline on fertility are available. In female rats, there was no \neffect on mating or fertility with bedaquiline treatment, however some effects were observed in male \nrats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nBedaquiline may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been \nreported in some patients taking bedaquiline and should be considered when assessing a patient\u2019s\nability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nAdverse drug reactions for SIRTURO were identified from pooled Phase IIb clinical trial data (both \ncontrolled and uncontrolled, C208 and C209) containing 335 adult patients who received SIRTURO in \ncombination with a background regimen of tuberculosis medicinal products. The basis of assessment \nof causality between the adverse drug reactions and SIRTURO was not restricted to these trials, but \nalso on review of the pooled Phase I and Phase IIa safety data in adults. The most frequent adverse \ndrug reactions (> 10.0% of patients) during treatment with SIRTURO in the controlled trials were \nnausea (35.3% in the SIRTURO group vs 25.7% in the placebo group), arthralgia (29.4% vs 20.0%), \nheadache (23.5% vs 11.4%), vomiting (20.6% vs 22.9%) and dizziness (12.7% vs 11.4%). Refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products used in combination with SIRTURO \nfor their respective adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse drug reactions to SIRTURO reported from controlled trials in 102 adult patients treated with \nSIRTURO are presented in the table below.\nAdverse drug reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequency categories \nare defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100).\n\nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Frequency Category ADRs\nNervous system disorders Very Common Headache, dizziness\nCardiac disorders Common Electrocardiogram QT \n\nprolonged\nGastrointestinal disorders Very Common Nausea, vomiting\n\nCommon Diarrhoea\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Transaminases increased*\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nVery Common Arthralgia\nCommon Myalgia\n\n* Terms represented by \u2018transaminases increased\u2019 included AST increased, ALT increased, hepatic enzyme increased, \nhepatic function abnormal, and transaminases increased (see section below).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nCardiovascular\nIn the controlled Phase IIb study (C208), mean increases from baseline values in QTcF were observed \nfrom the first on-treatment assessment onwards (9.9 ms at week 1 for SIRTURO and 3.5 ms for \nplacebo). The largest mean increase from baseline values in QTcF during the 24 weeks of SIRTURO\ntreatment was 15.7 ms (at week 18). After the end of SIRTURO treatment (i.e. after week 24), QTcF \nincreases in the SIRTURO group gradually became less pronounced. The largest mean increase from \nbaseline values in QTcF in the placebo group during the first 24 weeks was 6.2 ms (also at week 18) \n(see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n9\n\nIn the Phase IIb, open label study (C209), where patients with no treatment options received other \nQT-prolonging medicinal products used to treat tuberculosis, including clofazimine, concurrent use \nwith SIRTURO resulted in additive QT prolongation, proportional to the number of QT prolonging \nmedicinal products in the treatment regimen.\nPatients receiving SIRTURO alone with no other QT prolonging medicinal product developed a \nmaximal mean QTcF increase over baseline of 23.7 ms with no QT duration in excess of 480 ms, \nwhereas patients with at least 2 other QT prolonging medicinal products developed a maximal mean \nQTcF prolongation of 30.7 ms over baseline, resulting in a QTcF duration in excess of 500 ms in one \npatient.\nThere were no documented cases of Torsade de Pointes in the safety database (see section 4.4). See\nsection 4.5, QT interval and concomitant clofazimine use, for further information regarding patients \nusing clofazimine concomitantly.\n\nIncreased transaminases\nIn study C208 (stage 1 and 2), aminotransferase elevations of at least 3 x ULN developed more \nfrequently in the SIRTURO treatment group (11/102 [10.8%] versus 6/105 [5.7%]) in the placebo \ntreatment group. In the SIRTURO treatment group, the majority of these increases occurred \nthroughout the 24 weeks of treatment and were reversible. During the investigational phase in Stage 2 \nof study C208, increased aminotransferases were reported in 7/79 (8.9%) patients in the SIRTURO \ntreatment group compared to 1/81 (1.2%) in the placebo treatment group.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety assessment of bedaquiline is based on data from 15 adolescents greater than or equal to\n14 years of age with confirmed or probable MDR-TB infection (see section 5.1). Overall, there was no \nindication of any differences in the safety profile in these adolescents compared to that observed in the\nadult population. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nCases of intentional or accidental acute overdose with bedaquiline were not reported during clinical \ntrials. In a study in 44 healthy adult subjects receiving a single 800 mg dose of SIRTURO, adverse \nreactions were consistent with those observed in clinical studies at the recommended dose (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nThere is no experience with the treatment of acute overdose with SIRTURO. General measures to \nsupport basic vital functions including monitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (QT interval) \nmonitoring should be taken in case of deliberate or accidental overdose. Further management should \nbe as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. Since \nbedaquiline is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to significantly remove bedaquiline from \nplasma. Clinical monitoring should be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: \nJ04AK05\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBedaquiline is a diarylquinoline. Bedaquiline specifically inhibits mycobacterial ATP (adenosine \n5'-triphosphate) synthase, an essential enzyme for the generation of energy in Mycobacterium \ntuberculosis. The inhibition of ATP synthase leads to bactericidal effects for both replicating and \nnon-replicating tubercle bacilli.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nBedaquiline has activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a minimal inhibitory concentration \n(MIC) for drug-sensitive as well as drug-resistant strains (multi-drug resistant including pre-\nextensively drug resistant strains, extensively drug resistant strains) in the range of \u2264 0.008-0.12 mg/l. \nThe N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) is not thought to contribute significantly to clinical efficacy \ngiven its lower average exposure (23% to 31%) in humans and lower antimycobacterial activity (3- to \n6-fold lower) compared to the parent compound.\n\nThe intracellular bactericidal activity of bedaquiline in primary peritoneal macrophages and in a \nmacrophage-like cell line was greater than its extracellular activity. Bedaquiline is also bactericidal \nagainst dormant (non-replicating) tubercle bacilli. In the mouse model for TB infection, bedaquiline\nhas demonstrated bactericidal and sterilizing activities.\n\nBedaquiline is bacteriostatic for many non-tuberculous mycobacterial species. Mycobacterium xenopi, \nMycobacterium novocastrense, Mycobacterium shimoidei and non-mycobacterial species are \nconsidered inherently resistant to bedaquiline.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\n\nWithin the concentration range achieved with the therapeutic dose, no \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship was observed in patients.\n\nMechanisms of resistance\n\nAcquired resistance mechanisms that affect bedaquiline MICs include mutations in the atpE gene, \nwhich codes for the ATP synthase target, and in the Rv0678 gene, which regulates the expression of \nthe MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux pump. Target-based mutations generated in preclinical studies lead to 8- to \n133-fold increases in bedaquiline MIC, resulting in MICs ranging from 0.25 to 4 mg/l. Efflux-based \nmutations have been seen in preclinical and clinical isolates. These lead to 2- to 8-fold increases in \nbedaquiline MICs, resulting in bedaquiline MICs ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 mg/l. The majority of \nisolates that are phenotypically resistant to bedaquiline are cross-resistant to clofazimine. Isolates that \nare resistant to clofazimine can still be susceptible to bedaquiline.\n\nThe impact of high baseline bedaquiline MICs, the presence of Rv0678 based mutations at baseline, \nand/or increased post-baseline bedaquiline MICs on microbiologic outcomes is unclear because of the \nlow incidence of such cases in the Phase II trials.\n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints\n\nWhen available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the physician with the results of\nin vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial medicinal products used in resident hospitals as \nperiodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired \npathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting a combination of antibacterial medicinal\nproducts for treatment.\n\nBreakpoints\n\nMinimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints are as follows:\nEpidemiological Cut-Off (ECOFF) 0.25 mg/l\n\n\n\n11\n\nClinical Breakpoints S \u2264 0.25 mg/l; R > 0.25 mg/l\nS = susceptible\nR = resistant\n\nCommonly susceptible species\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nInherently resistant organisms\nMycobacterium xenopi\nMycobacterium novocastrense\nMycobacterium shimoidei\nNon-mycobacterial species\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe following definitions applies for resistance categories used:\n\nMulti-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRH&R-TB): isolate resistant to at least isoniazid \nand rifampicin, but susceptible to fluoroquinolones and second line injectable agents.\nPre-extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-TB): isolate resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, \nand either any fluoroquinolone or at least one second line injectable agent (but not to both a \nfluoroquinolone and a second line injectable agent).\nExtensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB): isolate resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, any \nfluoroquinolone, and at least one second line injectable agent.\n\nA Phase IIb, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial (C208) evaluated the antibacterial \nactivity, safety, and tolerability of SIRTURO in newly diagnosed adult patients with sputum \nsmear-positive pulmonary MDRH&R- and pre-XDR-TB. Patients received SIRTURO (n = 79) or \nplacebo (n = 81) for 24 weeks, both in combination with a preferred 5-drug background regimen (BR) \nconsisting of ethionamide, kanamycin, pyrazinamide, ofloxacin, and cycloserine/terizidone. After the \n24-week investigational period, the background regimen was continued to complete 18 to 24 months \nof total multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis treatment. A final evaluation was conducted \nat Week 120. Main demographics were as follows: 63.1% were males, median age 34 years, 35% were \nBlack, and 15% were HIV positive. Cavitation in one lung was seen in 58% of patients, and in both \nlungs in 16%. For patients with full characterisation of resistance status, 76% (84/111) were infected \nwith an MDRH&R-TB strain and 24% (27/111) with a pre-XDR-TB strain.\n\nSIRTURO was administered as 400 mg once daily for the first 2 weeks, and as 200 mg 3 times/week \nfor the following 22 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcome parameter was the time to sputum culture conversion (i.e. the interval between \nthe first SIRTURO intake and the first of two consecutive negative liquid cultures from sputum \ncollected at least 25 days apart) during treatment with SIRTURO or placebo (median time to \nconversion was 83 days for the SIRTURO group, 125 days for the placebo group (hazard ratio, 95% \nCI: 2.44 [1.57; 3.80]), p < 0.0001).\n\nIn the SIRTURO group, no or only minor differences in time to culture conversion and culture \nconversion rates were observed between patients with pre-XDR-TB and patients with MDRH&R-TB.\n\nResponse rates at week 24 and week 120 (i.e. around 6 months after stopping all therapy) are\npresented in table 2.\n\nTable 2: Culture conversion Status\nCulture Conversion \nStatus, n (%)\n\nmITT population\nN SIRTURO/BR N Placebo/BR\n\nOverall responder at \nWeek 24\n\n66 52 (78.8%) 66 38 (57.6%)\n\n\n\n12\n\nPatients with \nMDRH&R-TB\n\n39 32 (82.1%) 45 28 (62.2%)\n\nPatients infected \nwith a pre-XDR-TB\n\n15 11 (73.3%) 12 4 (33.3%)\n\nOverall \nnon-responder* at \nWeek 24\n\n66 14 (21.2%) 66 28 (42.4%)\n\nOverall responder at \nWeek 120\n\n66 41 (62.1%) 66 29 (43.9%)\n\nPatients with \nMDRH&R-TB\n\n39# 27 (69.2%) 46# \u00a7 20 (43.5%)\n\nPatients infected \nwith pre-XDR-TB\n\n15# 9 (60.0%) 12# 5 (41.7%)\n\nOverall \nnon-responder* at \nWeek 120\n\n66 25 (37.9%) 66 37 (56.1%)\n\nFailure to convert 66 8 (12.1%) 66 15 (22.7%)\nRelapse\u2020 66 6 (9.1%) 66 10 (15.2%)\nDiscontinued but \nconverted\n\n66 11 (16.7%) 66 12 (18.2%)\n\n* Patients who died during the trial or discontinued the trial were considered as non-responders.\n\u2020\n\nRelapse was defined in the trial as having a positive sputum culture after or during treatment following prior sputum \nculture conversion.\n\n#\nExtent of resistance based on central laboratory drug susceptibility testing results was not available for 20 subjects in \nthe mITT population (12 in the SIRTURO group and 8 in the placebo group). These subjects were excluded from the \nsubgroup analysis by extent of resistance of M tuberculosis strain.\n\n\u00a7\nCentral laboratory drug susceptibility testing results became available for one additional placebo subject after the \nweek 24 interim analysis.\n\nStudy C209 evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 24 weeks treatment with open-label\nSIRTURO as part of an individualized treatment regimen in 233 adult patients who were sputum \nsmear positive within 6 months prior to screening. This study included patients of all three resistance \ncategories (MDRH&R-, pre-XDR- and XDR-TB).\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the time to sputum culture conversion during treatment with \nSIRTURO (median 57 days, for 205 patients with sufficient data). At week 24, sputum culture \nconversion was seen in 163/205 (79.5%) patients. Conversion rates at week 24 were highest (87.1%; \n81/93) in patients with MDRH&R-TB, 77.3% (34/44) in pre-XDR-TB patients and lowest (54.1%; \n20/37) in XDR-TB patients. Extent of resistance based on central laboratory drug susceptibility testing \nresults was not available for 32 subjects in the mITT population. These subjects were excluded from \nthe subgroup analysis by extent of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain.\n\nAt week 120, sputum culture conversion was seen in 148/205 (72.2%) patients. Conversion rates at \nweek 120 were highest (73.1%; 68/93) in patients with MDRH&R-TB, 70.5% (31/44) in pre-XDR-TB \npatients and lowest (62.2%; 23/37) in XDR-TB patients.\n\nAt both week 24 and week 120, responder rates were higher for patients on 3 or more active \nsubstances (in vitro) in their background regimen.\n\nOf the 163 patients who were responders at week 24, 139 patients (85.3%) were still responders at \nweek 120. Twenty-four of these 24-week responders (14.7%) were considered non-responders at \nweek 120, of which 19 patients had prematurely discontinued the trial while being culture converted \nand 5 patients had experienced relapse. Of the 42 patients who were non-responders at week 24, \nconfirmed culture conversion after week 24 (i.e., after bedaquiline dosing ended but the background\nregimen was continued) occurred in 9 patients (21.4%) and was maintained at week 120.\n\n\n\n13\n\nMortality\n\nIn the randomised phase IIb study (C208, stage 2) a higher rate of deaths was seen in the SIRTURO \ntreatment group (12.7%; 10/79 patients) compared to the placebo treatment group (3.7%; 3/81 \npatients). One death in the SIRTURO group and one death in the placebo group were reported after the \nweek 120 window. In the SIRTURO group, all of the five deaths due to tuberculosis occurred in \npatients whose sputum culture status at last visit was \u2018not converted\u2019. The causes of death in the \nremaining SIRTURO patients were alcohol poisoning, hepatitis/hepatic cirrhosis, septic \nshock/peritonitis, cerebrovascular accident and motor vehicle accident. One of the ten deaths in the \nSIRTURO group (due to alcohol poisoning) occurred during the 24 week treatment period. The other \nnine deaths among those treated with SIRTURO occurred after completion of treatment with this agent \n(range 86 911 days post SIRTURO; median 344 days). The observed imbalance in deaths between the \ntwo treatment groups is unexplained. No discernible pattern between death and sputum culture \nconversion, relapse, sensitivity to other medicinal products used to treat tuberculosis, human \nimmunodeficiency virus status, or severity of disease could be observed. During the trial, there was no \nevidence of antecedent significant QT prolongation or clinically significant dysrhythmia in any of the \npatients that died.\n\nIn the Phase IIb, open label study (C209), 6.9% (16/233) patients died. The most common cause of \ndeath as reported by the investigator was tuberculosis (9 patients). All but one patients who died of \ntuberculosis had not converted or had relapsed. The causes of death in the remaining patients varied.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of SIRTURO in combination with a background regimen \nwere evaluated in trial C211, a single-arm, open-label Phase II trial, including 15 patients who had a \nmedian age of 16 years (range: 14-17 years), weighed 38 to 75 kg, and were 80% female, 53.3% Black \nand 13.3% Asian. The patients had confirmed or probable MDR-TB infection and were to complete at \nleast 24 weeks of treatment. SIRTURO was administered as 400 mg once daily for the first 2 weeks \nand 200 mg 3 times/week for the following 22 weeks.\n\nIn the subset of patients with culture positive pulmonary MDR-TB at baseline, treatment with a \nregimen including bedaquiline resulted in conversion to a negative culture in 75.0% (6/8 \nmicrobiologically evaluable patients) at week 24.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSIRTURO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multi-drug resistant \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme.\nThis means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of bedaquiline have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in\nmulti-drug resistant tuberculosis-infected patients 14 years of age and older. Exposure to bedaquiline \nwas lower in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis-infected patients than in healthy subjects.\n\nAbsorption\n\nMaximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically achieved at about 5 hours post-dose. Cmax and the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased proportionally up to the highest \ndoses studied (700 mg single-dose and once daily 400 mg multiple doses). Administration of \nbedaquiline with food increased the relative bioavailability by about 2-fold compared to administration \n\n\n\n14\n\nunder fasted conditions. Therefore, bedaquiline should be taken with food to enhance its oral \nbioavailability.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe plasma protein binding of bedaquiline is > 99.9% in all species tested, including human. The \nplasma protein binding of the N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) in humans is at least 99.8%. In \nanimals, bedaquiline and its active N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) are extensively distributed to \nmost tissues, however, brain uptake was low.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nCYP3A4 was the major CYP isoenzyme involved in vitro in the metabolism of bedaquiline and the \nformation of the N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2).\n\nIn vitro, bedaquiline does not significantly inhibit the activity of any of the CYP450 enzymes tested \n(CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A4/5 and \nCYP4A) and does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 activities.\n\nBedaquiline and M2 were not substrates of P-gp in vitro. Bedaquiline was a weak OCT1, OATP1B1\nand OATP1B3 substrate in vitro, while M2 was not. Bedaquiline was not a substrate of MRP2 and\nBCRP in vitro. Bedaquiline and M2 did not inhibit the transporters P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \nBCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2 at clinically relevant concentrations \nin vitro. An in vitro study indicated a potential for bedaquiline to inhibit BCRP at the concentrations \nachieved in the intestine after oral administration. The clinical relevance is unknown.\n\nElimination\n\nBased on the preclinical studies, the bulk of the administered dose is eliminated in faeces. The urinary \nexcretion of unchanged bedaquiline was < 0.001% of the dose in clinical studies, indicating that renal \nclearance of unchanged active substance is insignificant. After reaching Cmax, bedaquiline \nconcentrations decline tri-exponentially. The mean terminal elimination half-life of both bedaquiline \nand the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) is about 5 months (ranging from 2 to 8 months). \nThis long terminal elimination phase likely reflects slow release of bedaquiline and M2 from \nperipheral tissues.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nA single-dose study of SIRTURO in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) \ndemonstrated exposure to bedaquiline and M2 (AUC672h) was 19% lower compared to healthy \nsubjects. No dose adjustment is deemed necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment. Bedaquiline has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nSIRTURO has mainly been studied in patients with normal renal function. Renal excretion of \nunchanged bedaquiline is insignificant (< 0.001%).\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of tuberculosis patients treated with SIRTURO 200 mg three \ntimes a week, creatinine clearance (range: 40 to 227 ml/min) was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetic parameters of bedaquiline. It is therefore not expected that mild or moderate renal \nimpairment will have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to bedaquiline. However, in patients \nwith severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease requiring \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, bedaquiline concentrations may be increased due to alteration of \nactive substance absorption, distribution, and metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. As \n\n\n\n15\n\nbedaquiline is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed from \nplasma by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\nPaediatric patients\nThe average plasma exposure of bedaquiline (AUC168h) at week 24 was predicted to be 178 \u00b5g*h/mL \n(90% prediction interval: 55.8-383 \u00b5g*h/mL) in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years and \nweighing at least 30 kg receiving the adult dose regimen of SIRTURO (400 mg once daily for the first \n2 weeks and 200 mg 3 times/week for the following 22 weeks). In adolescents weighing from \n30 to 40 kg, the average plasma exposure of bedaquiline (AUC168h) at week 24 was predicted to be \nhigher (average: 224 \u00b5g*h/mL; 90% prediction interval: 77.4-474 \u00b5g*h/mL) compared to adult \npatients. The average plasma exposure of bedaquiline (AUC168h) at week 24 in adults was predicted to \nbe 127 \u00b5g*h/mL (90% prediction interval: 39.7-249 \u00b5g*h/mL).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of SIRTURO in paediatric patients less than 14 years of age or weighing less \nthan 38 kg have not been evaluated.\n\nElderly patients\nThere is limited clinical data (n = 2) on the use of SIRTURO in tuberculosis patients aged 65 years \nand older.\n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of tuberculosis patients (age range 18 years to 68 years)\ntreated with SIRTURO age was not found to influence the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline.\n\nRace\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of tuberculosis patients treated with SIRTURO, exposure to \nbedaquiline was found to be lower in Black patients than in patients from other race categories. This \nlow exposure was not considered to be clinically relevant as no clear relationship between exposure to \nbedaquiline and response has been observed in clinical trials. Furthermore, response rates in patients \nthat completed the bedaquiline treatment period were comparable between different race categories in \nthe clinical trials.\n\nGender\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of tuberculosis patients treated with SIRTURO no clinically \nrelevant difference in exposure between men and women were observed.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted with bedaquiline administration up to 3 months in \nmice, up to 6 months in rats, and up to 9 months in dogs. The plasma bedaquiline exposure (AUC) in \nrats and dogs was similar to that observed in humans. Bedaquiline was associated with effects in target \norgans which included monocytic phagocytic system (MPS), skeletal muscle, liver, stomach, pancreas \nand heart muscle. All of these toxicities except effects on MPS were monitored clinically. In the MPS \nof all species, pigment-laden and/or foamy macrophages were also seen in various tissues, consistent \nwith phospholipidosis. The significance of phospholipidosis in humans is unknown. Most of the \nobserved changes occurred after prolonged daily dosing and subsequent increases in plasma and tissue \nconcentrations of the active substance. After treatment cessation, all indications of toxicity exhibited at \nleast partial recovery to good recovery.\n\nIn a rat carcinogenicity study, bedaquiline, at the high doses of 20 mg/kg/day in males and \n10 mg/kg/day in females, did not induce any treatment-related increases in tumour incidences.\nCompared to the exposures (AUC) observed in subjects with MDR-TB in the bedaquiline phase II\ntrials, the exposures (AUC) in rats at high doses were similar in males and 2-fold higher in females for \nbedaquiline, and 3-fold higher in males and 2-fold higher in females for M2.\n\nIn vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests indicated that bedaquiline did not have any mutagenic or \nclastogenic effects.\n\n\n\n16\n\nBedaquiline had no effects on fertility when evaluated in female rats. Three of 24 male rats treated \nwith high bedaquiline doses failed to produce offspring in the fertility study. Normal spermatogenesis \nand a normal amount of spermatozoa in the epidydimides were noted in these animals. No structural \nabnormalities in the testes and epididymides were seen after up to 6-months of bedaquiline treatment. \nNo relevant bedaquiline-related effects on developmental toxicity parameters were observed in rats \nand rabbits. The corresponding plasma exposure (AUC) was 2-fold higher in rats compared to \nhumans. In the rat, no adverse effects were observed in a pre- and post-natal development study at \nmaternal plasma exposure (AUC) similar to humans and exposure in the offspring 3-fold higher than \nin adult humans. There was no effect of maternal treatment with bedaquiline at any dose level on \nsexual maturation, behavioural development, mating performance, fertility or reproductive capacity of \nthe F1 generation animals. Body weight decreases in pups were noted in high dose groups during the \nlactation period after exposure to bedaquiline via milk and were not a consequence of in utero\nexposure. Concentrations of bedaquiline in milk were 6- to12-fold higher that the maximum \nconcentration observed in maternal plasma.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that bedaquiline has the potential to be persistent, \nbioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (see section 6.6).\n\n6.
