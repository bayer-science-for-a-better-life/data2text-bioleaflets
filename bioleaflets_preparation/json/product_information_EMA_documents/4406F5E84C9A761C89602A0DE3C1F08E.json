CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions \n\n(7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and \n\nolder. \n \n\nEXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when \n\ndeferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: \n\n- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood \n\ntransfusions (7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to \n\ninfrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and \n\nolder, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. \n \n\nEXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when \n\ndeferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with EXJADE should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the \n\ntreatment of chronic iron overload. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTransfusional iron overload \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about \n\n100 ml/kg) of packed red blood cells (PRBC) or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that \n\nchronic iron overload is present (e.g. serum ferritin >1,000 µg/l). Doses (in mg/kg) must be calculated \n\nand rounded to the nearest whole tablet size. \n\n \n\nThe goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, \n\nas required, to reduce the existing iron burden. \n\n \n\nCaution should be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn case of switching from film-coated tablets/granules to dispersible tablets, the dose of dispersible \n\ntablets should be 40% higher than the dose of film-coated tablets/granules, rounded to the nearest \n\nwhole tablet. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding doses for the different formulations are shown in the table below. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nTable 1 Recommended doses for transfusional iron overload \n\n \n\n Film-coated \n\ntablets/granules \n\nDispersible tablets Transfusions  Serum \n\nferritin \n\nStarting dose 14 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day After 20 units \n\n(about 100 ml/kg) \n\nof PRBC \n\nor >1,000 µg/l \n\nAlternative \n\nstarting doses \n\n21 mg/kg/day 30 mg/kg/day >14 ml/kg/month \n\nof PRBC (approx. \n\n>4 units/month \n\nfor an adult) \n\n  \n\n 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day <7 ml/kg/month \n\nof PRBC (approx. \n\n<2 units/month \n\nfor an adult) \n\n  \n\nFor patients \n\nwell managed \n\non \n\ndeferoxamine \n\nOne third of \n\ndeferoxamine dose \n\nHalf of \n\ndeferoxamine dose \n\n   \n\nMonitoring     Monthly \n\nTarget range     500-1,000 µg/l \n\n      \n\nAdjustment \n\nsteps \n(every \n\n3-6 months) \n\nIncrease   >2,500 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day \n\nUp to 28 mg/kg/day \n\n5-10 mg/kg/day \n\nUp to 40 mg/kg/day \n\n   \n\nDecrease    \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day   <2,500 µg/l \n\nIn patients treated \n\nwith doses \n\n>21 mg/kg/day \n\nIn patients treated \n\nwith doses \n\n>30 mg/kg/day \n\n   \n\n- When target is reached   500-1,000 µg/l \n\nMaximum \n\ndose \n\n28 mg/kg/day 40 mg/kg/day    \n\nConsider \n\ninterruption \n\n    <500 µg/l \n\n \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE dispersible tablets is 20 mg/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nAn initial daily dose of 30 mg/kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated \n\nbody iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n\n(approximately >4 units/month for an adult). \n\n \n\nAn initial daily dose of 10 mg/kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body \n\niron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n\n(approximately <2 units/month for an adult). The patient’s response must be monitored and a dose \n\nincrease should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nFor patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE \n\ndispersible tablets that is numerically half that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e.g. a \n\npatient receiving 40 mg/kg/day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be \n\ntransferred to a starting daily dose of 20 mg/kg/day of EXJADE dispersible tablets). When this results \n\nin a daily dose less than 20 mg/kg body weight, the patient’s response must be monitored and a dose \n\nincrease should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of EXJADE be \n\nadjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin. Dose adjustments \n\nmay be made in steps of 5 to 10 mg/kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient’s response and \n\ntherapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden). In patients not adequately controlled with \n\ndoses of 30 mg/kg (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 µg/l and not showing a \n\ndecreasing trend over time), doses of up to 40 mg/kg may be considered. The availability of long-term \n\nefficacy and safety data with EXJADE dispersible tablets used at doses above 30 mg/kg is currently \n\nlimited (264 patients followed for an average of 1 year after dose escalation). If only very poor \n\nhaemosiderosis control is achieved at doses up to 30 mg/kg, a further increase (to a maximum of \n\n40 mg/kg) may not achieve satisfactory control, and alternative treatment options may be considered. \n\nIf no satisfactory control is achieved at doses above 30 mg/kg, treatment at such doses should not be \n\nmaintained and alternative treatment options should be considered whenever possible. Doses above \n\n40 mg/kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with doses above this level. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with doses greater than 30 mg/kg, dose reductions in steps of 5 to 10 mg/kg should \n\nbe considered when control has been achieved (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently below 2,500 µg/l \n\nand showing a decreasing trend over time). In patients whose serum ferritin level has reached the \n\ntarget (usually between 500 and 1,000 µg/l), dose reductions in steps of 5 to 10 mg/kg should be \n\nconsidered to maintain serum ferritin levels within the target range and to minimise the risk of \n\noverchelation. If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/l, an interruption of treatment should \n\nbe considered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\n \n\nChelation therapy should only be initiated when there is evidence of iron overload (liver iron \n\nconcentration [LIC] ≥5 mg Fe/g dry weight [dw] or serum ferritin consistently >800 µg/l). LIC is the \n\npreferred method of iron overload determination and should be used wherever available. Caution \n\nshould be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn case of switching from film-coated tablets/granules to dispersible tablets, the dose of dispersible \n\ntablets should be 40% higher than the dose of film-coated tablets/granules, rounded to the nearest \n\nwhole tablet. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding doses for the different formulations are shown in the table below. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Recommended doses for non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\n \n\n Film-coated \n\ntablets/granules \n\nDispersible \n\ntablets \n\nLiver iron \n\nconcentration \n\n(LIC)* \n\n Serum \n\nferritin \n\nStarting dose 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day ≥5 mg Fe/g dw or >800 µg/l \n\nMonitoring     Monthly \n\nAdjustment \n\nsteps \n(every \n\n3-6 months) \n\nIncrease ≥7 mg Fe/g dw or >2,000 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day    \n\nDecrease <7 mg Fe/g dw or ≤2,000 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day    \n\nMaximum \n\ndose \n\n14 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day    \n\n 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day    \n\n For adults not assessed and ≤2,000 µg/l \n For paediatric patients    \n\nInterruption   <3 mg Fe/g dw or <300 µg/l \n\nRetreatment   Not recommended \n\n*LIC is the preferred method of iron overload determination. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE dispersible tablets in patients with \n\nnon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes is 10 mg/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month to assess the patient’s response to \n\ntherapy and to minimise the risk of overchelation (see section 4.4). After every 3 to 6 months of \n\ntreatment, a dose increase in increments of 5 to 10 mg/kg should be considered if the patient’s LIC is \n\n≥7 mg Fe/g dw, or if serum ferritin is consistently >2,000 µg/l and not showing a downward trend, and \n\nthe patient is tolerating the medicinal product well. Doses above 20 mg/kg are not recommended \n\nbecause there is no experience with doses above this level in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes. \n\n \n\nIn patients in whom LIC was not assessed and serum ferritin is ≤2,000 µg/l, dosing should not exceed \n\n10 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nFor patients in whom the dose was increased to >10 mg/kg, dose reduction to 10 mg/kg or less is \n\nrecommended when LIC is <7 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin is ≤2,000 µg/l. \n\n \n\nTreatment cessation \n\nOnce a satisfactory body iron level has been achieved (LIC <3 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin \n\n<300 µg/l), treatment should be stopped. There are no data available on the retreatment of patients \n\nwho reaccumulate iron after having achieved a satisfactory body iron level and therefore retreatment \n\ncannot be recommended. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥65 years of age) \n\nThe dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above. In clinical studies, \n\nelderly patients experienced a higher frequency of adverse reactions than younger patients (in \n\nparticular, diarrhoea) and should be monitored closely for adverse reactions that may require a dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTransfusional iron overload: \n\nThe dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years with transfusional iron \n\noverload are the same as for adult patients (see section 4.2). It is recommended that serum ferritin be \n\nmonitored every month to assess the patient’s response to therapy and to minimise the risk of \n\noverchelation (see section 4.4). Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into \n\naccount when calculating the dose. \n\n \n\nIn children with transfusional iron overload aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in \n\nadults (see section 5.2). This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in \n\nadults. However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration. \n\n \n\nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes: \n\nIn paediatric patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, dosing should not \n\nexceed 10 mg/kg. In these patients, closer monitoring of LIC and serum ferritin is essential to avoid \n\noverchelation (see section 4.4). In addition to monthly serum ferritin assessments, LIC should be \n\nmonitored every three months when serum ferritin is ≤800 µg/l. \n\n \n\nChildren from birth to 23 months: \n\nThe safety and efficacy of EXJADE in children from birth to 23 months of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nEXJADE has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with \n\nestimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nEXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In \n\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the dose should be considerably \n\nreduced followed by progressive increase up to a limit of 50% (see sections 4.4 and 5.2), and EXJADE \n\nmust be used with caution in such patients. Hepatic function in all patients should be monitored before \n\ntreatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and then every month (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor oral use. \n\nEXJADE dispersible tablets must be taken once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before \n\nfood, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe dispersible tablets are dispersed by stirring in a glass of water or orange or apple juice (100 to \n\n200 ml) until a fine suspension is obtained. After the suspension has been swallowed, any residue must \n\nbe resuspended in a small volume of water or juice and swallowed. The tablets must not be chewed or \n\nswallowed whole (see also section 6.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nCombination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been \n\nestablished (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients with estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nDeferasirox has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the \n\nage-appropriate normal range. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine of >33% on ≥2 consecutive occasions, \n\nsometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients. These were \n\ndose-dependent. About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below \n\nthe 33% level without dose adjustment. In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not \n\nalways respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption. In some cases, only a stabilisation of the \n\nserum creatinine values has been observed after dose reduction. Cases of acute renal failure have been \n\nreported following post-marketing use of deferasirox (see section 4.8). In some post-marketing cases, \n\nrenal function deterioration has led to renal failure requiring temporary or permanent dialysis. \n\n \n\nThe causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated. Particular attention should \n\ntherefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving \n\nmedicinal products that depress renal function, and in patients who are receiving high doses of \n\ndeferasirox and/or low rates of transfusion (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells or \n\n<2 units/month for an adult). While no increase in renal adverse events was observed after dose \n\nescalation of EXJADE dispersible tablets to doses above 30 mg/kg in clinical studies, an increased risk \n\nof renal adverse events with EXJADE dispersible tablet doses above 30 mg/kg cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nIt is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy. Serum \n\ncreatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and \n\nwith the Schwartz formula in children) and/or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored prior to \n\ntherapy, weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE \n\n(including switch of formulation), and monthly thereafter. Patients with pre-existing renal \n\nconditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more \n\nat risk of complications. Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop \n\ndiarrhoea or vomiting. \n\n \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis occurring during treatment with \n\ndeferasirox. The majority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi \n\nsyndrome) or diarrhoea, or conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication. Acid-base \n\nbalance should be monitored as clinically indicated in these populations. Interruption of EXJADE \n\ntherapy should be considered in patients who develop metabolic acidosis. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing cases of severe forms of renal tubulopathy (such as Fanconi syndrome) and renal \n\nfailure associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy \n\nhave been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, mainly in children. It is recommended that \n\nhyperammonaemic encephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who \n\ndevelop unexplained changes in mental status while on Exjade therapy. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Dose adjustment and interruption of treatment for renal monitoring \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances. \n\n \n\n Serum creatinine  Creatinine clearance \n\nBefore initiation of \n\ntherapy \n\nTwice (2x) and Once (1x) \n\nContraindicated   <60 ml/min \n\nMonitoring    \n\n- First month after \n\nstart of therapy or \n\ndose modification \n\n(including switch \n\nof formulation) \n\nWeekly and Weekly \n\n- Thereafter Monthly and Monthly \n\nReduction of daily dose by 10 mg/kg/day (dispersible tablet formulation), \n\nif following renal parameters are observed at two consecutive visits and cannot be attributed to \n\nother causes \n\nAdult patients >33% above pre-\n\ntreatment average \n\nand Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\nPaediatric patients > age appropriate \n\nULN**  \n\nand/or Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\nAfter dose reduction, interrupt treatment, if \n\nAdult and paediatric Remains >33% above \n\npre-treatment average \n\nand/or Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\n*LLN: lower limit of the normal range \n\n**ULN: upper limit of the normal range \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nDose reduction or interruption may be also considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of \n\nrenal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated: \n\n• Proteinuria (test should be performed prior to therapy and monthly thereafter) \n\n• Glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria (monitor as needed). \n\nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \n\nwith EXJADE. \n\n \n\nPatients should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal \n\nbiopsy) may be considered if the following occur despite dose reduction and interruption: \n\n• Serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and \n\n• Persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e.g. proteinuria, Fanconi Syndrome). \n\n \n\nHepatic function \n\n \n\nLiver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with deferasirox. Post-marketing \n\ncases of hepatic failure, some of which were fatal, have been reported. Severe forms associated with \n\nchanges in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, may occur in patients \n\ntreated with deferasirox, particularly in children. It is recommended that hyperammonaemic \n\nencephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who develop unexplained \n\nchanges in mental status while on Exjade therapy. Care should be taken to maintain adequate \n\nhydration in patients who experience volume-depleting events (such as diarrhoea or vomiting), \n\nparticularly in children with acute illness. Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with \n\nsignificant comorbidities including pre-existing chronic liver conditions (including cirrhosis and \nhepatitis C) and multi-organ failure. The role of deferasirox as a contributing or aggravating factor \n\ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the \n\ninitiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter. If there is a \n\npersistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other \n\ncauses, EXJADE should be interrupted. Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has \n\nbeen clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose \n\nfollowed by gradual dose escalation may be considered. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nTable 4 Summary of safety monitoring recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn patients with a short life expectancy (e.g. high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes), especially when \n\nco-morbidities could increase the risk of adverse events, the benefit of EXJADE might be limited and \n\nmay be inferior to risks. As a consequence, treatment with EXJADE is not recommended in these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nCaution should be used in elderly patients due to a higher frequency of adverse reactions (in particular, \n\ndiarrhoea). \n\n \n\nData in children with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia are very limited (see section 5.1). As a \n\nconsequence, EXJADE therapy should be closely monitored to detect adverse reactions and to follow \n\niron burden in the paediatric population. In addition, before treating heavily iron-overloaded children \n\nwith non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia with EXJADE, the physician should be aware that the \n\nconsequences of long-term exposure in such patients are currently not known. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nUpper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children \n\nand adolescents, receiving deferasirox. Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see \n\nsection 4.8). There have been reports of ulcers complicated with digestive perforation. Also, there \n\nhave been reports of fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhages, especially in elderly patients who had \n\nhaematological malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Physicians and patients should remain alert \n\nfor signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during EXJADE therapy. In \n\ncase of gastrointestinal ulceration or haemorrhage, EXJADE should be discontinued and additional \n\nevaluation and treatment must be promptly initiated. Caution should be exercised in patients who are \n\ntaking EXJADE in combination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as \n\nNSAIDs, corticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates, in patients receiving anticoagulants and in patients \n\nwith platelet counts below 50,000/mm3 (50 x 109/l) (see section 4.5). \n\nTest Frequency \n\nSerum creatinine In duplicate prior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \n\nafter dose modification (including switch \n\nof formulation). \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nCreatinine clearance and/or plasma \n\ncystatin C \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \n\nafter dose modification (including switch \n\nof formulation). \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nProteinuria Prior to therapy. \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nOther markers of renal tubular function \n\n(such as glycosuria in non-diabetics and \n\nlow levels of serum potassium, \n\nphosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria) \n\nAs needed. \n\nSerum transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline \n\nphosphatase \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nEvery 2 weeks during first month of \n\ntherapy. \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nAuditory and ophthalmic testing Prior to therapy. \n\nAnnually thereafter. \n\nBody weight, height and sexual \n\ndevelopment \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nAnnually in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nSkin disorders \n\nSkin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment. The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases. \n\nWhen interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of \n\nthe rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation. In severe cases this reintroduction could \n\nbe conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration. Severe cutaneous \n\nadverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which could be \n\nlife-threatening or fatal, have been reported. If any SCAR is suspected, EXJADE should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and should not be reintroduced. At the time of prescription, patients should \n\nbe advised of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nCases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported \n\nin patients receiving deferasirox, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases \n\nwithin the first month of treatment (see section 4.8). If such reactions occur, EXJADE should be \n\ndiscontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted. Deferasirox should not be reintroduced \n\nin patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction due to the risk of anaphylactic shock (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nVision and hearing \n\nAuditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see section \n\n4.8). Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the start of \n\ntreatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months). If disturbances are noted during the \n\ntreatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered. \n\n \n\nBlood disorders \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia (or \n\naggravation of these cytopenias) and of aggravated anaemia in patients treated with deferasirox. Most \n\nof these patients had pre-existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone \n\nmarrow failure. However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded. Interruption of \n\ntreatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia. \n\n \n\nOther considerations \n\nMonthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient’s response to \n\ntherapy and to avoid overchelation (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and \n\nhepatic function, and serum ferritin levels are recommended during periods of treatment with high \n\ndoses and when serum ferritin levels are close to the target range. If serum ferritin falls consistently \n\nbelow 500 µg/l (in transfusional iron overload) or below 300 µg/l (in non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes), an interruption of treatment should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should be \n\nrecorded and regularly assessed for trends. \n\n \n\nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \n\nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.8). However, as a general precautionary measure in \n\nthe management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and \n\nsexual development should be monitored prior to therapy and at regular intervals (every 12 months). \n\n \n\nCardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload. Cardiac function should be \n\nmonitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with EXJADE. \n\n \n\nLactose content \n\nThe dispersible tablets contain lactose. \n\n \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \n\nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThe safety of deferasirox in combination with other iron chelators has not been established. Therefore, \n\nit must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nInteraction with food \n\nThe bioavailability of deferasirox was increased to a variable extent when taken along with food. \n\nEXJADE dispersible tablets must therefore be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before \n\nfood, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAgents that may decrease EXJADE systemic exposure \n\nDeferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes. In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant \n\nadministration of deferasirox (single dose of 30 mg/kg, dispersible tablet formulation) and the potent \n\nUGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure \n\nby 44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). Therefore, the concomitant use of EXJADE with potent UGT inducers \n\n(e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in \n\nEXJADE efficacy. The patient’s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after the combination, \n\nand the dose of EXJADE adjusted if necessary. \n\n \n\nCholestyramine significantly reduced the deferasirox exposure in a mechanistic study to determine the \n\ndegree of enterohepatic recycling (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nInteraction with midazolam and other agents metabolised by CYP3A4 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox dispersible tablets and \n\nmidazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% \n\nCI: 8% - 26%). In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced. Therefore, due to a \n\npossible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with \n\nsubstances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive \n\nagents, bepridil, ergotamine). \n\n \n\nInteraction with repaglinide and other agents metabolised by CYP2C8 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 \n\ninhibitor (30 mg/kg daily, dispersible tablet formulation), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given \n\nas a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) \n\nand 1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]), respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with \n\ndosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should \n\nbe avoided. If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring \n\nshould be performed (see section 4.4). An interaction between deferasirox and other CYP2C8 \n\nsubstrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nInteraction with theophylline and other agents metabolised by CYP1A2 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a CYP1A2 inhibitor \n\n(repeated dose of 30 mg/kg/day, dispersible tablet formulation) and the CYP1A2 substrate \n\ntheophylline (single dose of 120 mg) resulted in an increase of theophylline AUC by 84% (90% CI: \n\n73% to 95%). The single dose Cmax was not affected, but an increase of theophylline Cmax is expected \n\nto occur with chronic dosing. Therefore, the concomitant use of deferasirox with theophylline is not \n\nrecommended. If deferasirox and theophylline are used concomitantly, monitoring of theophylline \n\nconcentration and theophylline dose reduction should be considered. An interaction between \n\ndeferasirox and other CYP1A2 substrates cannot be excluded. For substances that are predominantly \n\nmetabolised by CYP1A2 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. clozapine, tizanidine), the \n\nsame recommendations apply as for theophylline. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nOther information \n\nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not \n\nbeen formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not \n\nrecommended to take deferasirox tablets with aluminium-containing antacid preparations. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, \n\nsuch as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral \n\nbisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4). The concomitant \n\nadministration of deferasirox with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal \n\nhaemorrhage. Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of deferasirox and busulfan resulted in an increase of busulfan exposure \n\n(AUC), but the mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. If possible, evaluation of the \n\npharmacokinetics (AUC, clearance) of a busulfan test dose should be performed to allow dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox. Studies in animals have shown \n\nsome reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nAs a precaution, it is recommended that EXJADE is not used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nEXJADE may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Women of \n\nchildbearing potential are recommended to use additional or alternative non-hormonal methods of \n\ncontraception when using EXJADE. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIn animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk. No \n\neffect on the offspring was noted. It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk. \n\nBreast-feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo fertility data is available for humans. In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility \n\nwere found (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEXJADE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing the \n\nuncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or operating machines \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment with deferasirox dispersible tablets in \n\nadult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances (mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea \n\nor abdominal pain) and skin rash. Diarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 \n\nto 5 years and in the elderly. These reactions are dose-dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally \n\ntransient and mostly resolve even if treatment is continued. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical studies, dose-dependent increases in serum creatinine occurred in about 36% of \n\npatients, though most remained within the normal range. Decreases in mean creatinine clearance have \n\nbeen observed in both paediatric and adult patients with beta-thalassemia and iron overload during the \n\nfirst year of treatment, but there is evidence that this does not decrease further in subsequent years of \n\ntreatment. Elevations of liver transaminases have been reported. Safety monitoring schedules for renal \n\nand liver parameters are recommended. Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) \n\ndisturbances are uncommon, and yearly examinations are also recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\nhave been reported with the use of EXJADE (see section 4.4). \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

These are derived from \n\nspontaneous reports for which it is not always possible to reliably establish frequency or a \n\ncausal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product. \n2 Severe forms associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic \n\nencephalopathy have been reported. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nGallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients. Elevations of liver \n\ntransaminases were reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of patients. Elevations of transaminases \n\ngreater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon \n\n(0.3%). During post-marketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with \n\ndeferasirox (see section 4.4). There have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis. The \n\nmajority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi syndrome) or diarrhoea, \n\nor conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication (see section 4.4). Cases of serious \n\nacute pancreatitis were observed without documented underlying biliary conditions. As with other iron \n\nchelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been \n\nuncommonly observed in patients treated with deferasirox (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance in transfusional iron overload \n\nIn a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 adult and paediatric beta-thalassaemia patients with \n\ntransfusional iron overload treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets in two randomised and four \n\nopen label studies of up to five years’ duration, a mean creatinine clearance decrease of 13.2% in adult \n\npatients (95% CI: -14.4% to -12.1%; n=935) and 9.9% (95% CI: -11.1% to -8.6%; n=1,142) in \n\npaediatric patients was observed during the first year of treatment. In 250 patients who were followed \n\nfor up to five years, no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed. \n\n \n\nClinical study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\nIn a 1-year study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron \n\noverload (dispersible tablets at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day), diarrhoea (9.1%), rash (9.1%), and nausea \n\n(7.3%) were the most frequent study drug-related adverse events. Abnormal serum creatinine and \n\ncreatinine clearance values were reported in 5.5% and 1.8% of patients, respectively. Elevations of \n\nliver transaminases greater than 2 times the baseline and 5 times the upper limit of normal were \n\nreported in 1.8% of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \n\nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients. \n\n \n\nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \n\nwith deferasirox. In post-marketing reports, a high proportion of cases of metabolic acidosis occurred \nin children in the context of Fanconi syndrome. \n\n \n\nAcute pancreatitis has been reported, particularly in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nEarly signs of acute overdose are digestive effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and \n\nvomiting. Hepatic and renal disorders have been reported, including cases of liver enzyme and \n\ncreatinine increased with recovery after treatment discontinuation. An erroneously administered single \n\ndose of 90 mg/kg led to Fanconi syndrome which resolved after treatment. \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for deferasirox. Standard procedures for management of overdose may be \n\nindicated as well as symptomatic treatment, as medically appropriate. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Iron chelating agents, ATC code: V03AC03 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nDeferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III). It is a tridentate ligand that \n\nbinds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the \n\nfaeces. Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels \n\nof these metals. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, deferasirox at daily \n\ndoses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, \n\n0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight/day, respectively. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nClinical efficacy studies were conducted with deferasirox dispersible tablets. \n\n \n\nDeferasirox has been investigated in 411 adult (age 16 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to \n\n<16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions. Of the paediatric patients 52 were \n\naged 2 to 5 years. The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle \n\ncell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], \n\nDiamond-Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias). \n\n \n\nDaily treatment with the deferasirox dispersible tablet formulation at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg for one \n\nyear in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in \n\nindicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/g liver \n\n(biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 \n\nand -926 µg/l on average, respectively. At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake \n\nwere 1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively. \n\nDeferasirox induced similar responses in iron-overloaded patients with other anaemias. Daily doses of \n\n10 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin \n\nlevels and induce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange \n\ntransfusions. Serum ferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron \n\nconcentration indicating that trends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy. \n\nLimited clinical data (29 patients with normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that \n\ntreatment with deferasirox 10-30 mg/kg/day (dispersible tablet formulation) for 1 year may also \n\nreduce levels of iron in the heart (on average, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds). \n\n \n\nThe principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from \n\nbeta-thalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of deferasirox \n\ndispersible tablets to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population. It appeared from a \n\npost-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration ≥7 mg \n\nFe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (20 and 30 mg/kg) or deferoxamine (35 to \n\n≥50 mg/kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved. However, in patients with liver iron \n\nconcentration <7 mg Fe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (5 and 10 mg/kg) or \n\ndeferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of \n\nthe two chelators. This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain \n\non their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose. Fifty-six patients under \n\nthe age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving deferasirox dispersible \n\ntablets. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nIt appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that deferasirox dispersible tablets could be as active \n\nas deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i.e. a dose of deferasirox dispersible tablets that is \n\nnumerically half of the deferoxamine dose). However, this dosing recommendation was not \n\nprospectively assessed in the clinical studies. \n\n \n\nIn addition, in patients with liver iron concentration ≥7 mg Fe/g dw with various rare anaemias or \n\nsickle cell disease, deferasirox dispersible tablets up to 20 and 30 mg/kg produced a decrease in liver \n\niron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia. \n\n \n\nA placebo-controlled randomised study was performed in 225 patients with MDS (Low/Int-1 risk) and \n\ntransfusional iron overload. The results of this study suggest that there is a positive impact of \n\ndeferasirox on event-free survival (EFS, a composite endpoint including non-fatal cardiac or liver \n\nevents) and serum ferritin levels. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies in adult MDS \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nIn a 5-year observational study in which 267 children aged 2 to <6 years (at enrollment) with \n\ntransfusional haemosiderosis received deferasirox, there were no clinically meaningful differences in \n\nthe safety and tolerability profile of Exjade in paediatric patients aged 2 to <6 years compared to the \n\noverall adult and older paediatric population, including increases in serum creatinine of >33% and \n\nabove the upper limit of normal on ≥2 consecutive occasions (3.1%), and elevation of alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (4.3%). Single events of \n\nincrease in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported in 20.0% and 8.3%, respectively, of the \n\n145 patients who completed the study. \n \n\nIn a study to assess the safety of deferasirox film-coated and dispersible tablets, 173 adult and \n\npaediatric patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were treated \n\nfor 24 weeks. A comparable safety profile for film-coated and dispersible tablets was observed. \n\n \n\nIn patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron overload, treatment with \n\ndeferasirox dispersible tablets was assessed in a 1-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\nstudy. The study compared the efficacy of two different deferasirox dispersible tablet regimens \n\n(starting doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, 55 patients in each arm) and of matching placebo (56 patients). \n\nThe study enrolled 145 adult and 21 paediatric patients. The primary efficacy parameter was the \n\nchange in liver iron concentration (LIC) from baseline after 12 months of treatment. One of the \n\nsecondary efficacy parameters was the change in serum ferritin between baseline and fourth quarter. \n\nAt a starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day, deferasirox dispersible tablets led to reductions in indicators of \n\ntotal body iron. On average, liver iron concentration decreased by 3.80 mg Fe/g dw in patients treated \n\nwith deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 0.38 mg Fe/g dw in \n\npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). On average, serum ferritin decreased by 222.0 µg/l in patients \n\ntreated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 115 µg/l in \n\npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\nDeferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is absorbed following oral administration with a median \n\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability \n\n(AUC) of deferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose. \n\nTotal exposure (AUC) was approximately doubled when taken along with a high-fat breakfast (fat \n\ncontent >50% of calories) and by about 50% when taken along with a standard breakfast. The \n\nbioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox was moderately (approx. 13–25%) elevated when taken \n\n30 minutes before meals with normal or high fat content. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nDeferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and \n\nhas a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nGlucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. \n\nDeconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) \n\nis likely to occur: in a healthy volunteer study, the administration of cholestyramine after a single dose \n\nof deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC). \n\n \n\nDeferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalysed \n\n(oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). No inhibition of \n\ndeferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nDeferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose). Renal excretion \n\nof deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose). The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) \n\nranged from 8 to 16 hours. The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary \n\nexcretion of deferasirox. \n\n \n\nLinearity / non-linearity \n\nThe Cmax and AUC0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state \n\nconditions. Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nThe overall exposure of adolescents (12 to ≤17 years) and children (2 to <12 years) to deferasirox after \n\nsingle and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients. In children younger than 6 years old \n\nexposure was about 50% lower than in adults. Since dosing is individually adjusted according to \n\nresponse this is not expected to have clinical consequences. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nFemales have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males. \n\nSince dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical \n\nconsequences. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older). \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The \n\npharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the \n\nupper limit of the normal range. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical study using single doses of 20 mg/kg deferasirox dispersible tablets, the average exposure \n\nwas increased by 16% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and by 76% in \n\nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) compared to subjects with normal \n\nhepatic function. The average Cmax of deferasirox in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment was increased by 22%. Exposure was increased 2.8-fold in one subject with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. The main findings were \n\nkidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts). Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile \n\nanimals. The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not \n\npreviously overloaded with iron. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nTests of genotoxicity in vitro were negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) while \n\ndeferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of \n\nnon-iron-loaded rats at lethal doses. No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats. Deferasirox \n\nwas not carcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/- heterozygous \n\nmice in a 6-month study. \n\n \n\nThe potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits. Deferasirox was not \n\nteratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high \n\ndoses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother. Deferasirox did not cause other \n\neffects on fertility or reproduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions \n\n(7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and \n\nolder. \n \n\nEXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when \n\ndeferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: \n\n- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood \n\ntransfusions (7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to \n\ninfrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and \n\nolder, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. \n \n\nEXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when \n\ndeferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with EXJADE should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the \n\ntreatment of chronic iron overload. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTransfusional iron overload \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about \n\n100 ml/kg) of packed red blood cells (PRBC) or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that \n\nchronic iron overload is present (e.g. serum ferritin >1,000 µg/l). Doses (in mg/kg) must be calculated \n\nand rounded to the nearest whole tablet size. \n\n \n\nThe goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, \n\nas required, to reduce the existing iron burden. \n\n \n\nCaution should be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEXJADE film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible \n\ntablet formulation (see section 5.2). In case of switching from dispersible tablets to film-coated tablets, \n\nthe dose of the film-coated tablets should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible tablets, \n\nrounded to the nearest whole tablet. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding doses for the different formulations are shown in the table below. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nTable 1 Recommended doses for transfusional iron overload \n\n \n\n Film-coated \n\ntablets/granules \n\nDispersible tablets Transfusions  Serum \n\nferritin \n\nStarting dose 14 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day After 20 units \n\n(about 100 ml/kg) \n\nof PRBC \n\nor >1,000 µg/l \n\nAlternative \n\nstarting doses \n\n21 mg/kg/day 30 mg/kg/day >14 ml/kg/month \n\nof PRBC (approx. \n\n>4 units/month \n\nfor an adult) \n\n  \n\n 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day <7 ml/kg/month \n\nof PRBC (approx. \n\n<2 units/month \n\nfor an adult) \n\n  \n\nFor patients \n\nwell managed \n\non \n\ndeferoxamine \n\nOne third of \n\ndeferoxamine dose \n\nHalf of \n\ndeferoxamine dose \n\n   \n\nMonitoring     Monthly \n\nTarget range     500-1,000 µg/l \n\n      \n\nAdjustment \n\nsteps \n(every \n\n3-6 months) \n\nIncrease   >2,500 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day \n\nUp to 28 mg/kg/day \n\n5-10 mg/kg/day \n\nUp to 40 mg/kg/day \n\n   \n\nDecrease    \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day   <2,500 µg/l \n\nIn patients treated \n\nwith doses \n\n>21 mg/kg/day \n\nIn patients treated \n\nwith doses \n\n>30 mg/kg/day \n\n   \n\n- When target is reached   500-1,000 µg/l \n\nMaximum \n\ndose \n\n28 mg/kg/day 40 mg/kg/day    \n\nConsider \n\ninterruption \n\n    <500 µg/l \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE film-coated tablets is 14 mg/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nAn initial daily dose of 21 mg/kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated \n\nbody iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n\n(approximately >4 units/month for an adult). \n\n \n\nAn initial daily dose of 7 mg/kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body \n\niron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n\n(approximately <2 units/month for an adult). The patient’s response must be monitored and a dose \n\nincrease should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nFor patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE \n\nfilm-coated tablets that is numerically one third that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered \n\n(e.g. a patient receiving 40 mg/kg/day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be \n\ntransferred to a starting daily dose of 14 mg/kg/day of EXJADE film-coated tablets). When this results \n\nin a daily dose less than 14 mg/kg body weight, the patient’s response must be monitored and a dose \n\nincrease should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of EXJADE be \n\nadjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin. Dose adjustments \n\nmay be made in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient’s response and \n\ntherapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden). In patients not adequately controlled with \n\ndoses of 21 mg/kg (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 µg/l and not showing a \n\ndecreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg/kg may be considered. The availability of long-term \n\nefficacy and safety data from clinical studies conducted with EXJADE dispersible tablets used at \n\ndoses above 30 mg/kg is currently limited (264 patients followed for an average of 1 year after dose \n\nescalation). If only very poor haemosiderosis control is achieved at doses up to 21 mg/kg, a further \n\nincrease (to a maximum of 28 mg/kg) may not achieve satisfactory control, and alternative treatment \n\noptions may be considered. If no satisfactory control is achieved at doses above 21 mg/kg, treatment at \n\nsuch doses should not be maintained and alternative treatment options should be considered whenever \n\npossible. Doses above 28 mg/kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with \n\ndoses above this level (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with doses greater than 21 mg/kg, dose reductions in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should \n\nbe considered when control has been achieved (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently below 2,500 µg/l \n\nand showing a decreasing trend over time). In patients whose serum ferritin level has reached the \n\ntarget (usually between 500 and 1,000 µg/l), dose reductions in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should be \n\nconsidered to maintain serum ferritin levels within the target range and to minimise the risk of \n\noverchelation. If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/l, an interruption of treatment should \n\nbe considered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\n \n\nChelation therapy should only be initiated when there is evidence of iron overload (liver iron \n\nconcentration [LIC] ≥5 mg Fe/g dry weight [dw] or serum ferritin consistently >800 µg/l). LIC is the \n\npreferred method of iron overload determination and should be used wherever available. Caution \n\nshould be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nEXJADE film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible \n\ntablet formulation (see section 5.2). In case of switching from dispersible tablets to film-coated tablets, \n\nthe dose of the film-coated tablets should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible tablets, \n\nrounded to the nearest whole tablet. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding doses for the different formulations are shown in the table below. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nTable 2 Recommended doses for non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\n \n\n Film-coated \n\ntablets/granules \n\nDispersible \n\ntablets \n\nLiver iron \n\nconcentration \n\n(LIC)* \n\n Serum \n\nferritin \n\nStarting dose 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day ≥5 mg Fe/g dw or >800 µg/l \n\nMonitoring     Monthly \n\nAdjustment \n\nsteps \n(every \n\n3-6 months) \n\nIncrease ≥7 mg Fe/g dw or >2,000 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day    \n\nDecrease <7 mg Fe/g dw or ≤2,000 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day    \n\nMaximum \n\ndose \n\n14 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day    \n\n 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day    \n\n For adults not assessed and ≤2,000 µg/l \n For paediatric patients    \n\nInterruption   <3 mg Fe/g dw or <300 µg/l \n\nRetreatment   Not recommended \n\n*LIC is the preferred method of iron overload determination. \n\n \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE film-coated tablets in patients with \n\nnon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes is 7 mg/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month to assess the patient’s response to \n\ntherapy and to minimise the risk of overchelation (see section 4.4). After every 3 to 6 months of \n\ntreatment, a dose increase in increments of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should be considered if the patient’s LIC is \n\n≥7 mg Fe/g dw, or if serum ferritin is consistently >2,000 µg/l and not showing a downward trend, and \n\nthe patient is tolerating the medicinal product well. Doses above 14 mg/kg are not recommended \n\nbecause there is no experience with doses above this level in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes. \n\n \n\nIn patients in whom LIC was not assessed and serum ferritin is ≤2,000 µg/l, dosing should not exceed \n\n7 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nFor patients in whom the dose was increased to >7 mg/kg, dose reduction to 7 mg/kg or less is \n\nrecommended when LIC is <7 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin is ≤2,000 µg/l. \n\n \n\nTreatment cessation \n\nOnce a satisfactory body iron level has been achieved (LIC <3 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin \n\n<300 µg/l), treatment should be stopped. There are no data available on the retreatment of patients \n\nwho reaccumulate iron after having achieved a satisfactory body iron level and therefore retreatment \n\ncannot be recommended. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥65 years of age) \n\nThe dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above. In clinical studies, \n\nelderly patients experienced a higher frequency of adverse reactions than younger patients (in \n\nparticular, diarrhoea) and should be monitored closely for adverse reactions that may require a dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTransfusional iron overload: \n\nThe dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years with transfusional iron \n\noverload are the same as for adult patients (see section 4.2). It is recommended that serum ferritin be \n\nmonitored every month to assess the patient’s response to therapy and to minimise the risk of \n\noverchelation (see section 4.4). Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into \n\naccount when calculating the dose. \n\n \n\nIn children with transfusional iron overload aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in \n\nadults (see section 5.2). This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in \n\nadults. However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration. \n\n \n\nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes: \n\nIn paediatric patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, dosing should not \n\nexceed 7 mg/kg. In these patients, closer monitoring of LIC and serum ferritin is essential to avoid \n\noverchelation (see section 4.4). In addition to monthly serum ferritin assessments, LIC should be \n\nmonitored every three months when serum ferritin is ≤800 µg/l. \n\n \n\nChildren from birth to 23 months: \n\nThe safety and efficacy of EXJADE in children from birth to 23 months of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nEXJADE has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with \n\nestimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nEXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In \n\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the dose should be considerably \n\nreduced followed by progressive increase up to a limit of 50% (see sections 4.4 and 5.2), and EXJADE \n\nmust be used with caution in such patients. Hepatic function in all patients should be monitored before \n\ntreatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and then every month (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor oral use. \n\n \n\nThe film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. For patients who are unable to \n\nswallow whole tablets, the film-coated tablets may be crushed and administered by sprinkling the full \n\ndose onto soft food, e.g. yogurt or apple sauce (pureed apple). The dose should be immediately and \n\ncompletely consumed, and not stored for future use. \n \n\nThe film-coated tablets should be taken once a day, preferably at the same time each day, and may be \n\ntaken on an empty stomach or with a light meal (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nCombination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been \n\nestablished (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients with estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nDeferasirox has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the \n\nage-appropriate normal range. \n\n \nDuring clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine of >33% on ≥2 consecutive occasions, \n\nsometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients. These were \n\ndose-dependent. About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below \n\nthe 33% level without dose adjustment. In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not \n\nalways respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption. In some cases, only a stabilisation of the \n\nserum creatinine values has been observed after dose reduction. Cases of acute renal failure have been \n\nreported following post-marketing use of deferasirox (see section 4.8). In some post-marketing cases, \n\nrenal function deterioration has led to renal failure requiring temporary or permanent dialysis. \n\n \n\nThe causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated. Particular attention should \n\ntherefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving \n\nmedicinal products that depress renal function, and in patients who are receiving high doses of \n\ndeferasirox and/or low rates of transfusion (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells or \n\n<2 units/month for an adult). While no increase in renal adverse events was observed after dose \n\nescalation of EXJADE dispersible tablets to doses above 30 mg/kg in clinical studies, an increased risk \n\nof renal adverse events with film-coated tablet doses above 21 mg/kg cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy. Serum \n\ncreatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and \n\nwith the Schwartz formula in children) and/or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored prior to \n\ntherapy, weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE \n\n(including switch of formulation), and monthly thereafter. Patients with pre-existing renal \n\nconditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more \n\nat risk of complications. Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop \n\ndiarrhoea or vomiting. \n\n \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis occurring during treatment with \n\ndeferasirox. The majority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi \n\nsyndrome) or diarrhoea, or conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication. Acid-base \n\nbalance should be monitored as clinically indicated in these populations. Interruption of EXJADE \n\ntherapy should be considered in patients who develop metabolic acidosis. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing cases of severe forms of renal tubulopathy (such as Fanconi syndrome) and renal \n\nfailure associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy \n\nhave been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, mainly in children. It is recommended that \n\nhyperammonaemic encephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who \n\ndevelop unexplained changes in mental status while on Exjade therapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nTable 3 Dose adjustment and interruption of treatment for renal monitoring \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances. \n\n \n\nDose reduction or interruption may be also considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of \n\nrenal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated: \n\n• Proteinuria (test should be performed prior to therapy and monthly thereafter) \n\n• Glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria (monitor as needed). \n\nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \n\nwith EXJADE. \n\n \n\nPatients should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal \n\nbiopsy) may be considered if the following occur despite dose reduction and interruption: \n\n• Serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and \n\n• Persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e.g. proteinuria, Fanconi Syndrome). \n\n \n\nHepatic function \n \n\nLiver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with deferasirox. Post-marketing \n\ncases of hepatic failure, some of which were fatal, have been reported. Severe forms associated with \n\nchanges in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, may occur in patients \n\ntreated with deferasirox, particularly in children. It is recommended that hyperammonaemic \n\nencephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who develop unexplained \n\nchanges in mental status while on Exjade therapy. Care should be taken to maintain adequate \n\nhydration in patients who experience volume-depleting events (such as diarrhoea or vomiting), \n\nparticularly in children with acute illness. Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with \n\nsignificant comorbidities including pre-existing chronic liver conditions (including cirrhosis and \n\nhepatitis C) and multi-organ failure. The role of deferasirox as a contributing or aggravating factor \n\ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n Serum creatinine  Creatinine clearance \n\nBefore initiation of \n\ntherapy \n\nTwice (2x) and Once (1x) \n\nContraindicated   <60 ml/min \n\nMonitoring    \n\n- First month after \n\nstart of therapy or \n\ndose modification \n\n(including switch \n\nof formulation) \n\nWeekly and Weekly \n\n- Thereafter Monthly and Monthly \n\nReduction of daily dose by 7 mg/kg/day (film-coated tablet formulation), \n\nif following renal parameters are observed at two consecutive visits and cannot be attributed to \n\nother causes \n\nAdult patients >33% above pre-\n\ntreatment average \n\nand Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\nPaediatric patients > age appropriate \n\nULN**  \n\nand/or Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\nAfter dose reduction, interrupt treatment, if \n\nAdult and paediatric Remains >33% above \n\npre-treatment average \n\nand/or Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\n*LLN: lower limit of the normal range \n\n**ULN: upper limit of the normal range \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nIt is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the \n\ninitiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter. If there is a \n\npersistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other \n\ncauses, EXJADE should be interrupted. Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has \n\nbeen clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose \n\nfollowed by gradual dose escalation may be considered. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Summary of safety monitoring recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn patients with a short life expectancy (e.g. high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes), especially when \n\nco-morbidities could increase the risk of adverse events, the benefit of EXJADE might be limited and \n\nmay be inferior to risks. As a consequence, treatment with EXJADE is not recommended in these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nCaution should be used in elderly patients due to a higher frequency of adverse reactions (in particular, \n\ndiarrhoea). \n\n \n\nData in children with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia are very limited (see section 5.1). As a \n\nconsequence, EXJADE therapy should be closely monitored to detect adverse reactions and to follow \n\niron burden in the paediatric population. In addition, before treating heavily iron-overloaded children \n\nwith non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia with EXJADE, the physician should be aware that the \n\nconsequences of long-term exposure in such patients are currently not known. \n\n \n\nTest Frequency \n\nSerum creatinine In duplicate prior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \n\nafter dose modification (including switch \n\nof formulation). \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nCreatinine clearance and/or plasma \n\ncystatin C \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \n\nafter dose modification (including switch \n\nof formulation). \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nProteinuria Prior to therapy. \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nOther markers of renal tubular function \n\n(such as glycosuria in non-diabetics and \n\nlow levels of serum potassium, \n\nphosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria) \n\nAs needed. \n\nSerum transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline \n\nphosphatase \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nEvery 2 weeks during first month of \n\ntherapy. \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nAuditory and ophthalmic testing Prior to therapy. \n\nAnnually thereafter. \n\nBody weight, height and sexual \n\ndevelopment \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nAnnually in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nUpper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children \n\nand adolescents, receiving deferasirox. Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see \n\nsection 4.8). There have been reports of ulcers complicated with digestive perforation. Also, there \n\nhave been reports of fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhages, especially in elderly patients who had \n\nhaematological malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Physicians and patients should remain alert \n\nfor signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during EXJADE therapy. In \n\ncase of gastrointestinal ulceration or haemorrhage, EXJADE should be discontinued and additional \n\nevaluation and treatment must be promptly initiated. Caution should be exercised in patients who are \n\ntaking EXJADE in combination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as \n\nNSAIDs, corticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates, in patients receiving anticoagulants and in patients \n\nwith platelet counts below 50,000/mm3 (50 x 109/l) (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSkin disorders \n\nSkin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment. The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases. \n\nWhen interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of \n\nthe rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation. In severe cases this reintroduction could \n\nbe conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration. Severe cutaneous \n\nadverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which could be life-\n\nthreatening or fatal, have been reported. If any SCAR is suspected, EXJADE should be discontinued \n\nimmediately and should not be reintroduced. At the time of prescription, patients should be advised of \n\nthe signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nCases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported \n\nin patients receiving deferasirox, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases \n\nwithin the first month of treatment (see section 4.8). If such reactions occur, EXJADE should be \n\ndiscontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted. Deferasirox should not be reintroduced \n\nin patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction due to the risk of anaphylactic shock (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nVision and hearing \n\nAuditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see section \n\n4.8). Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the start of \n\ntreatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months). If disturbances are noted during the \n\ntreatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered. \n\n \n\nBlood disorders \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia (or \n\naggravation of these cytopenias) and of aggravated anaemia in patients treated with deferasirox. Most \n\nof these patients had pre-existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone \n\nmarrow failure. However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded. Interruption of \n\ntreatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia. \n\n \n\nOther considerations \n\nMonthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient’s response to \n\ntherapy and to avoid overchelation (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and \n\nhepatic function, and serum ferritin levels are recommended during periods of treatments with high \n\ndoses and when serum ferritin levels are close to the target range. If serum ferritin falls consistently \n\nbelow 500 µg/l (in transfusional iron overload) or below 300 µg/l (in non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes), an interruption of treatment should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should be \n\nrecorded and regularly assessed for trends. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \n\nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.8). However, as a general precautionary measure in \n\nthe management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and \n\nsexual development should be monitored prior to therapy and at regular intervals (every 12 months). \n\n \n\nCardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload. Cardiac function should be \n\nmonitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with EXJADE. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThe safety of deferasirox in combination with other iron chelators has not been established. Therefore, \n\nit must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nInteraction with food \n\nThe Cmax of deferasirox film-coated tablets was increased (by 29%) when taken with a high-fat meal. \n\nEXJADE film-coated tablets may be taken either on an empty stomach or with a light meal, preferably \n\nat the same time each day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAgents that may decrease EXJADE systemic exposure \n\nDeferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes. In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant \n\nadministration of deferasirox (single dose of 30 mg/kg, dispersible tablet formulation) and the potent \n\nUGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure \n\nby 44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). Therefore, the concomitant use of EXJADE with potent UGT inducers \n\n(e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in \n\nEXJADE efficacy. The patient’s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after the combination, \n\nand the dose of EXJADE adjusted if necessary. \n\n \n\nCholestyramine significantly reduced the deferasirox exposure in a mechanistic study to determine the \n\ndegree of enterohepatic recycling (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nInteraction with midazolam and other agents metabolised by CYP3A4 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox dispersible tablets and \n\nmidazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% \n\nCI: 8% - 26%). In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced. Therefore, due to a \n\npossible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with \n\nsubstances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive \n\nagents, bepridil, ergotamine). \n\n \n\nInteraction with repaglinide and other agents metabolised by CYP2C8 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 \n\ninhibitor (30 mg/kg daily, dispersible tablet formulation), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given \n\nas a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) \n\nand 1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]), respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with \n\ndosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should \n\nbe avoided. If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring \n\nshould be performed (see section 4.4). An interaction between deferasirox and other CYP2C8 \n\nsubstrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nInteraction with theophylline and other agents metabolised by CYP1A2 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a CYP1A2 inhibitor \n\n(repeated dose of 30 mg/kg/day, dispersible tablet formulation) and the CYP1A2 substrate \n\ntheophylline (single dose of 120 mg) resulted in an increase of theophylline AUC by 84% (90% CI: \n\n73% to 95%). The single dose Cmax was not affected, but an increase of theophylline Cmax is expected \n\nto occur with chronic dosing. Therefore, the concomitant use of deferasirox with theophylline is not \n\nrecommended. If deferasirox and theophylline are used concomitantly, monitoring of theophylline \n\nconcentration and theophylline dose reduction should be considered. An interaction between \n\ndeferasirox and other CYP1A2 substrates cannot be excluded. For substances that are predominantly \n\nmetabolised by CYP1A2 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. clozapine, tizanidine), the \n\nsame recommendations apply as for theophylline. \n\n \n\nOther information \n\nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not \n\nbeen formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not \n\nrecommended to take deferasirox tablets with aluminium-containing antacid preparations. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, \n\nsuch as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral \n\nbisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4). The concomitant \n\nadministration of deferasirox with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal \n\nhaemorrhage. Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of deferasirox and busulfan resulted in an increase of busulfan exposure \n\n(AUC), but the mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. If possible, evaluation of the \n\npharmacokinetics (AUC, clearance) of a busulfan test dose should be performed to allow dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox. Studies in animals have shown \n\nsome reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nAs a precaution, it is recommended that EXJADE is not used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nEXJADE may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Women of \n\nchildbearing potential are recommended to use additional or alternative non-hormonal methods of \n\ncontraception when using EXJADE. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIn animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk. No \n\neffect on the offspring was noted. It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk. \n\nBreast-feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo fertility data is available for humans. In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility \n\nwere found (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEXJADE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing the \n\nuncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or operating machines \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment in clinical studies conducted with \n\ndeferasirox dispersible tablets in adult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances \n\n(mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain) and skin rash. Diarrhoea is reported more \n\ncommonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years and in the elderly. These reactions are \n\ndose-dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is \n\ncontinued. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical studies dose-dependent increases in serum creatinine occurred in about 36% of \n\npatients, though most remained within the normal range. Decreases in mean creatinine clearance have \n\nbeen observed in both paediatric and adult patients with beta-thalassemia and iron overload during the \n\nfirst year of treatment, but there is evidence that this does not decrease further in subsequent years of \n\ntreatment. Elevations of liver transaminases have been reported. Safety monitoring schedules for renal \n\nand liver parameters are recommended. Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) \n\ndisturbances are uncommon, and yearly examinations are also recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\nhave been reported with the use of EXJADE (see section 4.4). \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nTable 5 \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Not known: Pancytopenia1, thrombocytopenia1, anaemia aggravated1, \nneutropenia1 \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Not known: Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nangioedema)1 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Not known: Metabolic acidosis1 \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n Uncommon: Anxiety, sleep disorder \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache \n\n Uncommon: Dizziness \n\nEye disorders \n\n Uncommon: Cataract, maculopathy \n\n Rare: Optic neuritis \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\n Uncommon: Deafness \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon: Laryngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, \n\nabdominal distension, dyspepsia \n\n Uncommon: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastric ulcer (including multiple \n\nulcers), duodenal ulcer, gastritis \n\n Rare: Oesophagitis \n\n Not known: Gastrointestinal perforation1, acute pancreatitis1 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Common: Transaminases increased \n\n Uncommon: Hepatitis, cholelithiasis \n\n Not known: Hepatic failure1, 2 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Rash, pruritus \n\n Uncommon: Pigmentation disorder \n\n Rare: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\n Not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome1, hypersensitivity vasculitis1, urticaria1, \n\nerythema multiforme1, alopecia1, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)1 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Very common: Blood creatinine increased \n\n Common: Proteinuria \n\n Uncommon: Renal tubular disorder2 (acquired Fanconi syndrome), glycosuria \n\n Not known: Acute renal failure1, 2, tubulointerstitial nephritis1, nephrolithiasis1, \n\nrenal tubular necrosis1 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Uncommon: Pyrexia, oedema, fatigue \n1 Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience. These are derived from \n\nspontaneous reports for which it is not always possible to reliably establish frequency or a \n\ncausal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product. \n2 Severe forms associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic \n\nencephalopathy have been reported. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nGallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients. Elevations of liver \n\ntransaminases were reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of patients. Elevations of transaminases \n\ngreater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon \n\n(0.3%). During post-marketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with \n\ndeferasirox (see section 4.4). There have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis. The \n\nmajority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi syndrome) or diarrhoea, \n\nor conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication (see section 4.4). Cases of serious \n\nacute pancreatitis were observed without documented underlying biliary conditions. As with other iron \n\nchelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been \n\nuncommonly observed in patients treated with deferasirox (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance in transfusional iron overload \n\nIn a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 adult and paediatric beta-thalassaemia patients with \n\ntransfusional iron overload treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets in two randomised and four \n\nopen label studies of up to five years’ duration, a mean creatinine clearance decrease of 13.2% in adult \n\npatients (95% CI: -14.4% to -12.1%; n=935) and 9.9% (95% CI: -11.1% to -8.6%; n=1,142) in \n\npaediatric patients was observed during the first year of treatment. In 250 patients who were followed \n\nfor up to five years, no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed. \n\n \n\nClinical study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\nIn a 1-year study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron \n\noverload (dispersible tablets at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day), diarrhoea (9.1%), rash (9.1%), and nausea \n\n(7.3%) were the most frequent study drug-related adverse events. Abnormal serum creatinine and \n\ncreatinine clearance values were reported in 5.5% and 1.8% of patients, respectively. Elevations of \n\nliver transaminases greater than 2 times the baseline and 5 times the upper limit of normal were \n\nreported in 1.8% of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \n\nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.4). \n\n \nDiarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients. \n\n \n\nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \n\nwith deferasirox. In post-marketing reports, a high proportion of cases of metabolic acidosis occurred \nin children in the context of Fanconi syndrome. \n\n \n\nAcute pancreatitis has been reported, particularly in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nEarly signs of acute overdose are digestive effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and \n\nvomiting. Hepatic and renal disorders have been reported, including cases of liver enzyme and \n\ncreatinine increased with recovery after treatment discontinuation. An erroneously administered single \n\ndose of 90 mg/kg led to Fanconi syndrome which resolved after treatment. \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for deferasirox. Standard procedures for management of overdose may be \n\nindicated as well as symptomatic treatment, as medically appropriate. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Iron chelating agents, ATC code: V03AC03 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nDeferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III). It is a tridentate ligand that \n\nbinds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the \n\nfaeces. Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels \n\nof these metals. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, deferasirox at daily \n\ndoses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, \n\n0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight/day, respectively. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nClinical efficacy studies were conducted with deferasirox dispersible tablets. \n\n \n\nDeferasirox has been investigated in 411 adult (age 16 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to \n\n<16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions. Of the paediatric patients 52 were \n\naged 2 to 5 years. The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle \n\ncell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], \n\nDiamond-Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias). \n\n \n\nDaily treatment with the deferasirox dispersible tablet formulation at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg for one \n\nyear in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in \n\nindicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/g liver \n\n(biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 \n\nand -926 µg/l on average, respectively. At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake \n\nwere 1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively. \n\nDeferasirox induced similar responses in iron-overloaded patients with other anaemias. Daily doses of \n\n10 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin \n\nlevels and induce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange \n\ntransfusions. Serum ferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron \n\nconcentration indicating that trends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy. \n\nLimited clinical data (29 patients with normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that \n\ntreatment with deferasirox 10-30 mg/kg/day (dispersible tablet formulation) for 1 year may also \n\nreduce levels of iron in the heart (on average, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds). \n\n \n\nThe principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from \n\nbeta-thalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of deferasirox \n\ndispersible tablets to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population. It appeared from a \n\npost-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration ≥7 mg \n\nFe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (20 and 30 mg/kg) or deferoxamine (35 to \n\n≥50 mg/kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved. However, in patients with liver iron \n\nconcentration <7 mg Fe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (5 and 10 mg/kg) or \n\ndeferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of \n\nthe two chelators. This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain \n\non their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose. Fifty-six patients under \n\nthe age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving deferasirox dispersible \n\ntablets. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nIt appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that deferasirox dispersible tablets could be as active \n\nas deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i.e. a dose of deferasirox dispersible tablets that is \n\nnumerically half of the deferoxamine dose). For deferasirox film-coated tablets, a dose ratio of 3:1 can \n\nbe considered (i.e. a dose of deferasirox film-coated tablets that is numerically one third of the \n\ndeferoxamine dose). However, this dosing recommendation was not prospectively assessed in the \n\nclinical studies. \n\n \n\nIn addition, in patients with liver iron concentration ≥7 mg Fe/g dw with various rare anaemias or \n\nsickle cell disease, deferasirox dispersible tablets up to 20 and 30 mg/kg produced a decrease in liver \n\niron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia. \n\n \n\nA placebo-controlled randomised study was performed in 225 patients with MDS (Low/Int-1 risk) and \n\ntransfusional iron overload. The results of this study suggest that there is a positive impact of \n\ndeferasirox on event-free survival (EFS, a composite endpoint including non-fatal cardiac or liver \n\nevents) and serum ferritin levels. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies in adult MDS \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nIn a 5-year observational study in which 267 children aged 2 to <6 years (at enrollment) with \n\ntransfusional haemosiderosis received deferasirox, there were no clinically meaningful differences in \n\nthe safety and tolerability profile of Exjade in paediatric patients aged 2 to <6 years compared to the \n\noverall adult and older paediatric population, including increases in serum creatinine of >33% and \n\nabove the upper limit of normal on ≥2 consecutive occasions (3.1%), and elevation of alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (4.3%). Single events of \n\nincrease in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported in 20.0% and 8.3%, respectively, of the \n\n145 patients who completed the study. \n\n \n\nIn a study to assess the safety of deferasirox film-coated and dispersible tablets, 173 adult and \n\npaediatric patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were treated \n\nfor 24 weeks. A comparable safety profile for film-coated and dispersible tablets was observed. \n\n \n\nIn patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron overload, treatment with \n\ndeferasirox dispersible tablets was assessed in a 1-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\nstudy. The study compared the efficacy of two different deferasirox dispersible tablet regimens \n\n(starting doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, 55 patients in each arm) and of matching placebo (56 patients). \n\nThe study enrolled 145 adult and 21 paediatric patients. The primary efficacy parameter was the \n\nchange in liver iron concentration (LIC) from baseline after 12 months of treatment. One of the \n\nsecondary efficacy parameters was the change in serum ferritin between baseline and fourth quarter. \n\nAt a starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day, deferasirox dispersible tablets led to reductions in indicators of \n\ntotal body iron. On average, liver iron concentration decreased by 3.80 mg Fe/g dw in patients treated \n\nwith deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 0.38 mg Fe/g dw in \n\npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). On average, serum ferritin decreased by 222.0 µg/l in patients \n\ntreated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 115 µg/l in \n\npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nEXJADE film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible \n\ntablet formulation. After adjustment of the strength, the film-coated tablet formulation (360 mg \n\nstrength) was equivalent to EXJADE dispersible tablets (500 mg strength) with respect to the mean \n\narea under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) under fasting conditions. The Cmax was \n\nincreased by 30% (90% CI: 20.3% - 40.0%); however a clinical exposure/response analysis revealed \n\nno evidence of clinically relevant effects of such an increase. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nAbsorption \n\nDeferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is absorbed following oral administration with a median \n\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability \n\n(AUC) of deferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose. \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablet formulation has not been determined. \n\nBioavailability of deferasirox film-coated tablets was 36% greater than that with dispersible tablets. \n\n \n\nA food-effect study involving administration of the film-coated tablets to healthy volunteers under \n\nfasting conditions and with a low-fat (fat content <10% of calories) or high-fat (fat content >50% of \n\ncalories) meal indicated that the AUC and Cmax were slightly decreased after a low-fat meal (by 11% \n\nand 16%, respectively). After a high-fat meal, AUC and Cmax were increased (by 18% and 29%, \n\nrespectively). The increases in Cmax due to the change in formulation and due to the effect of a high-fat \n\nmeal may be additive and therefore, it is recommended that the film-coated tablets should be taken \n\neither on an empty stomach or with a light meal. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nDeferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and \n\nhas a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nGlucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. \n\nDeconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) \n\nis likely to occur: in a healthy volunteer study, the administration of cholestyramine after a single dose \n\nof deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC). \n\n \n\nDeferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalysed \n\n(oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). No inhibition of \n\ndeferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nDeferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose). Renal excretion \n\nof deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose). The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) \n\nranged from 8 to 16 hours. The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary \n\nexcretion of deferasirox. \n\n \n\nLinearity / non-linearity \n\nThe Cmax and AUC0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state \n\nconditions. Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nThe overall exposure of adolescents (12 to ≤17 years) and children (2 to <12 years) to deferasirox after \n\nsingle and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients. In children younger than 6 years old \n\nexposure was about 50% lower than in adults. Since dosing is individually adjusted according to \n\nresponse this is not expected to have clinical consequences. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nFemales have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males. \n\nSince dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical \n\nconsequences. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The \n\npharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the \n\nupper limit of the normal range. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical study using single doses of 20 mg/kg deferasirox dispersible tablets, the average exposure \n\nwas increased by 16% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and by 76% in \n\nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) compared to subjects with normal \n\nhepatic function. The average Cmax of deferasirox in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment was increased by 22%. Exposure was increased 2.8-fold in one subject with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. The main findings were \n\nkidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts). Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile \n\nanimals. The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not \n\npreviously overloaded with iron. \n\n \n\nTests of genotoxicity in vitro were negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) while \n\ndeferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of \n\nnon-iron-loaded rats at lethal doses. No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats. Deferasirox \n\nwas not carcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/- heterozygous \n\nmice in a 6-month study. \n\n \n\nThe potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits. Deferasirox was not \n\nteratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high \n\ndoses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother. Deferasirox did not cause other \n\neffects on fertility or reproduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions \n\n(7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and \n\nolder. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when \n\ndeferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: \n\n- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood \n\ntransfusions (7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to \n\ninfrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and \n\nolder, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. \n \n\nEXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when \n\ndeferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with EXJADE should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the \n\ntreatment of chronic iron overload. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTransfusional iron overload \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about \n\n100 ml/kg) of packed red blood cells (PRBC) or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that \n\nchronic iron overload is present (e.g. serum ferritin >1,000 µg/l). Doses (in mg/kg) must be calculated \n\nand rounded to the nearest whole sachet size. \n\n \n\nThe goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, \n\nas required, to reduce the existing iron burden. \n\n \n\nCaution should be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEXJADE granules demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible tablet \n\nformulation (see section 5.2). In case of switching from dispersible tablets to granules, the dose of the \n\ngranules should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible tablets, rounded to the nearest whole \n\nsachet. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding doses for the different formulations are shown in the table below. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nTable 1 Recommended doses for transfusional iron overload \n\n \n\n Film-coated \n\ntablets/granules \n\nDispersible tablets Transfusions  Serum \n\nferritin \n\nStarting dose 14 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day After 20 units \n\n(about 100 ml/kg) \n\nof PRBC \n\nor >1,000 µg/l \n\nAlternative \n\nstarting doses \n\n21 mg/kg/day 30 mg/kg/day >14 ml/kg/month \n\nof PRBC (approx. \n\n>4 units/month \n\nfor an adult) \n\n  \n\n 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day <7 ml/kg/month \n\nof PRBC (approx. \n\n<2 units/month \n\nfor an adult) \n\n  \n\nFor patients \n\nwell managed \n\non \n\ndeferoxamine \n\nOne third of \n\ndeferoxamine dose \n\nHalf of \n\ndeferoxamine dose \n\n   \n\nMonitoring     Monthly \n\nTarget range     500-1,000 µg/l \n\n      \n\nAdjustment \n\nsteps \n(every \n\n3-6 months) \n\nIncrease   >2,500 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day \n\nUp to 28 mg/kg/day \n\n5-10 mg/kg/day \n\nUp to 40 mg/kg/day \n\n   \n\nDecrease    \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day   <2,500 µg/l \n\nIn patients treated \n\nwith doses \n\n>21 mg/kg/day \n\nIn patients treated \n\nwith doses \n\n>30 mg/kg/day \n\n   \n\n- When target is reached   500-1,000 µg/l \n\nMaximum \n\ndose \n\n28 mg/kg/day 40 mg/kg/day    \n\nConsider \n\ninterruption \n\n    <500 µg/l \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE granules is 14 mg/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nAn initial daily dose of 21 mg/kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated \n\nbody iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n\n(approximately >4 units/month for an adult). \n\n \n\nAn initial daily dose of 7 mg/kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body \n\niron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n\n(approximately <2 units/month for an adult). The patient’s response must be monitored and a dose \n\nincrease should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nFor patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE \n\ngranules that is numerically one third that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e.g. a patient \n\nreceiving 40 mg/kg/day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be transferred to a \n\nstarting daily dose of 14 mg/kg/day of EXJADE granules). When this results in a daily dose less than \n\n14 mg/kg body weight, the patient’s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be \n\nconsidered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of EXJADE be \n\nadjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin. Dose adjustments \n\nmay be made in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient’s response and \n\ntherapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden). In patients not adequately controlled with \n\ndoses of 21 mg/kg (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 µg/l and not showing a \n\ndecreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg/kg may be considered. The availability of long-term \n\nefficacy and safety data from clinical studies conducted with EXJADE dispersible tablets used at \n\ndoses above 30 mg/kg is currently limited (264 patients followed for an average of 1 year after dose \n\nescalation). If only very poor haemosiderosis control is achieved at doses up to 21 mg/kg, a further \n\nincrease (to a maximum of 28 mg/kg) may not achieve satisfactory control, and alternative treatment \n\noptions may be considered. If no satisfactory control is achieved at doses above 21 mg/kg, treatment at \n\nsuch doses should not be maintained and alternative treatment options should be considered whenever \n\npossible. Doses above 28 mg/kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with \n\ndoses above this level (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with doses greater than 21 mg/kg, dose reductions in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should \n\nbe considered when control has been achieved (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently below 2,500 µg/l \n\nand showing a decreasing trend over time). In patients whose serum ferritin level has reached the \n\ntarget (usually between 500 and 1,000 µg/l), dose reductions in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should be \n\nconsidered to maintain serum ferritin levels within the target range and to minimise the risk of \n\noverchelation. If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/l, an interruption of treatment should \n\nbe considered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\n \n\nChelation therapy should only be initiated when there is evidence of iron overload (liver iron \n\nconcentration [LIC] ≥5 mg Fe/g dry weight [dw] or serum ferritin consistently >800 µg/l). LIC is the \n\npreferred method of iron overload determination and should be used wherever available. Caution \n\nshould be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nEXJADE granules demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible tablet \n\nformulation (see section 5.2). In case of switching from dispersible tablets to granules, the dose of the \n\ngranules should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible tablets, rounded to the nearest whole \n\nsachet. \n\n \n\nThe corresponding doses for the different formulations are shown in the table below. \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nTable 2 Recommended doses for non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\n \n\n Film-coated \n\ntablets/granules \n\nDispersible \n\ntablets \n\nLiver iron \n\nconcentration \n\n(LIC)* \n\n Serum \n\nferritin \n\nStarting dose 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day ≥5 mg Fe/g dw or >800 µg/l \n\nMonitoring     Monthly \n\nAdjustment \n\nsteps \n(every \n\n3-6 months) \n\nIncrease ≥7 mg Fe/g dw or >2,000 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day    \n\nDecrease <7 mg Fe/g dw or ≤2,000 µg/l \n\n3.5 - 7 mg/kg/day 5-10 mg/kg/day    \n\nMaximum \n\ndose \n\n14 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day    \n\n 7 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day    \n\n For adults not assessed and ≤2,000 µg/l \n For paediatric patients    \n\nInterruption   <3 mg Fe/g dw or <300 µg/l \n\nRetreatment   Not recommended \n\n*LIC is the preferred method of iron overload determination. \n\n \n\nStarting dose \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE granules in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes is 7 mg/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month to assess the patient’s response to \n\ntherapy and to minimise the risk of overchelation (see section 4.4). After every 3 to 6 months of \n\ntreatment, a dose increase in increments of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should be considered if the patient’s LIC is \n\n≥7 mg Fe/g dw, or if serum ferritin is consistently >2,000 µg/l and not showing a downward trend, and \n\nthe patient is tolerating the medicinal product well. Doses above 14 mg/kg are not recommended \n\nbecause there is no experience with doses above this level in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes. \n\n \n\nIn patients in whom LIC was not assessed and serum ferritin is ≤2,000 µg/l, dosing should not exceed \n\n7 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nFor patients in whom the dose was increased to >7 mg/kg, dose reduction to 7 mg/kg or less is \n\nrecommended when LIC is <7 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin is ≤2,000 µg/l. \n\n \n\nTreatment cessation \n\nOnce a satisfactory body iron level has been achieved (LIC <3 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin \n\n<300 µg/l), treatment should be stopped. There are no data available on the retreatment of patients \n\nwho reaccumulate iron after having achieved a satisfactory body iron level and therefore retreatment \n\ncannot be recommended. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥65 years of age) \n\nThe dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above. In clinical studies, \n\nelderly patients experienced a higher frequency of adverse reactions than younger patients (in \n\nparticular, diarrhoea) and should be monitored closely for adverse reactions that may require a dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTransfusional iron overload: \n\nThe dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years with transfusional iron \n\noverload are the same as for adult patients (see section 4.2). It is recommended that serum ferritin be \n\nmonitored every month to assess the patient’s response to therapy and to minimise the risk of \n\noverchelation (see section 4.4). Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into \n\naccount when calculating the dose. \n\n \n\nIn children with transfusional iron overload aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in \n\nadults (see section 5.2). This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in \n\nadults. However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration. \n\n \n\nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes: \n\nIn paediatric patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, dosing should not \n\nexceed 7 mg/kg. In these patients, closer monitoring of LIC and serum ferritin is essential to avoid \n\noverchelation (see section 4.4). In addition to monthly serum ferritin assessments, LIC should be \n\nmonitored every three months when serum ferritin is ≤800 µg/l. \n\n \n\nChildren from birth to 23 months: \n\nThe safety and efficacy of EXJADE in children from birth to 23 months of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nEXJADE has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with \n\nestimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nEXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In \n\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the dose should be considerably \n\nreduced followed by progressive increase up to a limit of 50% (see sections 4.4 and 5.2), and EXJADE \n\nmust be used with caution in such patients. Hepatic function in all patients should be monitored before \n\ntreatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and then every month (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor oral use. \n\n \n\nThe granules should be administered by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food, e.g. yogurt or apple \n\nsauce (pureed apple). The dose should be immediately and completely consumed, and not stored for \n\nfuture use. \n \n\nThe soft food containing the granules should be taken with or without a light meal, once a day, \npreferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nCombination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been \n\nestablished (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients with estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nDeferasirox has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the \n\nage-appropriate normal range. \n\n \nDuring clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine of >33% on ≥2 consecutive occasions, \n\nsometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients. These were \n\ndose-dependent. About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below \n\nthe 33% level without dose adjustment. In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not \n\nalways respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption. In some cases, only a stabilisation of the \n\nserum creatinine values has been observed after dose reduction. Cases of acute renal failure have been \n\nreported following post-marketing use of deferasirox (see section 4.8). In some post-marketing cases, \n\nrenal function deterioration has led to renal failure requiring temporary or permanent dialysis. \n\n \n\nThe causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated. Particular attention should \n\ntherefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving \n\nmedicinal products that depress renal function, and in patients who are receiving high doses of \n\ndeferasirox and/or low rates of transfusion (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells or \n\n<2 units/month for an adult). While no increase in renal adverse events was observed after dose \n\nescalation of EXJADE dispersible tablets to doses above 30 mg/kg in clinical studies, an increased risk \n\nof renal adverse events with granule doses above 21 mg/kg cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy. Serum \n\ncreatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and \n\nwith the Schwartz formula in children) and/or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored prior to \n\ntherapy, weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE \n\n(including switch of formulation), and monthly thereafter. Patients with pre-existing renal \n\nconditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more \n\nat risk of complications. Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop \n\ndiarrhoea or vomiting. \n\n \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis occurring during treatment with \n\ndeferasirox. The majority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi \n\nsyndrome) or diarrhoea, or conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication. Acid-base \n\nbalance should be monitored as clinically indicated in these populations. Interruption of EXJADE \n\ntherapy should be considered in patients who develop metabolic acidosis. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing cases of severe forms of renal tubulopathy (such as Fanconi syndrome) and renal \n\nfailure associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy \n\nhave been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, mainly in children. It is recommended that \n\nhyperammonaemic encephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who \n\ndevelop unexplained changes in mental status while on Exjade therapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nTable 3 Dose adjustment and interruption of treatment for renal monitoring \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances. \n\n \n\nDose reduction or interruption may be also considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of \n\nrenal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated: \n\n• Proteinuria (test should be performed prior to therapy and monthly thereafter) \n\n• Glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria (monitor as needed). \n\nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \n\nwith EXJADE. \n\n \n\nPatients should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal \n\nbiopsy) may be considered if the following occur despite dose reduction and interruption: \n\n• Serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and \n\n• Persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e.g. proteinuria, Fanconi Syndrome). \n\n \n\nHepatic function \n \n\nLiver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with deferasirox. Post-marketing \n\ncases of hepatic failure, some of which were fatal, have been reported. Severe forms associated with \n\nchanges in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, may occur in patients \n\ntreated with deferasirox, particularly in children. It is recommended that hyperammonaemic \n\nencephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who develop unexplained \n\nchanges in mental status while on Exjade therapy. Care should be taken to maintain adequate \n\nhydration in patients who experience volume-depleting events (such as diarrhoea or vomiting), \n\nparticularly in children with acute illness. Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with \n\nsignificant comorbidities including pre-existing chronic liver conditions (including cirrhosis and \n\nhepatitis C) and multi-organ failure. The role of deferasirox as a contributing or aggravating factor \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n Serum creatinine  Creatinine clearance \n\nBefore initiation of \n\ntherapy \n\nTwice (2x) and Once (1x) \n\nContraindicated   <60 ml/min \n\nMonitoring    \n\n- First month after \n\nstart of therapy or \n\ndose modification \n\n(including switch \n\nof formulation) \n\nWeekly and Weekly \n\n- Thereafter Monthly and Monthly \n\nReduction of daily dose by 7 mg/kg/day (film-coated tablet formulation), \n\nif following renal parameters are observed at two consecutive visits and cannot be attributed to \n\nother causes \n\nAdult patients >33% above pre-\n\ntreatment average \n\nand Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\nPaediatric patients > age appropriate \n\nULN**  \n\nand/or Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\nAfter dose reduction, interrupt treatment, if \n\nAdult and paediatric Remains >33% above \n\npre-treatment average \n\nand/or Decreases <LLN* \n\n(<90 ml/min) \n\n*LLN: lower limit of the normal range \n\n**ULN: upper limit of the normal range \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nIt is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the \n\ninitiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter. If there is a \n\npersistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other \n\ncauses, EXJADE should be interrupted. Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has \n\nbeen clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose \n\nfollowed by gradual dose escalation may be considered. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Summary of safety monitoring recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn patients with a short life expectancy (e.g. high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes), especially when \n\nco-morbidities could increase the risk of adverse events, the benefit of EXJADE might be limited and \n\nmay be inferior to risks. As a consequence, treatment with EXJADE is not recommended in these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nCaution should be used in elderly patients due to a higher frequency of adverse reactions (in particular, \n\ndiarrhoea). \n\n \n\nData in children with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia are very limited (see section 5.1). As a \n\nconsequence, EXJADE therapy should be closely monitored to detect adverse reactions and to follow \n\niron burden in the paediatric population. In addition, before treating heavily iron-overloaded children \n\nwith non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia with EXJADE, the physician should be aware that the \n\nconsequences of long-term exposure in such patients are currently not known. \n\n \n\nTest Frequency \n\nSerum creatinine In duplicate prior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \n\nafter dose modification (including switch \n\nof formulation). \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nCreatinine clearance and/or plasma \n\ncystatin C \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \n\nafter dose modification (including switch \n\nof formulation). \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nProteinuria Prior to therapy. \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nOther markers of renal tubular function \n\n(such as glycosuria in non-diabetics and \n\nlow levels of serum potassium, \n\nphosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria) \n\nAs needed. \n\nSerum transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline \n\nphosphatase \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nEvery 2 weeks during first month of \n\ntherapy. \n\nMonthly thereafter. \n\nAuditory and ophthalmic testing Prior to therapy. \n\nAnnually thereafter. \n\nBody weight, height and sexual \n\ndevelopment \n\nPrior to therapy. \n\nAnnually in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nUpper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children \n\nand adolescents, receiving deferasirox. Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see \n\nsection 4.8). There have been reports of ulcers complicated with digestive perforation. Also, there \n\nhave been reports of fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhages, especially in elderly patients who had \n\nhaematological malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Physicians and patients should remain alert \n\nfor signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during EXJADE therapy. In \n\ncase of gastrointestinal ulceration or haemorrhage, EXJADE should be discontinued and additional \n\nevaluation and treatment must be promptly initiated. Caution should be exercised in patients who are \n\ntaking EXJADE in combination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as \n\nNSAIDs, corticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates, in patients receiving anticoagulants and in patients \n\nwith platelet counts below 50,000/mm3 (50 x 109/l) (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSkin disorders \n\nSkin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment. The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases. \n\nWhen interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of \n\nthe rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation. In severe cases this reintroduction could \n\nbe conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration. Severe cutaneous \n\nadverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which could be \n\nlife-threatening or fatal, have been reported. If any SCAR is suspected, EXJADE should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and should not be reintroduced. At the time of prescription, patients should \n\nbe advised of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nCases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported \n\nin patients receiving deferasirox, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases \n\nwithin the first month of treatment (see section 4.8). If such reactions occur, EXJADE should be \n\ndiscontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted. Deferasirox should not be reintroduced \n\nin patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction due to the risk of anaphylactic shock (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nVision and hearing \n\nAuditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see section \n\n4.8). Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the start of \n\ntreatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months). If disturbances are noted during the \n\ntreatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered. \n\n \n\nBlood disorders \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia (or \n\naggravation of these cytopenias) and of aggravated anaemia in patients treated with deferasirox. Most \n\nof these patients had pre-existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone \n\nmarrow failure. However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded. Interruption of \n\ntreatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia. \n\n \n\nOther considerations \n\nMonthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient’s response to \n\ntherapy and to avoid overchelation (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and \n\nhepatic function, and serum ferritin levels are recommended during periods of treatments with high \n\ndoses and when serum ferritin levels are close to the target range. If serum ferritin falls consistently \n\nbelow 500 µg/l (in transfusional iron overload) or below 300 µg/l (in non-transfusion-dependent \n\nthalassaemia syndromes), an interruption of treatment should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should be \n\nrecorded and regularly assessed for trends. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \n\nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.8). However, as a general precautionary measure in \n\nthe management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and \n\nsexual development should be monitored prior to therapy and at regular intervals (every 12 months). \n\n \n\nCardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload. Cardiac function should be \n\nmonitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with EXJADE. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThe safety of deferasirox in combination with other iron chelators has not been established. Therefore, \n\nit must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nInteraction with food \n\nThere were no clinically relevant changes in deferasirox pharmacokinetics when EXJADE granules \n\nwere administered with food. Although there was no significant effect (increase in the extent of \n\nabsorption AUC by 18-19%; no change in Cmax) of a high-fat meal on deferasirox pharmacokinetics, it \n\nis recommended that deferasirox granules be taken either with or without a light meal (see section \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\nAgents that may decrease EXJADE systemic exposure \n\nDeferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes. In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant \n\nadministration of deferasirox (single dose of 30 mg/kg, dispersible tablet formulation) and the potent \n\nUGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure \n\nby 44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). Therefore, the concomitant use of EXJADE with potent UGT inducers \n\n(e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in \n\nEXJADE efficacy. The patient’s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after the combination, \n\nand the dose of EXJADE adjusted if necessary. \n\n \n\nCholestyramine significantly reduced the deferasirox exposure in a mechanistic study to determine the \n\ndegree of enterohepatic recycling (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nInteraction with midazolam and other agents metabolised by CYP3A4 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox dispersible tablets and \n\nmidazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% \n\nCI: 8% - 26%). In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced. Therefore, due to a \n\npossible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with \n\nsubstances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive \n\nagents, bepridil, ergotamine). \n\n \n\nInteraction with repaglinide and other agents metabolised by CYP2C8 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 \n\ninhibitor (30 mg/kg daily, dispersible tablet formulation), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given \n\nas a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) \n\nand 1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]), respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with \n\ndosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should \n\nbe avoided. If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring \n\nshould be performed (see section 4.4). An interaction between deferasirox and other CYP2C8 \n\nsubstrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nInteraction with theophylline and other agents metabolised by CYP1A2 \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a CYP1A2 inhibitor \n\n(repeated dose of 30 mg/kg/day, dispersible tablet formulation) and the CYP1A2 substrate \n\ntheophylline (single dose of 120 mg) resulted in an increase of theophylline AUC by 84% (90% CI: \n\n73% to 95%). The single dose Cmax was not affected, but an increase of theophylline Cmax is expected \n\nto occur with chronic dosing. Therefore, the concomitant use of deferasirox with theophylline is not \n\nrecommended. If deferasirox and theophylline are used concomitantly, monitoring of theophylline \n\nconcentration and theophylline dose reduction should be considered. An interaction between \n\ndeferasirox and other CYP1A2 substrates cannot be excluded. For substances that are predominantly \n\nmetabolised by CYP1A2 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. clozapine, tizanidine), the \n\nsame recommendations apply as for theophylline. \n\n \n\nOther information \n\nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not \n\nbeen formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not \n\nrecommended to take deferasirox granules with aluminium-containing antacid preparations. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, \n\nsuch as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral \n\nbisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4). The concomitant \n\nadministration of deferasirox with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal \n\nhaemorrhage. Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these \n\nsubstances. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of deferasirox and busulfan resulted in an increase of busulfan exposure \n\n(AUC), but the mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. If possible, evaluation of the \n\npharmacokinetics (AUC, clearance) of a busulfan test dose should be performed to allow dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox. Studies in animals have shown \n\nsome reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nAs a precaution, it is recommended that EXJADE is not used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nEXJADE may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Women of \n\nchildbearing potential are recommended to use additional or alternative non-hormonal methods of \n\ncontraception when using EXJADE. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIn animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk. No \n\neffect on the offspring was noted. It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk. \n\nBreast-feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo fertility data is available for humans. In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility \n\nwere found (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEXJADE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing the \n\nuncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or operating machines \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment in clinical studies conducted with \n\ndeferasirox dispersible tablets in adult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances \n\n(mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain) and skin rash. Diarrhoea is reported more \n\ncommonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years and in the elderly. These reactions are \n\ndose-dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is \n\ncontinued. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical studies dose-dependent increases in serum creatinine occurred in about 36% of \n\npatients, though most remained within the normal range. Decreases in mean creatinine clearance have \n\nbeen observed in both paediatric and adult patients with beta-thalassemia and iron overload during the \n\nfirst year of treatment, but there is evidence that this does not decrease further in subsequent years of \n\ntreatment. Elevations of liver transaminases have been reported. Safety monitoring schedules for renal \n\nand liver parameters are recommended. Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) \n\ndisturbances are uncommon, and yearly examinations are also recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\nhave been reported with the use of EXJADE (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nTable 5 \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Not known: Pancytopenia1, thrombocytopenia1, anaemia aggravated1, \nneutropenia1 \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Not known: Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nangioedema)1 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Not known: Metabolic acidosis1 \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n Uncommon: Anxiety, sleep disorder \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache \n\n Uncommon: Dizziness \n\nEye disorders \n\n Uncommon: Cataract, maculopathy \n\n Rare: Optic neuritis \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\n Uncommon: Deafness \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon: Laryngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, \n\nabdominal distension, dyspepsia \n\n Uncommon: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastric ulcer (including multiple \n\nulcers), duodenal ulcer, gastritis \n\n Rare: Oesophagitis \n\n Not known: Gastrointestinal perforation1, acute pancreatitis1 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Common: Transaminases increased \n\n Uncommon: Hepatitis, cholelithiasis \n\n Not known: Hepatic failure1, 2 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Rash, pruritus \n\n Uncommon: Pigmentation disorder \n\n Rare: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\n Not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome1, hypersensitivity vasculitis1, urticaria1, \n\nerythema multiforme1, alopecia1, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)1 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Very common: Blood creatinine increased \n\n Common: Proteinuria \n\n Uncommon: Renal tubular disorder2 (acquired Fanconi syndrome), glycosuria \n\n Not known: Acute renal failure1, 2, tubulointerstitial nephritis1, nephrolithiasis1, \n\nrenal tubular necrosis1 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Uncommon: Pyrexia, oedema, fatigue \n1 Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience. These are derived from \n\nspontaneous reports for which it is not always possible to reliably establish frequency or a \n\ncausal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product. \n2 Severe forms associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic \n\nencephalopathy have been reported. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nGallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients. Elevations of liver \n\ntransaminases were reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of patients. Elevations of transaminases \n\ngreater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon \n\n(0.3%). During post-marketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with \n\ndeferasirox (see section 4.4). There have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis. The \n\nmajority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi syndrome) or diarrhoea, \n\nor conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication (see section 4.4). Cases of serious \n\nacute pancreatitis were observed without documented underlying biliary conditions. As with other iron \n\nchelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been \n\nuncommonly observed in patients treated with deferasirox (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance in transfusional iron overload \n\nIn a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 adult and paediatric beta-thalassaemia patients with \n\ntransfusional iron overload treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets in two randomised and four \n\nopen label studies of up to five years’ duration, a mean creatinine clearance decrease of 13.2% in adult \n\npatients (95% CI: -14.4% to -12.1%; n=935) and 9.9% (95% CI: -11.1% to -8.6%; n=1,142) in \n\npaediatric patients was observed during the first year of treatment. In 250 patients who were followed \n\nfor up to five years, no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed. \n\n \n\nClinical study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n\nIn a 1-year study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron \n\noverload (dispersible tablets at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day), diarrhoea (9.1%), rash (9.1%), and nausea \n\n(7.3%) were the most frequent study drug-related adverse events. Abnormal serum creatinine and \n\ncreatinine clearance values were reported in 5.5% and 1.8% of patients, respectively. Elevations of \n\nliver transaminases greater than 2 times the baseline and 5 times the upper limit of normal were \n\nreported in 1.8% of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \n\nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.4). \n\n \nDiarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients. \n\n \n\nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \n\nwith deferasirox. In post-marketing reports, a high proportion of cases of metabolic acidosis occurred \nin children in the context of Fanconi syndrome. \n\n \n\nAcute pancreatitis has been reported, particularly in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nEarly signs of acute overdose are digestive effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and \n\nvomiting. Hepatic and renal disorders have been reported, including cases of liver enzyme and \n\ncreatinine increased with recovery after treatment discontinuation. An erroneously administered single \n\ndose of 90 mg/kg led to Fanconi syndrome which resolved after treatment. \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for deferasirox. Standard procedures for management of overdose may be \n\nindicated as well as symptomatic treatment, as medically appropriate. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Iron chelating agents, ATC code: V03AC03 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nDeferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III). It is a tridentate ligand that \n\nbinds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the \n\nfaeces. Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels \n\nof these metals. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, deferasirox at daily \n\ndoses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, \n\n0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight/day, respectively. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nClinical efficacy studies were conducted with deferasirox dispersible tablets. \n\n \n\nDeferasirox has been investigated in 411 adult (age 16 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to \n\n<16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions. Of the paediatric patients 52 were \n\naged 2 to 5 years. The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle \n\ncell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], \n\nDiamond-Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias). \n\n \n\nDaily treatment with the deferasirox dispersible tablet formulation at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg for one \n\nyear in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in \n\nindicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/g liver \n\n(biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 \n\nand -926 µg/l on average, respectively. At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake \n\nwere 1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively. \n\nDeferasirox induced similar responses in iron-overloaded patients with other anaemias. Daily doses of \n\n10 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin \n\nlevels and induce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange \n\ntransfusions. Serum ferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron \n\nconcentration indicating that trends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy. \n\nLimited clinical data (29 patients with normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that \n\ntreatment with deferasirox 10-30 mg/kg/day (dispersible tablet formulation) for 1 year may also \n\nreduce levels of iron in the heart (on average, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds). \n\n \n\nThe principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from \n\nbeta-thalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of deferasirox \n\ndispersible tablets to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population. It appeared from a \n\npost-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration ≥7 mg \n\nFe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (20 and 30 mg/kg) or deferoxamine (35 to \n\n≥50 mg/kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved. However, in patients with liver iron \n\nconcentration <7 mg Fe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (5 and 10 mg/kg) or \n\ndeferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of \n\nthe two chelators. This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain \n\non their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose. Fifty-six patients under \n\nthe age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving deferasirox dispersible \n\ntablets. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nIt appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that deferasirox dispersible tablets could be as active \n\nas deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i.e. a dose of deferasirox dispersible tablets that is \n\nnumerically half of the deferoxamine dose). For deferasirox granules, a dose ratio of 3:1 can be \n\nconsidered (i.e. a dose of deferasirox granules that is numerically one third of the deferoxamine dose). \n\nHowever, this dosing recommendation was not prospectively assessed in the clinical studies. \n\n \n\nIn addition, in patients with liver iron concentration ≥7 mg Fe/g dw with various rare anaemias or \n\nsickle cell disease, deferasirox dispersible tablets up to 20 and 30 mg/kg produced a decrease in liver \n\niron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia. \n\n \n\nA placebo-controlled randomised study was performed in 225 patients with MDS (Low/Int-1 risk) and \n\ntransfusional iron overload. The results of this study suggest that there is a positive impact of \n\ndeferasirox on event-free survival (EFS, a composite endpoint including non-fatal cardiac or liver \n\nevents) and serum ferritin levels. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies in adult MDS \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nIn a 5-year observational study in which 267 children aged 2 to <6 years (at enrollment) with \n\ntransfusional haemosiderosis received deferasirox, there were no clinically meaningful differences in \n\nthe safety and tolerability profile of Exjade in paediatric patients aged 2 to <6 years compared to the \n\noverall adult and older paediatric population, including increases in serum creatinine of >33% and \n\nabove the upper limit of normal on ≥2 consecutive occasions (3.1%), and elevation of alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (4.3%). Single events of \n\nincrease in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported in 20.0% and 8.3%, respectively, of the \n\n145 patients who completed the study. \n\n \n\nIn a study to assess the safety of deferasirox film-coated and dispersible tablets, 173 adult and \n\npaediatric patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were treated \n\nfor 24 weeks. A comparable safety profile for film-coated and dispersible tablets was observed. \n\n \n\nIn patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron overload, treatment with \n\ndeferasirox dispersible tablets was assessed in a 1-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\nstudy. The study compared the efficacy of two different deferasirox dispersible tablet regimens \n\n(starting doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, 55 patients in each arm) and of matching placebo (56 patients). \n\nThe study enrolled 145 adult and 21 paediatric patients. The primary efficacy parameter was the \n\nchange in liver iron concentration (LIC) from baseline after 12 months of treatment. One of the \n\nsecondary efficacy parameters was the change in serum ferritin between baseline and fourth quarter. \n\nAt a starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day, deferasirox dispersible tablets led to reductions in indicators of \n\ntotal body iron. On average, liver iron concentration decreased by 3.80 mg Fe/g dw in patients treated \n\nwith deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 0.38 mg Fe/g dw in \n\npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). On average, serum ferritin decreased by 222.0 µg/l in patients \n\ntreated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 115 µg/l in \n\npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nEXJADE granules demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible tablet \n\nformulation. After adjustment of the strength, the granules formulation (4 x 90 mg strength) was \n\nequivalent to EXJADE dispersible tablets (500 mg strength) with respect to the mean area under the \n\nplasma concentration time curve (AUC) under fasting conditions. The Cmax was increased by 34% \n\n(90% CI: 27.9% - 40.3%); however a clinical exposure/response analysis revealed no evidence of \n\nclinically relevant effects of such an increase. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nAbsorption \n\nDeferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is absorbed following oral administration with a median \n\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability \n\n(AUC) of deferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose. \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of the granule formulation has not been determined. Bioavailability of \n\ndeferasirox granules was 52% greater than that with dispersible tablets. \n\n \n\nA food-effect study involving administration of the granules to healthy volunteers under fasting \n\nconditions and with a low-fat (fat content = approximately 30% of calories) or high-fat (fat content \n\n>50% of calories) meal indicated that the AUC and Cmax were slightly decreased after a low-fat meal \n\n(by 10% and 11%, respectively). After a high-fat meal, only AUC was mildly increased (by 18%). \n\nWhen the granules were administered with apple sauce or yogurt, a food effect was absent. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nDeferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and \n\nhas a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nGlucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. \n\nDeconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) \n\nis likely to occur: in a healthy volunteer study, the administration of cholestyramine after a single dose \n\nof deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC). \n\n \n\nDeferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalysed \n\n(oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). No inhibition of \n\ndeferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nDeferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose). Renal excretion \n\nof deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose). The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) \n\nranged from 8 to 16 hours. The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary \n\nexcretion of deferasirox. \n\n \n\nLinearity / non-linearity \n\nThe Cmax and AUC0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state \n\nconditions. Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nThe overall exposure of adolescents (12 to ≤17 years) and children (2 to <12 years) to deferasirox after \n\nsingle and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients. In children younger than 6 years old \n\nexposure was about 50% lower than in adults. Since dosing is individually adjusted according to \n\nresponse this is not expected to have clinical consequences. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nFemales have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males. \n\nSince dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical \n\nconsequences. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older). \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The \n\npharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the \n\nupper limit of the normal range. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nIn a clinical study using single doses of 20 mg/kg deferasirox dispersible tablets, the average exposure \n\nwas increased by 16% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and by 76% in \n\nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) compared to subjects with normal \n\nhepatic function. The average Cmax of deferasirox in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment was increased by 22%. Exposure was increased 2.8-fold in one subject with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. The main findings were \n\nkidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts). Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile \n\nanimals. The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not \n\npreviously overloaded with iron. \n\n \n\nTests of genotoxicity in vitro were negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) while \n\ndeferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of \n\nnon-iron-loaded rats at lethal doses. No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats. Deferasirox \n\nwas not carcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/- heterozygous \n\nmice in a 6-month study. \n\n \n\nThe potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits. Deferasirox was not \n\nteratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high \n\ndoses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother. Deferasirox did not cause other \n\neffects on fertility or reproduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed only for you or your child. Do not pass it on to others.

What EXJADE is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat EXJADE is \n\nEXJADE contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a medicine \n\nused to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and removes excess \n\niron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. \n\n \n\nWhat EXJADE is used for \n\nRepeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example \n\nthalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood \n\ntransfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body \n\ndoes not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In \n\npatients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over \n\ntime, mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over \n\ntime, the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron \n\nchelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with \n\nbeta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or \n\ninadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by infrequent blood \n\ntransfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 5 years. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat patients \n\naged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, but who \n\nare not transfusion dependent. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take EXJADE \n \n\nDo not take EXJADE \n- if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking EXJADE. If you think you \n\nmay be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. \n- if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. \n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended \n\n- if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of \nblood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EXJADE: \n\n- if you have a kidney or liver problem. \n\n- if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. \n\n- if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). \n\n- if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face \n\nand throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n- if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of \n\nthe lips, eyes, or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes \n\n(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n- if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or \n\nincreased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). \n\n- if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less \n\nalert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your \n\nblood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4 “Possible side \n\neffects”). \n\n- if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. \n\n- if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking EXJADE. \n\n- if you experience frequent heartburn. \n\n- if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. \n\n- if you have blurred vision. \n\n- if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nMonitoring your EXJADE treatment \n\nYou will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in \n\nyour body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well EXJADE is working. The tests will also monitor \n\nyour kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver function \n\n(blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if he/she \n\nsuspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests to \n\ndetermine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration when \n\ndeciding on the dose of EXJADE most suitable for you and will also use these tests to decide when \n\nyou should stop taking EXJADE. \n\n \n\nYour eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\nOther medicines and EXJADE \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- other iron chelators, which must not be taken with EXJADE, \n\n- antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium, which should not be taken at \n\nthe same time of day as EXJADE, \n\n- ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such \n\nas rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol), \n\n- certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids), \n\n- oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), \n\n- anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent or treat blood clotting), \n\n- hormonal contraceptive agents (birth control medicines), \n\n- bepridil, ergotamine (used for heart problems and migraines), \n\n- repaglinide (used to treat diabetes), \n\n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), \n\n- ritonavir (used in the treatment of HIV infection), \n\n- paclitaxel (used in cancer treatment), \n\n- theophylline (used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma), \n\n- clozapine (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia), \n\n- tizanidine (used as a muscle relaxant), \n\n- cholestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood), \n\n- busulfan (used as a treatment prior to transplantation in order to destroy the original bone \n\nmarrow before the transplant). \n\n \n\nAdditional tests may be required to monitor the blood levels of some of these medicines. \n\n \n\nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \nEXJADE can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. Elderly \n\npatients may experience more side effects (in particular diarrhoea) than younger patients. They should \n\nbe monitored closely by their doctor for side effects that may require a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nEXJADE can be used in children and adolescents receiving regular blood transfusions aged 2 years \n\nand over and in children and adolescents not receiving regular blood transfusions aged 10 years and \n\nover. As the patient grows the doctor will adjust the dose. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended for children aged under 2 years. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nIf you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, \n\nyou should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom), as EXJADE may reduce \n\nthe effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EXJADE. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy after taking EXJADE, do not drive or operate any tools or machines until you are \n\nfeeling normal again. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n\nEXJADE contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take EXJADE \n \n\nTreatment with EXJADE will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of iron \n\noverload caused by blood transfusions. \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much EXJADE to take \n\nThe dose of EXJADE is related to body weight for all patients. Your doctor will calculate the dose you \n\nneed and tell you how many tablets to take each day. \n\n The usual daily dose for EXJADE dispersible tablets at the start of the treatment for patients \nreceiving regular blood transfusions is 20 mg per kilogram body weight. A higher or lower \n\nstarting dose may be recommended by your doctor based on your individual treatment needs. \n\n The usual daily dose for EXJADE dispersible tablets at the start of the treatment for patients not \n\nreceiving regular blood transfusions is 10 mg per kilogram body weight. \n\n Depending on how you respond to treatment, your doctor may later adjust your treatment to a \nhigher or lower dose. \n\n The maximum recommended daily dose for EXJADE dispersible tablets is 40 mg per kilogram \nbody weight for patients receiving regular blood transfusions, 20 mg per kilogram body weight \n\nfor adult patients not receiving regular blood transfusions and 10 mg per kilogram body weight \n\nfor children and adolescents not receiving regular blood transfusions. \n\n \n\nDeferasirox also comes as “film-coated” tablets and granules. If you are switching from the \n\nfilm-coated tablets or granules to these dispersible tablets, you will need an adjustment of the dose. \n\n \n\nWhen to take EXJADE \n\n Take EXJADE once a day, every day, at about the same time each day. \n\n Take the EXJADE dispersible tablets on an empty stomach. \n\n Then wait at least 30 minutes before eating any food. \nTaking EXJADE at the same time each day will also help you remember when to take your tablets. \n\n \n\nHow to take EXJADE: \n\n Drop the tablet(s) into a glass of water, or apple or orange juice \n(100 to 200 ml). \n\n Stir until the tablet(s) dissolve completely. The liquid in the glass \nwill look cloudy. \n\n Drink everything in the glass. Then add a little water or juice to \nwhat is left in the glass, swirl the liquid around and drink that too. \n\n \nDo not dissolve the tablets in fizzy drinks or milk. \nDo not chew, break or crush the tablets. \nDo not swallow the tablets whole. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\nHow long to take EXJADE \n\nContinue taking EXJADE every day for as long as your doctor tells you. This is a long-term \n\ntreatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to \n\ncheck that the treatment is having the desired effect (see also section 2: “Monitoring your EXJADE \n\ntreatment”). \n\n \n\nIf you have questions about how long to take EXJADE, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more EXJADE than you should \nIf you have taken too much EXJADE, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, contact your \n\ndoctor or hospital for advice straight away. Show the doctor the pack of tablets. Urgent medical \n\ntreatment may be necessary. You may experience effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nand vomiting and kidney or liver problems that can be serious. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take EXJADE \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember on that day. Take your next dose as scheduled. Do \n\nnot take a double dose on the next day to make up for the forgotten tablet(s). \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking EXJADE \nDo not stop taking EXJADE unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop taking it, the excess iron will \n\nno longer be removed from your body (see also above section “How long to take EXJADE”). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

What EXJADE is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat EXJADE is \n\nEXJADE contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a medicine \n\nused to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and removes excess \n\niron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. \n\n \n\nWhat EXJADE is used for \n\nRepeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example \n\nthalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood \n\ntransfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body \n\ndoes not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In \n\npatients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over \n\ntime, mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over \n\ntime, the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron \n\nchelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with \n\nbeta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or \n\ninadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by infrequent blood \n\ntransfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 5 years. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat patients \n\naged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, but who \n\nare not transfusion dependent. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n126 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take EXJADE \n \n\nDo not take EXJADE \n- if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking EXJADE. If you think you \n\nmay be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. \n- if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. \n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended \n\n- if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of \nblood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EXJADE: \n\n- if you have a kidney or liver problem. \n\n- if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. \n\n- if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). \n\n- if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face \n\nand throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n- if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of \n\nthe lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes \n\n(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n- if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or \n\nincreased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). \n\n- if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less \n\nalert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your \n\nblood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4 “Possible side \n\neffects”). \n\n- if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. \n\n- if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking EXJADE. \n\n- if you experience frequent heartburn. \n\n- if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. \n\n- if you have blurred vision \n\n- if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nMonitoring your EXJADE treatment \n\nYou will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in \n\nyour body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well EXJADE is working. The tests will also monitor \n\nyour kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver function \n\n(blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if he/she \n\nsuspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests to \n\ndetermine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration when \n\ndeciding on the dose of EXJADE most suitable for you and will also use these tests to decide when \n\nyou should stop taking EXJADE. \n\n \n\nYour eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n\nOther medicines and EXJADE \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- other iron chelators, which must not be taken with EXJADE, \n\n- antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium, which should not be taken at \n\nthe same time of day as EXJADE, \n\n- ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such \n\nas rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol), \n\n- certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids), \n\n- oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), \n\n- anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent or treat blood clotting), \n\n- hormonal contraceptive agents (birth control medicines), \n\n- bepridil, ergotamine (used for heart problems and migraines), \n\n- repaglinide (used to treat diabetes), \n\n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), \n\n- ritonavir (used in the treatment of HIV infection), \n\n- paclitaxel (used in cancer treatment), \n\n- theophylline (used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma), \n\n- clozapine (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia), \n\n- tizanidine (used as a muscle relaxant), \n\n- cholestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood), \n\n- busulfan (used as a treatment prior to transplantation in order to destroy the original bone \n\nmarrow before the transplant). \n\n \n\nAdditional tests may be required to monitor the blood levels of some of these medicines. \n\n \n\nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \nEXJADE can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. Elderly \n\npatients may experience more side effects (in particular diarrhoea) than younger patients. They should \n\nbe monitored closely by their doctor for side effects that may require a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nEXJADE can be used in children and adolescents receiving regular blood transfusions aged 2 years \n\nand over and in children and adolescents not receiving regular blood transfusions aged 10 years and \n\nover. As the patient grows the doctor will adjust the dose. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended for children aged under 2 years. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nIf you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, \n\nyou should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom), as EXJADE may reduce \n\nthe effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EXJADE. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy after taking EXJADE, do not drive or operate any tools or machines until you are \n\nfeeling normal again. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n\n3. How to take EXJADE \n \n\nTreatment with EXJADE will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of iron \n\noverload caused by blood transfusions. \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much EXJADE to take \n\nThe dose of EXJADE is related to body weight for all patients. Your doctor will calculate the dose you \n\nneed and tell you how many tablets to take each day. \n\n The usual daily dose for EXJADE film-coated tablets at the start of the treatment for patients \nreceiving regular blood transfusions is 14 mg per kilogram body weight. A higher or lower \n\nstarting dose may be recommended by your doctor based on your individual treatment needs. \n\n The usual daily dose for EXJADE film-coated tablets at the start of the treatment for patients \n\nnot receiving regular blood transfusions is 7 mg per kilogram body weight. \n\n Depending on how you respond to treatment, your doctor may later adjust your treatment to a \nhigher or lower dose. \n\n The maximum recommended daily dose for EXJADE film-coated tablets is: \n\n 28 mg per kilogram body weight for patients receiving regular blood transfusions, \n\n 14 mg per kilogram body weight for adult patients not receiving regular blood \ntransfusions, \n\n 7 mg per kilogram body weight for children and adolescents not receiving regular blood \ntransfusions. \n\n \n\nDeferasirox also comes as “dispersible” tablets. If you are switching from the dispersible tablets to \n\nthese film-coated tablets, you will need an adjustment of the dose. \n\n \n\nWhen to take EXJADE \n\n Take EXJADE once a day, every day, at about the same time each day with some water. \n\n Take EXJADE film-coated tablets either on an empty stomach or with a light meal. \nTaking EXJADE at the same time each day will also help you remember when to take your tablets. \n\n \n\nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, EXJADE film-coated tablets may be crushed \n\nand taken by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food such as yogurt or apple sauce (pureed apple). The \n\nfood should be immediately and completely consumed. Do not store it for future use. \n\n \n\nHow long to take EXJADE \n\nContinue taking EXJADE every day for as long as your doctor tells you. This is a long-term \n\ntreatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to \n\ncheck that the treatment is having the desired effect (see also section 2: “Monitoring your EXJADE \n\ntreatment”). \n\n \n\nIf you have questions about how long to take EXJADE, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more EXJADE than you should \nIf you have taken too much EXJADE, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, contact your \n\ndoctor or hospital for advice straight away. Show the doctor the pack of tablets. Urgent medical \n\ntreatment may be necessary. You may experience effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nand vomiting and kidney or liver problems that can be serious. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take EXJADE \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember on that day. Take your next dose as scheduled. Do \n\nnot take a double dose on the next day to make up for the forgotten tablet(s). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\nIf you stop taking EXJADE \nDo not stop taking EXJADE unless your doctor tells you to.

What EXJADE is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat EXJADE is \n\nEXJADE contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a medicine \n\nused to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and removes excess \n\niron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. \n\n \n\nWhat EXJADE is used for \n\nRepeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example \n\nthalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood \n\ntransfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body \n\ndoes not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In \n\npatients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over \n\ntime, mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over \n\ntime, the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron \n\nchelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with \n\nbeta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or \n\ninadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by infrequent blood \n\ntransfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 5 years. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat patients \n\naged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, but who \n\nare not transfusion dependent. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take EXJADE \n \n\nDo not take EXJADE \n- if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking EXJADE. If you think you \n\nmay be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. \n- if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. \n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended \n\n- if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of \nblood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EXJADE: \n\n- if you have a kidney or liver problem. \n\n- if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. \n\n- if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). \n\n- if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face \n\nand throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n- if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of \n\nthe lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes \n\n(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n- if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or \n\nincreased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). \n\n- if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less \n\nalert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your \n\nblood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4 “Possible side \n\neffects”). \n\n- if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. \n\n- if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking EXJADE. \n\n- if you experience frequent heartburn. \n\n- if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. \n\n- if you have blurred vision \n\n- if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nMonitoring your EXJADE treatment \n\nYou will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in \n\nyour body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well EXJADE is working. The tests will also monitor \n\nyour kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver function \n\n(blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if he/she \n\nsuspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests to \n\ndetermine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration when \n\ndeciding on the dose of EXJADE most suitable for you and will also use these tests to decide when \n\nyou should stop taking EXJADE. \n\n \n\nYour eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\nOther medicines and EXJADE \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- other iron chelators, which must not be taken with EXJADE, \n\n- antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium, which should not be taken at \n\nthe same time of day as EXJADE, \n\n- ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such \n\nas rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol), \n\n- certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids), \n\n- oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), \n\n- anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent or treat blood clotting), \n\n- hormonal contraceptive agents (birth control medicines), \n\n- bepridil, ergotamine (used for heart problems and migraines), \n\n- repaglinide (used to treat diabetes), \n\n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), \n\n- ritonavir (used in the treatment of HIV infection), \n\n- paclitaxel (used in cancer treatment), \n\n- theophylline (used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma), \n\n- clozapine (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia), \n\n- tizanidine (used as a muscle relaxant), \n\n- cholestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood), \n\n- busulfan (used as a treatment prior to transplantation in order to destroy the original bone \n\nmarrow before the transplant). \n\n \n\nAdditional tests may be required to monitor the blood levels of some of these medicines. \n\n \n\nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \nEXJADE can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. Elderly \n\npatients may experience more side effects (in particular diarrhoea) than younger patients. They should \n\nbe monitored closely by their doctor for side effects that may require a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nEXJADE can be used in children and adolescents receiving regular blood transfusions aged 2 years \n\nand over and in children and adolescents not receiving regular blood transfusions aged 10 years and \n\nover. As the patient grows the doctor will adjust the dose. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended for children aged under 2 years. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nEXJADE is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nIf you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, \n\nyou should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom), as EXJADE may reduce \n\nthe effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EXJADE. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy after taking EXJADE, do not drive or operate any tools or machines until you are \n\nfeeling normal again. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n\n3. How to take EXJADE \n \n\nTreatment with EXJADE will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of iron \n\noverload caused by blood transfusions. \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much EXJADE to take \n\nThe dose of EXJADE is related to body weight for all patients. Your doctor will calculate the dose you \n\nneed and tell you how many sachets to take each day. \n\n The usual daily dose for EXJADE granules at the start of the treatment for patients receiving \nregular blood transfusions is 14 mg per kilogram body weight. A higher or lower starting dose \n\nmay be recommended by your doctor based on your individual treatment needs. \n\n The usual daily dose for EXJADE granules at the start of the treatment for patients not receiving \n\nregular blood transfusions is 7 mg per kilogram body weight. \n\n Depending on how you respond to treatment, your doctor may later adjust your treatment to a \nhigher or lower dose. \n\n The maximum recommended daily dose for EXJADE granules: \n\n 28 mg per kilogram body weight for patients receiving regular blood transfusions, \n\n 14 mg per kilogram body weight for adult patients not receiving regular blood \ntransfusions, \n\n 7 mg per kilogram body weight for children and adolescents not receiving regular blood \ntransfusions. \n\n \n\nDeferasirox also comes as “dispersible” tablets. If you are switching from the dispersible tablets to \n\nthese granules, you will need an adjustment of the dose. \n\n \n\nWhen to take EXJADE \n\n Take EXJADE once a day, every day, at about the same time each day. \n\n Take EXJADE granules either with or without a light meal. \nTaking EXJADE at the same time each day will also help you remember when to take your medicine. \n\n \n\nEXJADE granules should be taken by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food such as yogurt or apple \n\nsauce (pureed apple). The food should be immediately and completely consumed. Do not store it for \n\nfuture use. \n\n \n\nHow long to take EXJADE \n\nContinue taking EXJADE every day for as long as your doctor tells you. This is a long-term \n\ntreatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to \n\ncheck that the treatment is having the desired effect (see also section 2: “Monitoring your EXJADE \n\ntreatment”). \n\n \n\nIf you have questions about how long to take EXJADE, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more EXJADE than you should \nIf you have taken too much EXJADE, or if someone else accidentally takes your granules, contact \n\nyour doctor or hospital for advice straight away. Show the doctor the pack of granules. Urgent medical \n\ntreatment may be necessary. You may experience effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nand vomiting and kidney or liver problems that can be serious. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take EXJADE \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember on that day. Take your next dose as scheduled. Do \n\nnot take a double dose on the next day to make up for the forgotten granules. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\nIf you stop taking EXJADE \nDo not stop taking EXJADE unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop taking it, the excess iron will \n\nno longer be removed from your body (see also above section “How long to take EXJADE”). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
