This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXospata 40 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 40 mg gilteritinib (as fumarate)  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nRound, light yellow film-coated tablet, debossed with the company logo and \u2018235\u2019 on the same side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or \nrefractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Xospata should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanti-cancer therapies.  \n \nBefore taking gilteritinib, relapsed or refractory AML patients must have confirmation of FMS-like \ntyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation (internal tandem duplication [ITD] or tyrosine kinase domain \n[TKD]) using a validated test. \n \nXospata may be re-initiated in patients following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) \n(see Table 1). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 120 mg gilteritinib (three 40 mg tablets) once daily. \n \nBlood chemistries, including creatine phosphokinase, should be assessed prior to initiation of \ntreatment, on day 15 and monthly for the duration of treatment.  \n \nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed before initiation of gilteritinib treatment, on day 8 \nand 15 of cycle 1 and prior to the start of the next three subsequent months of treatment (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nTreatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from Xospata or until \nunacceptable toxicity occurs. Response may be delayed; therefore, continuation of treatment at the \nprescribed dose for up to 6 months should be considered to allow time for a clinical response. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIn the absence of a response (patient did not achieve a CRc) after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose can \nbe increased to 200 mg (five 40 mg tablets) once daily, if tolerated or clinically warranted. \n \nDose modifications \n \nTable 1. Xospata dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation recommendations in \npatients with relapsed or refractory AML \nCriteria Xospata dosing \nSymptoms of differentiation syndrome \u2022 If differentiation syndrome is suspected, \n\nadminister corticosteroids and initiate \nhemodynamic monitoring (see section 4.4).  \n\n\u2022 Interrupt gilteritinib if severe signs and/or \nsymptoms persist for more than 48 hours \nafter initiation of corticosteroids.  \n\n\u2022 Resume gilteritinib at the same dose when \nsigns and symptoms improve to Grade 2a or \nlower. \n\nSymptoms of posterior reversible \nencephalopathy syndrome \n\n\u2022 Discontinue gilteritinib. \n\nQTc interval >500 msec \u2022 Interrupt gilteritinib.  \n\u2022 Resume gilteritinib at a reduced dose (80 mg \n\nor 120 mgb) when QTc interval returns to \nwithin 30 msec of baseline or \u2264 480 msec. \n\nQTc interval increased by >30 msec on \nECG on day 8 of cycle 1 \n\n\u2022 Confirm with ECG on day 9. \n\u2022 If confirmed, consider dose reduction to \n\n80 mg or 120 mgb. \nSymptoms of pancreatitis \u2022 Interrupt gilteritinib until pancreatitis is \n\nresolved.  \n\u2022 Resume treatment with gilteritinib at a \n\nreduced dose (80 mg or 120 mgb). \nOther Grade 3a or higher toxicity \nconsidered related to treatment. \n\n\u2022 Interrupt gilteritinib until toxicity resolves or \nimproves to Grade 1a.  \n\n\u2022 Resume treatment with gilteritinib at a \nreduced dose (80 mg or 120 mgb). \n\nPlanned HSCT \u2022 Interrupt treatment with gilteritinib one week \nprior to administration of the conditioning \nregimen for HSCT.  \n\n\u2022 Treatment can be resumed 30 days after \nHSCT if engraftment was successful, the \npatient did not have grade \u22652 acute graft \nversus host disease and was in CRc.c  \n\na. Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is serious, Grade 4 is life-threatening. \nb. The daily dose can be reduced from 120 mg to 80 mg or from 200 mg to 120 mg. \nc. Composite complete remission (CRc) is defined as the remission rate of all CR (see section 5.1 \n\nfor definition of CR), CRp [achieved CR except for incomplete platelet recovery (<100 x \n109/L)] and CRi (achieved all criteria for CR except for incomplete haematological recovery \nwith residual neutropenia <1 x 109/L with or without complete platelet recovery). \n\n \nXospata should be administered at about the same time each day. If a dose is missed or not taken at the \nusual time, the dose should be administered as soon as possible on the same day, and patients should \nreturn to the normal schedule the following day. If vomiting occurs after dosing, patients should not \ntake another dose but should return to the normal schedule the following day. \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients \u226565 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh \nClass B) hepatic impairment. Xospata is not recommended for use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh \nClass C) hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in this population (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xospata in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established.  \nNo data are available. Due to in vitro binding to 5HT2B (see section 4.5), there is a potential impact on \ncardiac development in patients less than 6 months of age. \n \nMethod of administration  \nXospata is for oral use.  \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food. They should be swallowed whole with water and should \nnot be broken or crushed.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDifferentiation syndrome  \nGilteritinib has been associated with differentiation syndrome (see section 4.8). Differentiation \nsyndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be \nlife-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms and clinical findings of differentiation syndrome \ninclude fever, dyspnoea, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, hypotension, rapid \nweight gain, peripheral oedema, rash, and renal dysfunction.  \n \nIf differentiation syndrome is suspected, corticosteroid therapy should be initiated along with \nhemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution. If severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more \nthan 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, Xospata should be interrupted until signs and \nsymptoms are no longer severe (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  \n \nCorticosteroids can be tapered after resolution of symptoms and should be administered for a \nminimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation \nof corticosteroid treatment. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  \nThere have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving \nXospata (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with \nrapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, visual and neurological \ndisturbances, with or without associated hypertension and altered mental status. If PRES is suspected, \nit should be confirmed by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \nDiscontinuation of Xospata in patients who develop PRES is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nProlonged QT interval \nGilteritinib has been associated with prolonged cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT Interval) (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). QT prolongation can be observed in the first two months of treatment with \ngilteritinib. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed prior to initiation of treatment, \non day 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and prior to the start of the next three subsequent months of treatment. \nCaution is warranted in patients with relevant cardiac history. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia \n\n\n\n5 \n\nmay increase the QT prolongation risk. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia should therefore be \ncorrected prior to and during Xospata treatment. \n \nXospata should be interrupted in patients who have a QTcF >500 msec (see section 4.2).  \n \nThe decision to re-introduce gilteritinib treatment after an event of QT prolongation should be based \non a careful consideration of benefits and risks. If Xospata is re-introduced at a reduced dose, ECG \nshould be performed after 15 days of dosing, and prior to the start of the next three subsequent months \nof treatment. In clinical studies, 12 patients had QTcF >500 msec. Three patients interrupted and re-\ninitiated treatment without recurrence of QT prolongation. \n \nPancreatitis \nThere have been reports of pancreatitis. Patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of \npancreatitis should be evaluated and monitored. Xospata should be interrupted and can be resumed at a \nreduced dose when the signs and symptoms of pancreatitis have resolved (see section 4.2).  \n \nInteractions \nCo-administration of CYP3A/P-gp inducers may lead to decreased gilteritinib exposure and \nconsequently a risk for lack of efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of gilteritinib with strong \nCYP3A4/P-gp inducers should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nCaution is required when concomitantly prescribing gilteritinib with medicinal products that are strong \ninhibitors of CYP3A and/or P-gp (such as, but not limited to, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole \nand clarithromycin ) because they can increase gilteritinib exposure. Alternative medicinal products \nthat do not strongly inhibit CYP3A and/or P-gp activity should be considered. In situations where \nsatisfactory therapeutic alternatives do not exist, patients should be closely monitored for toxicities \nduring administration of gilteritinib (see section 4.5). \n \nGilteritinib may reduce the effects of medicinal products that target 5HT2B receptor or sigma \nnonspecific receptors. Therefore, concomitant use of gilteritinib with these products should be avoided \nunless use is considered essential for the care of the patient (see section 4.5). \n \nEmbryofoetal toxicity and contraception   \nPregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \nFemales of reproductive potential should be advised to have a pregnancy test within seven days prior \nto starting treatment with Xospata and to use effective contraception during treatment with Xospata \nand for at least 6 months after stopping treatment. Women using hormonal contraceptives should add a \nbarrier method of contraception. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should be \nadvised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of \nXospata.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nGilteritinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, which can be induced or inhibited by a \nnumber of concomitant medicinal products. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on Xospata \nCYP3A/P-gp Inducers \nConcomitant use of Xospata with strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin and St. \nJohn\u2019s Wort) should be avoided because they can decrease gilteritinib plasma concentrations. In \nhealthy subjects, co-administration of rifampicin (600 mg), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, to steady \nstate with a single 20 mg dose of gilteritinib decreased gilteritinib mean Cmax by 27% and mean \nAUCinf by 70%, respectively, compared to subjects administered a single dose of gilteritinib alone (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCYP3A and/or P-gp inhibitors \nStrong inhibitors of CYP3A and/or P-gp (e.g., voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, captopril, carvedilol, ritonavir, azithromycin) can increase gilteritinib \nplasma concentrations. A single, 10 mg dose of gilteritinib co-administered with itraconazole (200 mg \nonce daily for 28 days), a strong CYP3A and/or P-gp inhibitor, to healthy subjects resulted in an \napproximate 20% increase in mean Cmax and 2.2-fold increase in mean AUCinf relative to subjects \nadministered a single dose of gilteritinib alone. Gilteritinib exposure increased approximately 1.5-fold \nin patients with relapsed or refractory AML when co-administered with a strong CYP3A and/or P-gp \ninhibitor (see section 4.4). \n \nGilteritinib as an inhibitor or inducer \nGilteritinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 or and inhibitor of MATE1 in vivo. The \npharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) were not significantly (Cmax and AUC \nincreased approximately 10%) affected after once-daily administration of gilteritinib (300 mg) for 15 \ndays in patients with FLT3-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics \nof cephalexin (a sensitive MATE1 substrate) were not significantly (Cmax and AUC decreased by less \nthan 10%) affected after once daily administration of gilteritinib (200 mg) for 15 days in patients with \nFLT3-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. \n \nEffects of Xospata on other medicinal products \n5HT2B receptor or sigma nonspecific receptor \nBased on in vitro data, gilteritinib may reduce the effects of medicinal products that target 5HT2B \nreceptor or sigma nonspecific receptor (e.g., escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline). Avoid concomitant \nuse of these medicinal products with Xospata unless use is considered essential for the care of the \npatient.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \nPregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential seven days prior to initiating \nXospata treatment. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use effective contraception \n(methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during and up to 6 months after treatment. It is \nunknown whether gilteritinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore \nwomen using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception. Males of \nreproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \nleast 4 months after the last dose of Xospata (see section 4.4).  \n \nPregnancy \nGilteritinib can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no or limited \namount of data from the use of gilteritinib in pregnant women. Reproductive studies in rats have \nshown that gilteritinib caused suppressed foetal growth, embryo-foetal deaths and teratogenicity (see \nsection 5.3). Xospata is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential \nnot using effective contraception.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether gilteritinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available animal data \nhave shown excretion of gilteritinib and its metabolites in the animal milk of lactating rats and \ndistribution to the tissues in infant rats via the milk (see section 5.3).  \n \nA risk to the breast-fed children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during \ntreatment with Xospata and for at least two months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of gilterinitib on human fertility.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGilteritinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been reported \nin patients taking Xospata and should be considered when assessing a patient\u2019s ability to drive or use \nmachines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Xospata was evaluated in 319 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who have \nreceived at least one dose of 120 mg gilteritinib. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions with gilteritinib were blood creatine phosphokinase increased \n(93.4%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (82.1%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \nincreased (80.6%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (68.7%), diarrhoea (35.1%), fatigue (30.4%), \nnausea (29.8%), constipation (28.2%), cough (28.2%), peripheral oedema (24.1%), dyspnea (24.1%), \ndizziness (20.4%), hypotension (17.2%), pain in extremity (14.7%), asthenia (13.8%), arthralgia \n(12.5%) and myalgia (12.5%). \n \nThe most frequent serious adverse reactions were diarrhoea (4.7%), ALT increased (4.1%), dyspnea \n(3.4%), AST increased (3.1%) and hypotension (2.8%). Other clinically significant serious adverse \nreactions included differentiation syndrome (2.2%), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (0.9%) and \nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (0.6%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency \ncategories are defined as follows: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions \n\nAdverse drug reaction \n\nAll \nGrades \n\n% \n\nGrades \n\u22653 \n% \n\nFrequency \ncategory \n\nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylactic reaction 1.3 1.3 Common \nNervous system disorders \nDizziness 20.4 0.3 Very common \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome  0.6 0.6 Uncommon \nCardiac disorders \nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged 8.8 2.5 Common \nPericardial effusion 4.1 0.9 Common \nPericarditis 1.6 0 Common \nCardiac failure 1.3 1.3 Common \nVascular disorders \nHypotension 17.2 7.2 Very common \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCough 28.2 0.3 Very common \nDyspnoea 24.1 4.4 Very common \nDifferentiation syndrome 3.4 2.2 Common \nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhoea 35.1 4.1 Very common \n\n\n\n8 \n\nNausea 29.8 1.9 Very common \nConstipation 28.2 0.6 Very common \nHepatobiliary disorders \nAlanine aminotransferase increased* 82.1 12.9 Very common \nAspartate aminotransferase increased* 80.6 10.3 Very common \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nBlood creatine phosphokinase \nincreased* 53.9 6.3 Very common \nBlood alkaline phosphatase increased* 68.7 1.6 Very common \nPain in extremity 14.7 0.6 Very common \nArthralgia 12.5 1.3 Very common \nMyalgia 12.5 0.3 Very common \nMusculoskeletal pain 4.1 0.3 Common \nRenal and urinary disorders \nAcute kidney injury 6.6 2.2 Common \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nFatigue 30.4 3.1 Very common \nPeripheral oedema 24.1 0.3 Very common \nAsthenia 13.8 2.5 Very common \nMalaise 4.4 0 Common \n* Frequency is based on central laboratory values. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDifferentiation syndrome \nOf 319 patients treated with Xospata in the clinical studies, 11 (3%) experienced differentiation \nsyndrome. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of \nmyeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms and clinical findings of \ndifferentiation syndrome in patients treated with Xospata included fever, dyspnoea, pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, hypotension, rapid weight gain, peripheral oedema, rash, and \nrenal dysfunction. Some cases had concomitant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Differentiation \nsyndrome occurred as early as two days and up to 75 days after Xospata initiation and has been \nobserved with or without concomitant leukocytosis. Of the 11 patients who experienced differentiation \nsyndrome, 9 (82%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of Xospata. For \nrecommendations in case of suspected differentiation syndrome see sections 4.2 and 4.4. \n \nPRES \nOf the 319 patients treated with Xospata in the clinical studies, 0.6% experienced posterior reversible \nencephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder, which can \npresent with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, visual and \nneurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. Symptoms have resolved after \ndiscontinuation of treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nQT prolongation \nOf the 317 patients treated with gilteritinib at 120 mg with a post-baseline QTC value in clinical \nstudies, 4 patients (1%) experienced a QTcF >500 msec. Additionally, across all doses, 12 patients \n(2.3%) with relapsed/refractory AML had a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval >500 msec (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known specific antidote for Xospata. In the event of an overdose, patients must be closely \nmonitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic and supportive \ntreatment initiated, taking into consideration the long half-life estimated at 113 hours. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE54 \n \nMechanism of action \nGilteritinib fumarate is a FLT3 and AXL inhibitor.  \nGilteritinib inhibits FLT3 receptor signalling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3 \nincluding FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-ITD-D835Y, and it induced apoptosis in leukemic \ncells expressing FLT3-ITD. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving gilteritinib 120 mg, substantial (> 90%) \ninhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was rapid (within 24 hours after first dose) and sustained, as \ncharacterised by an ex vivo plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay.  \n \nProlonged QT interval  \nA concentration-related increase in change from baseline of QTcF was observed across gilteritinib \ndoses ranging from 20 to 450 mg. The predicted mean change from baseline of QTcF at the mean \nsteady-state Cmax (282.0 ng/mL) at the 120 mg daily dose was 4.96 msec with an upper 1-sided 95% \nCI = 6.20 msec.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nRelapsed or refractory AML \nEfficacy and safety was evaluated in the active-controlled, phase 3 study (2215-CL-0301) . \n \nADMIRAL study (2215-CL-0301) \nThe ADMIRAL study is a Phase 3, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical study of adult patients \nwith relapsed or refractory AML with a FLT3 mutation as determined by the LeukoStrat\u00ae CDx FLT3 \nMutation Assay. In this study, 371 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib or one \nof the following salvage chemotherapies (247 in the gilteritinib arm and 124 in the salvage \nchemotherapy arm): \n\n \n\u2022 cytarabine 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) for 10 days (days 1 \n\nthrough 10) (LoDAC) \n\u2022 azacitidine 75 mg/m2 once daily by SC or IV for 7 days (days 1 through 7)  \n\u2022 mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2, etoposide 100 mg/m2 and cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 once daily by IV for 5 \n\ndays (days 1 through 5) (MEC) \n\u2022 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 300 mcg/m2 once daily by SC for 5 days (days 1 to 5), \n\nfludarabine 30 mg/m2 once daily by IV for 5 days (days 2 through 6), cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 \nonce daily by IV for 5 days (days 2 through 6), idarubicin 10 mg/m2 once daily by IV for 3 days \n(days 2 through 4) (FLAG-Ida). \n\n \nPatients included were relapsed or refractory after first line AML therapy and were stratified by \nresponse to prior AML treatment and preselected chemotherapy i.e. high or low intensity. While the \nstudy included patients with various AML-related cytogenetic abnormalities, patients with acute \npromyelocytic leukaemia (APL) or therapy-related AML were excluded. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSixteen patients were randomised but not treated in the study (1 patient in the gilteritinib arm and 15 \npatients in the chemotherapy arm). Gilteritinib was given orally at a starting dose of 120 mg daily until \nunacceptable toxicity or lack of clinical benefit. Dose reductions were allowed, to manage adverse \nreactions, and dose increases were allowed, for those patients who did not respond at the starting dose \nof 120 mg. \n \nOf the patients who were pre-selected to receive salvage chemotherapy, 60.5% were randomised to \nhigh intensity and 39.5% to low intensity. MEC and FLAG-Ida were given for up to two cycles \ndepending on response to first cycle. LoDAC and azacitidine were given in continuous 4-week cycles \nuntil unacceptable toxicity or lack of clinical benefit. \n \nThe demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. \nThe median age at randomisation was 62 years (range 20 to 84 years) in the gilteritinib arm and 62 \nyears (range 19 to 85 years) in the salvage chemotherapy arm. In the study 42% of patients were 65 \nyears or older and 12% were 75 years or older. Fifty-four percent of the patients were female. Most \npatients in the study were Caucasian (59.3%); 27.5% Asian, 5.7% Black, 4% other races and 3.5% \nunknown. The majority of patients (83.8%) had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients \nhad the following confirmed mutations: FLT3-ITD alone (88.4%), FLT3-TKD alone (8.4%) or both \nFLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD (1.9%). Twelve percent of patients received previous treatment with \nanother FLT3 inhibitor. A majority of patients had AML with intermediate risk cytogenetics (73%), \n10% had unfavourable, 1.3% had favourable and 15.6% had unclassified cytogenetics.  \n \nPrior to treatment with gilteritinib, 39.4% of patients had primary refractory AML and the majority of \nthese patients were classified as refractory after 1 cycle of chemotherapy induction treatment, 19.7% \nhad relapsed AML after an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and 41% had \nrelapsed AML with no allogeneic HSCT.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint for the final analysis was OS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, \nmeasured from the date of randomisation until death by any cause (number of events analysed was \n261). Patients randomised to the gilteritinib arm had significantly longer survival compared to the \nchemotherapy arm (HR 0.637; 95% CI 0.490 \u2013 0.830; 1 sided p-value: 0.0004). The median OS was \n9.3 months for patients receiving gilteritinib and 5.6 months for those receiving chemotherapy. \nEfficacy was further supported by the rate of complete remission (CR)/complete remission with partial \nhaematologic recovery (CRh) (Table 3, Figure 1). \n \nTable 3: ADMIRAL study overall survival and complete remission in patients with relapsed or \nrefractory AML \n Gilteritinib \n\n(N=247) \nChemotherapy \n\n(N=124) \nOverall survival \nDeaths, n (%) 171 (69.2) 90 (72.6) \nMedian in months (95% CI) 9.3 (7.7, 10.7) 5.6 (4.7, 7.3) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI) 0.637 (0.490, 0.830) \np-value (1-sided) 0.0004 \n1 year survival rate, % (95% CI) 37.1 (30.7, 43.6) 16.7 (9.9, 25) \nComplete remission \nCRa (95% CIb) 21.1% (16.1, 26.7) 10.5% (5.7, 17.3) \nCRhc (95% CIb) 13% (9, 17.8) 4.8% (1.8, 10.2) \nCR/CRh (95% CIb) 34% (28.1, 40.3) 15.3% (9.5, 22.9) \nCI: confidence interval \na.

The median time to best response of CR/CRh was 3.8 months (range, 0.9 to 16 \nmonths) in the gilteritinib arm and 1.2 months (range: 1 to 2.6 months) in the salvage chemotherapy \narm. \n \nCHRYSALIS study (2215-CL-0101) \nThe supportive Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study 2215-CL-0101 included 157 patients with FLT3 \nmutated AML treated with either 1 or >1 prior lines of treatment in the combined dose group (i.e. \n80 mg, 120 mg or 200 mg);  31.2% received 1 prior line of treatment and 68.8% received >1 prior \nlines of treatment.  \n \nThe response rate (CR/CRh) observed in Study 2215-CL-0101 in the patients who received more than \n1 line of prior therapy was 21.4% and 15.7% for the 120 mg dose and the combined dose levels, \nrespectively. The median OS was 7.2 months and 7.1 months for the 120 mg dose and the combined \ndose levels, respectively. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXospata in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute myeloid \nleukaemia. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration of gilteritinib, peak plasma concentrations are observed at a median tmax \napproximately between 4 and 6 hours in healthy volunteers and patients with relapsed or \nrefractory AML. Gilteritinib undergoes first-order absorption with an estimated absorption rate (ka) of \n0.43 h-1 with a lag time of 0.34 hours based on population PK modelling. Median steady-state \nmaximum concentration (Cmax) is 282.0 ng/mL (CV% = 50.8), and area under the plasma \nconcentration curve during 24-hour dosing interval (AUC0-24) is 6180 ng\u00b7h/mL (CV% = 46.4) after \nonce-daily dosing of 120 mg gilteritinib. Steady-state plasma levels are reached within 15 days of \nonce-daily dosing with an approximate 10-fold accumulation. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nEffect of food \nIn healthy adults, gilteritinib Cmax and AUC decreased by approximately 26% and less than 10%, \nrespectively, when a single 40 mg dose of gilteritinib was co-administered with a high fat meal \ncompared to gilteritinib exposure in fasted state. Median tmax was delayed 2 hours when gilteritinib \nwas administered with a high-fat meal. \n \nDistribution \nThe population estimate of central and peripheral volume of distribution were 1092 L and 1100 L, \nrespectively. These data indicate gilteritinib distributes extensively outside of plasma, which may \nindicate extensive tissue distribution. In vivo plasma protein binding in humans is approximately 90% \nand gilteritinib is primarily bound to albumin.  \n \nBiotransformation \nBased on in vitro data, gilteritinib is primarily metabolised via CYP3A4. The primary metabolites in \nhumans include M17 (formed via N-dealkylation and oxidation), M16 and M10 (both formed via \nN-dealkylation) and were observed in animals. None of these three metabolites exceeded 10% of \noverall parent exposure. The pharmacological activity of the metabolites against FLT3 and AXL \nreceptors is unknown.  \n \nTransporter drug-drug interactions \nIn vitro experiments demonstrated that gilteritinib is a P-gp substrate and may potentially inhibit \nBCRP and P-gp in the small intestine, OCT1 in the liver at clinically relevant concentrations (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nElimination \nAfter a single dose of [14C] -gilteritinib, gilteritinib is primarily excreted in faeces with 64.5% of the \ntotal administered dose recovered in faeces. Approximately 16.4% of the total dose was excreted in \nurine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Gilteritinib plasma concentrations declined in a \nbi-exponential manner with a population mean estimated half-life of 113 hours. The estimated \napparent clearance (CL/F) based on the population PK model is 14.85 L/h. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nIn general, gilteritinib exhibited linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after single and multiple \ndose administration at doses ranging from 20 to 450 mg in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.  \n \nSpecial populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic \ncovariates on the predicted exposure of gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. \nCovariate analysis indicated that age (20 years to 90 years), and body weight (36 kg to 157 kg) were \nstatistically significant; however predicted change in gilteritinib exposure was less than 2-fold. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on gilteritinib pharmacokinetics was studied in subjects with mild \n(Child-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Results indicate \nunbound gilteritinib exposure in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment is comparable to \nthat observed in subjects with normal hepatic function. The effect of mild hepatic impairment [as \ndefined by NCI-ODWG] on gilteritinib exposure was also assessed using the population PK model \nand the results demonstrate little difference in predicted steady-state gilteritinib exposure relative to a \ntypical patient with relapsed or refractory AML and normal liver function. \n \nGilteritinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \n \nRenal impairment \nA dedicated renal impairment study has not been conducted to assess of the effect of renal impairment \non gilteritinib pharmacokinetics. The effect of mild or moderate renal impairment was evaluated using \na population pharmacokinetic model. Serum creatinine, a marker of renal function, was identified as a \nstatistically significant covariate. However, the predicted increase on gilteritinib exposure was less \n\n\n\n13 \n\nthan 2-fold. The effect of severe renal impairment on gilteritinib exposure has not been investigated \n(see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals (safety pharmacology/repeat \ndose toxicity) at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to \nclinical use were as follows: \n \nSafety pharmacology \nIn rats, decreased urination at 30 mg/kg and higher and decreased defecation at 100 mg/kg were \nobserved. In dogs, positive faecal occult blood at 10 mg/kg and higher, a decrease in the blood calcium \nconcentration at 30 mg/kg, and salivation and an increase followed by a decrease in the blood calcium \nconcentration at 100 mg/kg were observed. These changes were observed at plasma exposure levels \nsimilar to or less than clinical exposure levels. A possible clinical relevance of these findings is \nunknown. \n \nRepeat dose toxicity \nIn the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, target organs of toxicity were the gastrointestinal \ntract (heamorrhage in dogs), lymphohaematopoietic system (lymphocyte necrosis and bone marrow \nhypocellularity with changes in haematological parameters), eye (inflammation and lens opacity in \nrats, fundus colour change in dogs, retinal vacuolation), lung (interstitial pneumonia in rats and \ninflammation in dogs), kidney (renal tubule changes with a positive urine occult blood reaction) and \nliver (hepatocyte vacuolation), urinary bladder (epithelial vacuolation), epithelial tissue (ulcer and \ninflammation), and phospholipidosis (lung and kidney in rats). These changes were observed at \nplasma exposure levels similar to or less than clinical exposure levels. Reversibility of most of the \nchanges was indicated by the end of the 4-week recovery period. A possible clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown. \n \nGenotoxicity \nGilteritinib did not induce gene mutation or chromosomal aberrations in vitro. The in vivo \nmicronucleus test showed that gilteritinib has a potential to induce micronuclei in mice. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nGilteritinib showed suppressed foetal growth, and induced embryo-foetal deaths and teratogenicity in \nthe embryo-foetal development studies in rats at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels. \nPlacental transfer of gilteritinib was shown in the rat resulting in transfer of radioactivity to the foetus \nsimilar to that observed in maternal plasma.  \n \nGilteritinib was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with milk concentrations being higher than in \nmaternal plasma. Gilteritinib was distributed through the breast milk to different tissues, except for the \nbrain, of suckling rats. \n \nJuvenile animal toxicity study \nIn the juvenile toxicity study in rats, the minimum lethal dose level (2.5 mg/kg/day) was much lower \nthan that of adult rats (20 mg/kg/day). The gastrointestinal tract was identified as one of the target \norgans similar as in adult rats. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xospata is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Xospata  \n3. How to take Xospata  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Xospata  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xospata is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Xospata is \nXospata belongs to a class of cancer medicines called protein kinase inihibitors. It contains the active \nsubstance gilteritinib.  \n \nWhat Xospata is used for \nXospata is used to treat adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a cancer of certain white blood \ncells. Xospata is used if AML is linked to an alteration of a gene called FLT3, and is given to patients \nwhose disease has come back or has not improved after previous treatment.  \n \nHow Xospata works  \nIn AML, patients develop large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. Gilteritinib blocks the action \nof certain enzymes (kinases) needed for the abnormal cells to multiply and grow, thus preventing the \ngrowth of the cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xospata  \n \nDo not take Xospata \n- if you are allergic to gilteritinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to you doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away: \n- if you have any of the following symptoms: fever, trouble breathing, rash, dizziness or \n\nlightheadedness, rapid weight gain, swelling of your arms or legs. These may be signs of a \ncondition called differentiation syndrome (see section 4 \u2013 Possible side effects). Differentiation \n\n\n\n26 \n\nsyndrome can happen any time during the first 3months of Xospata treatment from as early as 2 \ndays after starting. If it occurs, your doctor will monitor you and may give you a medicine to \ntreat your condition. She or he may also pause Xospata treatment until symptoms are reduced. \nYou will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card that is included in the packaging. It \nis important that you keep this Alert Card with you and show it to any healthcare professional \nyou see.  \n\n- if you have a seizure or quickly worsening symptoms such as headache, decreased alertness, \nconfusion, blurred vision or other problems with seeing. These may be signs of a condition \ncalled PRES (see section 4. \u2013 Possible side effects). Your doctor may do a test to check if you \nhave developed PRES and will stop Xospata treatment if it is confirmed that you have PRES. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xospata: \n- if you have a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or a condition called QT \n\nprolongation (see section 4. \u2013 Possible side effects). \n- if you have a history of low levels of the salts potassium or magnesium in your blood, as this \n\nmay increase the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm. \n- if you have severe pain in the upper abdomen and back, nausea and vomiting. These may be \n\nsigns of an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). \n \nAdditional monitoring during treatment with Xospata \nYour doctor will carry out regular blood tests before and during treatment with Xospata. Your doctor \nwill also regularly check your heart function before and during treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give Xospata to children and adolescents under 18 years because it is not known whether it is \nsafe and effective in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Xospata \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Xospata may affect the way these medicines work, or these medicines may affect how \nXospata works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin;  \n- medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as phenytoin;  \n- medicines used to treat fungal infections such as voriconazole, posaconazole or itraconazole; \n- medicines used to treat bacterial infections such as erythromycin, clarithromycin or \n\nazithromycin; \n- medicines used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) such as captopril or carvedilol; \n- medicines used to treat infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as \n\nritonavir; \n- medicines used to treat depression such as escitalopram, fluoxetine or sertraline; \n- St. John\u2019s wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat \n\ndepression. \n \nIf you normally take any of these medicines, your doctor might change it and prescribe a different \nmedicine for you during your treatment with Xospata. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nXospata may harm your unborn baby and should not be used during pregnancy.

you have any of the following symptoms: fever, trouble breathing, rash, dizziness or lightheadedness, rapid weight gain, swelling of your arms or legs. these may be signs of a condition called differentiation syndrome (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). - posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres). contact your doctor straight away if you have a seizure, quickly worsening headache, confusion, or other vision problems.there have been uncommon reports of a condition involving the brain, in patients treated with xospata, called pres (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). - heart rhythm problems (qt prolongation). contact your doctor straight away if you have a change in your heartbeat, or if you feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint. xospata may cause a heart problem called qt prolongation (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). other possible side effects very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - diarrhoea - nausea - constipation - tiredness - swelling due to fluid retention (oedema) - loss of energy, weakness (asthenia) - abnormal blood test results: high levels of blood creatine phosphokinase (indicative of muscle or heart function), alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and/or blood alkaline phosphatase (indicative of liver function) - pain in limbs - joint pain (arthralgia) - muscle pain (myalgia) - cough - shortness of breath (dyspnoea) - dizziness - low blood pressure (hypotension) common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - collection of fluid around the heart, which, if severe, can decrease the heart's ability to pump blood (pericardial effusion) - a vague feeling of discomfort, feeling unwell (malaise) - a severe life-threatening allergic reaction, e.g., swelling in the mouth, tongue, face and throat, itching, hives (anaphylactic reaction) - muscle stiffness - passing less urine, swelling in the legs (signs of sudden kidney injury) uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - inflammation of the heart (pericarditis) - heart failure reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.",
