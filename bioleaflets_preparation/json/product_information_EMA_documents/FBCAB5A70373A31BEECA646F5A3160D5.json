PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in vial. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPROCOMVAX is indicated for vaccination against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b and against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in infants 6 \nweeks to 15 months of age.   \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nInfants born of HBsAg negative mothers should be vaccinated with three 0.5ml doses of \nPROCOMVAX, ideally at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. If the recommended schedule cannot be \nfollowed exactly, the interval between the first two doses should be approximately two months and the \ninterval between the second and third dose should be as close as possible to eight to eleven months.  \nAll three doses must be administered to complete the vaccination regimen. \n \nChildren who receive one dose of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth may be administered \nPROCOMVAX on the schedule of 2, 4, and 12 -15 months of age. \n \nChildren not vaccinated according to recommended schedule \nVaccination schedules for children not vaccinated according to the recommended schedule should be \nconsidered on an individual basis. \n \nMethod of administration \nFOR INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION \nDo not inject intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner \n\nau\ntho\n\nris\ned\n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Individuals who develop \nsymptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity after an injection should not receive further injections of the \nvaccine. \n \nBecause of the potential for immune tolerance (impaired ability to respond to subsequent exposure to \nthe PRP antigen) PROCOMVAX is not recommended for use in infants younger than 6 weeks of age. \n \nIt has been recommended that immunisation should be delayed during the course of an acute febrile \nillness. All vaccines can be administered to infants with minor illnesses such as diarrhoea or mild \nupper-respiratory infection. Infants with moderate or severe febrile illness should only be vaccinated \nas soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nAs for any vaccine, adequate treatment provisions, including adrenaline, should be available for \nimmediate use should an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction occur. \n \nPROCOMVAX must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.  \n \nInfants born of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin and Hepatitis B \nVaccine (Recombinant) at birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series.  The \nsubsequent administration of PROCOMVAX for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in \ninfants who were born of HBsAg positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of \nunknown status has not been studied. \n \nIn infants with bleeding disorders such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, special precautions \nshould be taken against the risk of haematoma following the injection. \n \nSince PROCOMVAX has not been studied in persons who have malignancies or are otherwise \nimmunocompromised, the extent of the immune response in such persons is unknown. \n \nPROCOMVAX will not protect against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae other than \ntype b or against invasive disease (such as meningitis or sepsis) caused by other microorganisms. \n \nPROCOMVAX will not prevent hepatitis caused by other viruses known to infect the liver. Because of \na long incubation period for Hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised infection to be present at the \ntime the vaccine is given.  The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B in such patients. \n \nPROCOMVAX may not induce protective antibody levels immediately following vaccination and \nmay not result in a protective antibody response in all individuals given the vaccine. \n \nAs reported with Haemophilus b Polysaccharide Vaccine and another Haemophilus b Conjugate \nVaccine, cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week after vaccination, prior to the onset of \nthe protective effects of the vaccines. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit \nof vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nImmunogenicity results from open-labeled studies indicate that PROCOMVAX can be administered \nconcomitantly with DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and whole cell Pertussis vaccine),  OPV (Oral \nPoliomyelitis vaccine), IPV ( inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine) and Merck MMR (Measles, Mumps, \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner \n\nau\ntho\n\nris\ned\n\n4 \n\nand Rubella Virus Vaccine Live) using separate sites and syringes for injectable vaccines. \nAdditionally, limited immunogenicity results from an open-labeled, controlled study indicate that \nPROCOMVAX may be administered concomitantly with DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular \nPertussis vaccine), using separate sites and syringes for injectable vaccines. \n \nEfficacy of whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines when given concomitantly with PROCOMVAX \nhas not been established in field trials. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nNot applicable. For paediatric use only. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot applicable. For paediatric use only. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn clinical trials involving the administration of 7,350 doses of PROCOMVAX  to 2,993 healthy \ninfants 6 weeks to 15 months of age, PROCOMVAX  was generally well tolerated. Of these infants, \n1,177 were involved in clinical trials in which most received PROCOMVAX concomitantly with other \nlicensed paediatric vaccines. Of these, 1,110 were monitored for both serious and non-serious adverse \nexperiences. The remaining 1,816 infants were involved in trials where PROCOMVAX  was \nadministered concomitantly with either an investigational pneumococcal polysaccharide protein \nconjugate vaccine or an investigational preparation of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated \npoliovirus vaccine and were under surveillance for serious adverse experiences. \n \nAmong the 2,993 children given PROCOMVAX, 33 had serious adverse experiences within 14 days \nof vaccination. None of the serious adverse experiences was judged by the study investigator to be \nrelated to this vaccine. \n \nIn one of these trials, a randomized, multicenter study, 882 infants were assigned in a 3:1 ratio to \nreceive either PROCOMVAX or Merck Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein \nConjugate) (Merck PRP-OMPC Vaccine) plus Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine at 2, 4, and \n12-15 months of age, with the children monitored daily for five days after each injection for local \nreactions and systemic complaints. Most children received DTP and OPV concomitantly with the first \ntwo doses of PROCOMVAX or Merck PRP-OMPC Vaccine or Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) \nVaccine. Across all three doses of PROCOMVAX, there were no significant differences in the \nfrequency of adverse experiences between PROCOMVAX and the monovalent vaccines Merck PRP-\nOMPC Vaccine and Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine. However, the frequency of irritability \nwas statistically higher after all three injections of PROCOMVAX combined and after the first \ninjection of PROCOMVAX compared to the monovalent vaccines.  \nThe following local reactions and systemic complaints were reported in ≥1.0 % of children within five \ndays after any injection of PROCOMVAX: pain/soreness, erythema, swelling/induration at the \ninjection site; fever (>38.3 °C, rectal equivalent); anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea; irritability, \nsomnolence, crying including unusual high-pitched crying, prolonged crying (>4hrs), and crying not \notherwise specified; otitis media. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse events was seen \nwith subsequent doses. \n\n \nPost marketing Experience \n \nPROCOMVAX \nHypersensitivity \nRarely : anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, erythema multiforme. \n \nNervous System \nSeizure, febrile seizure \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner \n\nau\ntho\n\nris\ned\n\n5 \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nApnoea in very premature infants (≤ 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin \nInjection site nodule \n \nPotential Adverse Effects \n \nIn addition, a variety of adverse effects have been reported with marketed use of either Merck PRP-\nOMPC Vaccine or Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine in infants and children through 71 \nmonths of age.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group : anti infectious, ATC code : J07CA \nPROCOMVAX is a sterile bivalent vaccine made of the antigenic components used in producing \nMerck PRP-OMPC Vaccine and Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine. These components are \nthe Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (PRP) that is covalently bound to an outer \nmembrane protein complex (OMPC) of Neisseria meningitidis and hepatitis B surface antigen \n(HBsAg) from recombinant yeast cultures. \n\n \nThe protective efficacy of the components of PROCOMVAX has been established in field trials \nperformed with the monovalent vaccines. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner \n\nau\ntho\n\nris\ned\n\n6 \n\n \nAnti-HBs Responses to PROCOMVAX in Infants Not Previously Vaccinated with Hepatitis B Vaccine \n\n \nIn 4 clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2000, PROCOMVAX was administered to 1809 \ninfants, approximately 2 months of age, who had not previously received any hepatitis B vaccine. \nThese infants nominally received PROCOMVAX at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. \n\n \nIn these studies, 1503 infants had anti-HBs results available following the first 2 doses of \nPROCOMVAX and 1309 had anti-HBs results available following the third dose of PROCOMVAX. \nPost-dose 2, 77% to 96% of infants developed a protective level of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/ml) and the \nGMTs ranged from 30 mIU/ml to 190 mIU/ml. Post-dose 3, 96 % to 100 % of infants developed a \nprotective level of anti-HBs and the GMTs ranged from 897 mIU/ml to 4467 mIU/ml. \n \nAnti-HBs Responses to PROCOMVAX in Infants Previously Vaccinated with Hepatitis B Vaccine \n \nIn 4 clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2000, PROCOMVAX was administered to 722 \ninfants, approximately 2 months of age, who had previously received a single dose of hepatitis B \nvaccine at birth. These infants nominally received PROCOMVAX at 2-3, 4-5, and 12-15 months of \nage  \n \nIn these studies, 618 infants had anti-HBs results available following the first 2 doses of \nPROCOMVAX and 461 had anti-HBs results available following the third dose of PROCOMVAX. \nPost-dose 2, 93 % to 100 % of infants developed a protective level of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/ml) and the \nGMTs ranged from 125 mIU/ml to 417 mIU/ml. Post-dose 3, 98 % to 100 % of infants developed a \nprotective level of anti-HBs and the GMTs ranged from 1509 mIU/ml to 3913 mIU/ml. \n \nThe duration of the protective effect for hepatitis B in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present and the \nneed for a routine booster dose with hepatitis B-containing vaccines is not yet defined. \n \nAnti-PRP Responses to PROCOMVAX in Infants \n \nIn 6 clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2000, PROCOMVAX was administered to 2528 \ninfants, approximately 2 months of age, who had not previously received any Hib vaccine.

The vaccine can be \nadministered in most infants 6 weeks to 15 months of age. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE PROCOMVAX \n \nDo not use PROCOMVAX: \n- if your child is allergic to any component of the vaccine. \n-  in infants younger than 6 weeks of age \n- if your child has  fever (vaccination should be delayed). \n- in infants born to HBsAg positive mothers. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner \n\nau\ntho\n\nris\ned\n\n17 \n\n \nTake special care with PROCOMVAX: \n \n- if your child has bleeding disorders such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia , special \n\nprecautions should be taken against the risk of haematoma following injection. \n- if you are a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mother, your infant should \n\nreceive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine (Recombinant) at birth \nand should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series. The subsequent administration of \nPROCOMVAX for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of \nHBsAg-positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has \nnot been studied.  \n\n- as with other similar vaccines, cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week after \nvaccination prior to the onset of the protective effects of the vaccine.  \n\n- because hepatitis B infection can go undetected for a long period of time, it is possible that an \nindividual may already be infected at the time the vaccine is given. The vaccine may not prevent \nhepatitis B in these individuals. \n\n \nUsing other vaccines  \n \nPROCOMVAX can be administered simultaneously with the primary series of diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis vaccine (DTP) and oral polio vaccine (OPV).  At 12 to 15 months of age, PROCOMVAX \nmay be given simultaneously with Merck MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), \nor OPV or with a booster dose of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) at 15 months \nof age in children who received the primary series of DTP. \n \nPROCOMVAX  has been administered simultaneously with the primary series of DTaP and enhanced \ninactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to a limited number of infants. No serious vaccine-related side \neffects were reported. Immune response data are satisfactory for PROCOMVAX but are currently \nunavailable for DTaP. \n \n \n3.  HOW TO USE PROCOMVAX \n \nInfants born of HBsAg negative mothers should be vaccinated with three 0.5 ml doses of \nPROCOMVAX, ideally at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. If the recommended schedule cannot be \nfollowed exactly, the interval between the first two doses should be approximately two months and the \ninterval between the second and third dose should be as close as possible to eight to eleven months.  \nAll three doses must be administered to complete the vaccination regimen. \n \nChildren who receive one dose of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth may be administered \nPROCOMVAX on the schedule of 2, 4, and 12 -15 months of age. \n \nChildren not vaccinated according to recommended schedule \nVaccination schedules for children not vaccinated according to the recommended schedule should be \nconsidered on an individual basis. \n \nPROCOMVAX  must be injected into the muscle of the thigh. \nDo not inject intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously \n \nIf you forget to take PROCOMVAX: \nYour doctor will decide when to give the missed dose. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner \n\nau\ntho\n\nris\ned\n\n18 \n\n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, PROCOMVAX can have side effects. PROCOMVAX has been generally well \ntolerated in clinical trials.  Side effects include injection-site reactions such as pain, soreness, redness, \nand swelling.  Other side effects include irritability, sleepiness, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of \nappetite, middle ear infection, and unusual high-pitched crying. Other side effects that may occur \nrarely and be serious include seizure, febrile seizure, allergic reactions, allergic swelling (angioedema) \nand certain severe types of rash, injection site nodule. \n \nTell your doctor promptly about these or any other unusual symptoms. If the condition persists or \nworsens, seek medical attention. \n \nIn addition, tell your doctor if your child experienced any symptoms that suggest an allergic reaction \nafter any dose in the vaccination series. \n \nIf you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5.  STORING PROCOMVAX \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C - 8 °C). \nDo not freeze. \nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the label. \n \n \n6.
