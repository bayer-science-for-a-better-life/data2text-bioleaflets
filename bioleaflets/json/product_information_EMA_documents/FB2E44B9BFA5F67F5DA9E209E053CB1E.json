This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFotivda 890 microgram hard capsules \nFotivda 1340 microgram hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nFotivda 890 microgram hard capsules \nEach hard capsule contains tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate equivalent to 890 microgram \ntivozanib. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nEach hard capsule contains trace amounts of tartrazine (E102) (8-12% of the yellow printing ink \ncomposition) (see section 4.4). \n \nFotivda 1340 microgram hard capsules \nEach hard capsule contains tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate equivalent to 1340 microgram \ntivozanib.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \nFotivda 890 microgram hard capsules \nHard capsule with dark blue opaque cap and bright yellow opaque body, printed with yellow ink \n“TIVZ” on the cap and with dark blue ink “LD” on the body. \n \nFotivda 1340 microgram hard capsules \nHard capsule with bright yellow opaque cap and bright yellow opaque body, printed with dark blue \nink “TIVZ” on the cap and with dark blue ink “SD” on the body. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFotivda is indicated for the first line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma \n(RCC) and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease \nprogression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFotivda should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of tivozanib is 1340 microgram once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day \nrest period to comprise one complete treatment cycle of 4 weeks.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThis treatment schedule should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nNo more than one dose of Fotivda must be taken per day. \n \nDose modification \nThe occurrence of undesirable effects may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of \ntivozanib therapy (see section 4.4). In the pivotal study, the dose was reduced for grade 3 events and \ninterrupted for grade 4 events. \nWhen dose reduction is necessary, the tivozanib dose can be reduced to 890 microgram once daily \nwith the normal treatment schedule of 21 days of dosing, followed by a 7-day rest period. \n \nMissed dose \nIn the case of a missed dose a replacement dose must not be taken to make up for a forgotten dose. \nThe next dose should be taken at the next scheduled time. \n \nIn the case of vomiting a replacement dose should not be taken; the next dose should be taken at the \nnext scheduled time. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tivozanib in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. There is no relevant use of tivozanib in the paediatric population in \nthe indication advanced renal cell carcinoma. \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nCaution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment due to limited experience and in patients \nundergoing dialysis as there is no experience of tivozanib in this patient population. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nAll patients should have liver function tests evaluated, including aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (AP), to determine hepatic function \nbefore starting and during treatment with tivozanib.  \nTivozanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment should only be treated with one tivozanib 1340 microgram capsule every other day \nas they may be at an increased risk of adverse reactions due to increased exposure with the dose of \n1340 microgram every day (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required when \nadministering tivozanib to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Tivozanib should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment with close monitoring of tolerability.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFotivda is for oral use. \n \nFotivda may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The capsules must be swallowed whole \nwith a glass of water and must not be opened. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCo-administration with herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n(see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypertension \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, hypertension (including persistent severe hypertension) has occurred \n(see section 4.8). In approximately one-third of the patients, hypertension developed within the first \n2 months of treatment. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating tivozanib. During \ntreatment, patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with anti-hypertensive \ntherapy according to standard medical practice. In the case of persistent hypertension despite use of \nanti-hypertensive therapy, the tivozanib dose should be reduced, or the treatment interrupted and \nre-initiated at a lower dose once the blood pressure is controlled, according to clinical judgment (see \nsection 4.2). Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in cases of persistent severe \nhypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (see below), or other complications of \nhypertension. Patients receiving anti-hypertensive medication should still be monitored for \nhypotension when tivozanib is either interrupted or discontinued.  \n \nArterial thromboembolic events \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) have occurred (see section \n4.8). Risk factors for ATE include malignant disease, age > 65 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, \nsmoking, hypercholesterolaemia, and prior thromboembolic disease. Tivozanib has not been studied in \npatients who had an ATE within the preceding 6 months of clinical study initiation. Tivozanib must be \nused with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of these events (such as \nmyocardial infarction, stroke). \n \nVenous thromboembolic events \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been reported including \npulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (see section 4.8). Risk factors for VTEs include major \nsurgery, multiple trauma, prior VTEs, advanced age, obesity, cardiac or respiratory failure, and \nprolonged immobility. Tivozanib has not been studied in patients who had a VTE within the preceding \n6 months of clinical study initiation. Treatment decision, especially in patients who are at risk for \nVTEs, should be based on individual patient benefit/risk assessment. \n \nCardiac failure \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac \nfailure has been reported (see section 4.8). Signs or symptoms of cardiac failure should be periodically \nmonitored throughout treatment with tivozanib. Management of cardiac failure events may require \ntemporary interruption or permanent discontinuation and/or dose reduction of tivozanib therapy, plus \ntreatment of potential underlying causes of cardiac failure e.g. hypertension. \n \nHaemorrhage \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, haemorrhagic events have been reported (see section 4.8). Tivozanib \nmust be used with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of bleeding. If any \nbleeding requires medical intervention, tivozanib should be temporarily interrupted. \n \nProteinuria \nProteinuria has been reported in clinical studies with tivozanib (see section 4.8). Monitoring for \nproteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout treatment is recommended. For patients \nwho develop Grade 2 (> 1.0-3.4 g/24 hours) or Grade 3 (≥ 3.5 g/24 hours) proteinuria (National \nCancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]), the dose of \ntivozanib has to be reduced or the treatment temporarily interrupted. If the patient develops Grade 4 \nproteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) tivozanib has to be discontinued. Risk factors for proteinuria include \nhigh blood pressure. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHepatotoxicity \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, elevations of ALT, AST, and bilirubin have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). The majority of AST and ALT elevations were not accompanied with concomitant \nelevations of bilirubin. AST, ALT, bilirubin, and AP should be monitored before initiation of and \nperiodically throughout treatment with tivozanib because of the potential risk of hepatotoxicity (see \nsection 4.2).  \nTivozanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment should only be treated with one tivozanib 1340 microgram capsule every other day \nas they may be at an increased risk of adverse reactions due to increased exposure with the dose of \n1340 microgram every day (see section 5.2).  No dose adjustment is required when administering \ntivozanib to patients with mild hepatic impairment.  Tivozanib should be used with caution in patients \nwith mild and moderate hepatic impairment with close monitoring of tolerability. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \nIn clinical studies, one case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was confirmed \nafter treatment with tivozanib (see section 4.8). PRES is a neurological disorder which can present \nwith headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. \nMild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is necessary to confirm the \ndiagnosis of PRES. Tivozanib must be discontinued in patients developing signs or symptoms of \nPRES. The safety of re-initiating tivozanib therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not \nknown and tivozanib should only be used with caution in these patients.  \n \nHand foot skin reaction \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, hand foot skin reaction (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) has \nbeen reported. Most events in the five renal cell carcinoma monotherapy studies were CTC \nGrade 1 or 2 (≥ CTC Grade 3 was observed in < 2% of patients treated with tivozanib) and there were \nno serious events (see section 4.8). Management of patients experiencing HFSR may include topical \ntherapies for symptomatic relief with consideration of temporary interruption and/or reduction in \ntreatment dose or, in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation of treatment. \n \nQT interval prolongation \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, QT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported (see section 4.8 and \nsection 5.1). QT/QTc interval prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. \nIt is recommended that tivozanib be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval \nprolongation or other relevant pre-existing cardiac disease and those receiving other medications \nknown to increase the QT interval. Baseline and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and \nmaintenance of electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, potassium) within the normal range is \nrecommended.  \n \nGastrointestinal perforation/fistula \nIt is recommended that symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula should be periodically \nmonitored throughout treatment with tivozanib and that tivozanib should be used with caution in \npatients at risk for GI perforation or fistula. \n \nWound healing complications \nFor precautionary reasons, temporary interruption of tivozanib therapy is recommended in patients \nundergoing major surgical procedures. The decision to resume tivozanib therapy after surgery should \nbe based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. \n \nHypothyroidism \nIn clinical studies with tivozanib, hypothyroidism has been reported (see section 4.8). Hypothyroidism \nhas been observed to occur at any time during treatment with tivozanib, developing as early as within \ntwo months of treatment initiation. Risk factors for hypothyroidism include prior history of \nhypothyroidism and use of anti-thyroid medications. Thyroid function should be monitored before \ninitiation of, and periodically throughout treatment with tivozanib. Hypothyroidism should be treated \naccording to standard medical practice. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nElderly patients \nDysphonia, diarrhoea, fatigue, weight decreased, appetite decreased and hypothyroidism occurred \nmore commonly in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Healthcare professions should be aware that elderly \npatients may be at increased risk of adverse reactions. \n \nTartrazine \nFotivda 890 microgram hard capsules contain tartrazine (E102) which may cause allergic reactions. \n \nAneurysms and artery dissections  \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Fotivda, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nContraindication of concomitant use \nHerbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) are contraindicated.  If a \npatient is already taking St John’s wort, this should be stopped before starting tivozanib treatment. The \ninducing effect of St John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St \nJohn’s wort (see section 4.3). \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inducers \nIn a clinical study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of a single 1340 microgram dose of \ntivozanib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state (rifampin 600 mg once daily) decreased the \naverage half-life of tivozanib from 121 to 54 hours which was associated with a decrease in the single \ndose AUC0-∞ of 48% compared with AUC0-∞ in the absence of rifampin.  Average Cmax and AUC0-24hr \nwere not significantly affected (8% increase and 6% decrease respectively). The clinical effects of \nstrong CYP3A4 inducers on repeated daily dosing of tivozanib has not been studied but potentially the \naverage time to reach steady-state and the average steady-state serum concentration of tivozanib may \nbe reduced, due to the reduction in half-life.  It is recommended that concomitant administration of \ntivozanib with strong CYP3A4 inducers, if used, should be undertaken with caution.   \nModerate CYP3A4 inducers are not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on tivozanib \nexposure.  \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of tivozanib with a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg once daily), had no influence on tivozanib serum concentrations (Cmax \nor AUC); therefore, tivozanib exposure is unlikely to be altered by CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n \nMedicinal products for which intestinal absorption is restricted by BCRP \nTivozanib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding is \nunknown (see section 5.2).  Caution should be exercised if tivozanib is co-administered with \nrosuvastatin. Alternatively, a statin not subject to restriction of intestinal absorption by BCRP should \nbe considered. Patients taking an oral BCRP substrate with a clinically-relevant efflux interaction in \nthe gut should ensure that a suitable time window (e.g. 2 hours) is applied between administration of \ntivozanib and the BCRP substrate. \n \nContraceptives \nIt is currently unknown whether tivozanib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, \nand therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see section 4.6). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while on tivozanib. Female partners \nof male patients taking tivozanib should also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of contraception \nshould be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at least one \n\n\n\n7 \n\nmonth after completing therapy. It is currently unknown whether tivozanib may reduce the \neffectiveness of hormonal contraceptives and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should \nadd a barrier method. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of tivozanib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nTivozanib should not be used during pregnancy. If tivozanib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient \nbecomes pregnant while receiving tivozanib, the potential hazard to the foetus must be explained to \nthe patient. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether tivozanib is excreted in human milk, but the potential exists. Because of the \npotential for tivozanib-mediated adverse reactions in breastfed infants, women should not breast-feed \nwhile taking tivozanib. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies indicate that male and female fertility may be affected by treatment with tivozanib (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTivozanib may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nadvised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience asthenia, fatigue, and/or \ndizziness during treatment with tivozanib (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nPooled data of 674 patients with advanced RCC who continued to receive tivozanib as their initial on \ntrial therapy in the five core RCC monotherapy studies have been evaluated in the overall assessment \nof safety and tolerability of tivozanib. \n \nThe most important serious adverse reaction is hypertension. \nThe most common adverse reactions of any grade include hypertension (47.6%), dysphonia \n(26.9%), fatigue (25.8%) and diarrhoea (25.5%). \n \nIn the five core RCC monotherapy studies tivozanib was discontinued in a total of 20 patients (3%) \nowing to adverse reactions, most commonly due to hypertension (0.4%), persistent severe \nhypertension (0.3%), or acute myocardial infarction (0.3%). The most frequent adverse reactions \nleading to tivozanib dose reduction/ interruption were hypertension (4.7%), diarrhoea (3.1%), fatigue \n(1.8%). \nIn patients receiving tivozanib as initial therapy, there were three adverse reactions with outcome \ndeath; one was uncontrolled hypertension in the setting of a suspected overdose (see section 4.9) and \ntwo were reported simply as death. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions occurring in patients who continued to receive tivozanib as their initial on trial \ntherapy in the five RCC monotherapy studies were pooled and are listed below by MedDRA body \nsystem organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each SOC, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1: Tabulated list of adverse reactions (presented using frequencies for all-causality \nadverse events) \n \n\nSystem \nOrgan \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  \nFungal infection \n\nPustular rash \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \n\nsystem disorders \n\n \nAnaemia Thrombocytopenia \n\nHaemoglobin \nincreased \n\n  \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n \nHypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism \n\nGoitre1 \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\nDecreased appetite Anorexia    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n \nInsomnia    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Peripheral \nneuropathy2 \n\nDizziness \n\nDysgeusia3 \n\nTransient \nischaemic attack \n\nMemory \nimpairment4 \n\nPosterior \nreversible \n\nencephalopathy \nsyndrome (PRES)5 \n\n \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nVision impairment6 Increased \nlacrimation \n\n  \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n \nVertigo \n\nTinnitus \n\nEar congestion   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n \nMyocardial \n\ninfarction (acute) / \nischaemia7 \n\nAngina pectoris \n\nTachycardia8 \n\nPulmonary oedema \n\nCoronary artery \ninsufficiency \n\nElectrocardiogram \nQT prolonged \n\n  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nHypertension Haemorrhage9 \n\nArterial \nthromboembolism10 \n\nVenous \nthromboembolism11 \n\nPersistent severe \nhypertension12 \n\nFlushing13 \n\n  Aneurysms and \nartery \n\ndissections \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \n\nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea14 \n\nDysphonia \n\nCough \n\nEpistaxis \n\nRhinorrhoea \n\nNasal congestion \n\n   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem \nOrgan \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nAbdominal pain15 \n\nNausea \n\nDiarrhoea \n\nStomatitis16 \n\nPancreatitis17 \n\nDysphagia18 \n\nVomiting \n\nGastrooesophageal \nreflux disease \n\nAbdominal \ndistension \n\nGlossitis19 \n\nGingivitis20 \n\nDyspepsia \n\nConstipation \n\nDry mouth \n\nFlatulence \n\nDuodenal ulcer   \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n \nALT increased / \nAST increased21 \n\nGamma-\nglutamyltransferase \n\nincreased \n\nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \n\nincreased \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nPalmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia \nsyndrome / Hand \nfoot skin reaction \n\n(PPE/HFS) \n\nSkin exfoliation \n\nErythema22 \n\nPruritus23 \n\nAlopecia \n\nRash24 \n\nAcne25 \n\nDry skin \n\nUrticaria \n\nDermatitis26 \n\nHyperhidrosis \n\nXeroderma \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand \n\nconnective \ntissue \n\ndisorders \n\nBack pain Arthralgia \n\nMyalgia \n\nMusculoskeletal \nchest pain \n\nMuscular \nweakness \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \n\ndisorders \n\n \nProteinuria \n\nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n\n   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \n\nadministration   \nsite \n\nconditions \n\nPain27 \n\nAsthenia \n\nFatigue \n\nChest pain28 \n\nChills29 \n\nPyrexia \n\nPeripheral oedema \n\nMucosal \ninflammation \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem \nOrgan \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Not known \n\nInvestigations Weight decreased Amylase increased \n\nLipase increased \n\nBlood thyroid \nstimulating \n\nhormone increased \n\n   \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies are presented using frequencies for all-causality adverse events. \nThe following terms have been combined:  \n1 Goitre including goitre and toxic nodular goitre \n2 Peripheral neuropathy including hyperaesthesia, hypoaesthesia, mononeuropathy, neuropathy peripheral, peripheral \n\nsensory neuropathy and paraesthesia \n3 Dysgeusia including ageusia, dysgeusia and hypogeusia  \n4 Memory impairment including amnesia and memory impairment  \n5 PRES was not observed in patients treated with tivozanib in the five RCC monotherapy studies.

Persistent severe hypertension (‘hypertensive \ncrisis’) was an adverse reaction in 1.0%, CTC Grade 3 or higher in 0.9%. One patient died as a result \nof uncontrolled hypertension in the setting of a suspected overdose. \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \nPRES (also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)) was confirmed in \none non-RCC patient after approximately 8 weeks on tivozanib. PRES is a neurological disorder that \nmay present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic \ndisturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nVenous thromboembolism \nPulmonary embolism was reported in patients (0.7%) receiving tivozanib as initial therapy in the five \ncore RCC monotherapy studies, with the majority CTC Grade ≥ 3 (see section 4.4). Deep vein \nthrombosis was also reported in two patients (0.3%) and was CTC Grade ≥ 3 in one patient (0.1%) \nreceiving initial tivozanib therapy.   \n \nArterial thromboembolic events \nArterial thromboembolic adverse reactions in the patients receiving tivozanib as initial therapy were \nischaemic stroke (1.0%), myocardial infarction (0.7%), transient ischaemic attack (0.7%) and acute \nmyocardial infarction (0.4%), the majority of which were at least CTC Grade 3, plus iliac artery \nthrombosis (0.1%). There were no deaths due to arterial thromboembolic adverse reactions in those \nreceiving tivozanib as initial therapy but a myocardial infarction in a patient receiving second-line \ntivozanib had a fatal outcome. \n \nCardiac failure \nPulmonary oedema was reported in two patients (0.3%) receiving tivozanib as initial therapy in the \nfive core RCC monotherapy studies. Both events were CTC Grade 3 (see section 4.4). \n \nQT/QTc prolongation \nQT prolongation was reported in two patients (CTC Grade 2 and Grade 3) in the tivozanib cardiac \nsafety study, neither reaction was considered serious (see section 4.4 and section 5.1). \n \nHypothyroidism \nHypothyroidism was reported as an adverse reaction for 5.6% of patients during initial therapy and \nwas CTC Grade 2 or lower in all cases. It was reported as serious in one patient. \n \nHaemorrhage \nHaemorrhage adverse reactions were reported in the core monotherapy studies during initial treatment \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nTwo patients received excessive doses of tivozanib during the monotherapy studies.  A patient with a \nhistory of hypertension experienced aggravated uncontrolled hypertension that was fatal after taking \n3 doses of 1340 microgram tivozanib in one day (total 4020 microgram).  No adverse reaction was \nexperienced by the second patient who took 2 doses of 1340 microgram tivozanib in one day (total \n2680 microgram).   \nBlood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating tivozanib and patients should be monitored \nfor hypertension during treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nIn cases of suspected overdose, tivozanib should be discontinued and the patient monitored for \nhypertension and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. \nThere is no specific treatment or antidote for tivozanib overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein-kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE34  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nMechanism of action  \n \nTivozanib potently and selectively blocks all 3 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptors \n(VEGFR) and has been shown to block various VEGF-induced biochemical and biologic responses in \nvitro, including VEGF-ligand-induced phosphorylation of all three VEGFR 1, 2 and 3, and \nproliferation of human endothelial cells. The next most potently inhibited kinase is c-kit which is \n8-fold less sensitive to inhibition by tivozanib compared to VEGFR 1, 2 and 3. VEGF is a potent \nmitogenic factor that plays a central role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability of tumour tissues. \nBy blocking VEGF-induced VEGFR activation, tivozanib inhibits angiogenesis and vascular \npermeability in tumour tissues, leading to inhibition of tumour growth in vivo.  \n  \nClinical efficacy  \n \nThe efficacy of tivozanib in the treatment of advanced RCC was studied in the following randomised \nclinical study. \n \nStudy AV-951-09-301 \nThis controlled clinical study was a Phase 3 multi-centre, open-label, international, randomised study \ncomparing tivozanib with sorafenib in patients with advanced RCC. Five hundred and seventeen (517) \npatients with recurrent or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component were randomised (1:1) to \nreceive either tivozanib 1340 microgram once daily on a schedule of 3 weeks on treatment followed \nby 1 week off (schedule 3/1) or sorafenib 400 mg twice a day. The study included patients who had all \nundergone prior nephrectomy, and who had received either no prior therapy or no more than one prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting (immunotherapy/chemotherapy); prior treatment with VEGF \nor mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) targeted therapy was not allowed. Cross-over to the \ntivozanib arm was permitted upon Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST)-defined \nprogression on sorafenib according to the protocol of a separate extension study.  \nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent \nradiology review; key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate \n(ORR) by independent radiology review.  \nThe intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 517 patients, 260 randomised to tivozanib and \n257 randomised to sorafenib. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally \nwell balanced across the tivozanib and sorafenib arms with regard to age (mean age 58.2 vs 58.4 years \nrespectively), gender (71.2% vs 73.5% male respectively), race (95.8% vs 96.9% white respectively), \ngeographic region (88.1% vs 88.7% from Central/Eastern Europe respectively) and prior treatment for \nmetastatic RCC (69.6% vs 70.8% treatment naïve respectively). For the 30% of patients receiving \nprior treatment, the predominant therapy was interferon alpha as monotherapy which was received by \n75 patients in the tivozanib arm and 62 patients in the sorafenib arm.  \nTivozanib showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS and ORR over sorafenib by \nindependent radiology review (Table 2 and Figure 1).  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nFigure 1:  Kaplan-Meier plot of progression free survival, independent radiological review \n(ITT Population) \n\n \n\n \n \nTable 2: Efficacy analysis by independent radiology review (ITT population) \n \n\n Tivozanib Sorafenib \n \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\nP-value \n(Log rank \n\ntest) \nProgression-Free Survival \n[median, months \n(95% CI)], ITT \nPopulation  \n\nN=260 11.9 \n(9.3, 14.7) \n\nN=257 9.1 \n(7.3, 9.5) \n\n0.797 \n(0.639, 0.993)a \n\n0.042b \n\nObjective Response Rate \n(95% CI), ITT Population  \n\nN=260 33.1% \n(27.4, 39.2) \n\nN=257 23.3% \n(18.3, 29.0) \n\n 0.014c \n\nProgression-Free \nSurvival, No prior \ntreatment for Metastatic \nRCC Subgroup [median, \nmonths (95% CI)]  \n\nN=181 12.7 \n(9.1, 15.0) \n\nN=181 9.1 \n(7.3, 10.8) \n\n0.756 \n(0.580, 0.985)d \n\n0.037e \n\nProgression-Free \nSurvival, One Prior \nTherapy for Metastatic \nDisease Subgroup \n[median, months \n(95% CI)]  \n\nN=78 11.9 \n(8.0, 16.6) \n\nN=76 9.1 \n(7.2, 11.1) \n\n0.877 \n(0.587, 1.309)d \n\n0.520e \n\na Hazard ratio for tivozanib arm vs. sorafenib arm, based on stratified Cox proportional hazards model. \nStratification factors are number of prior treatments (0 or 1) and number of metastatic sites/organs involved \n(1 or ≥2).

In the ITT population there was a small numerical difference \n\n\n\n14 \n\nbetween the two arms in terms of overall survival.  median OS was 28.2 months (95% CI 22.5, 33.0) \nin the tivozanib arm compared to 30.8 months (95% CI 28.4, 33.3) in the sorafenib arm (HR=1.147, \np=0.276).  \n \nElderly patients \nIn a controlled clinical study (AV-951-09-301), in which 25% of patients receiving tivozanib were \n≥ 65 years of age, no overall differences was observed in efficacy between elderly and younger \npatients (see section 4.2).  \nIn the core RCC studies some adverse reaction occurred more commonly in the elderly (see section \n4.4). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn a cardiac safety study of 50 patients with advanced solid tumours treated with tivozanib at \n1340 microgram daily for 21 days, the mean change from baseline in QTcF was 6.8 ms on day 21 of \ndosing. The maximum change in QTcF from baseline was 9.3 ms (90% CI: 5, 13.6), which occurred \n2.5 hours after dosing on Day 21. The central tendency change for all measured days and across all \ntime points was 2.2 ms. No subjects had a new > 500 ms change in QTcF; 2 patients (4%) had QTcF \nvalues > 480 ms. One subject (2%) had a > 60 ms change from baseline in QTcF and 6 subjects (12%) \nhad a 30 ms to 60 ms change from baseline (see section 4.4 and section 4.8).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntivozanib in all subsets of the paediatric population in advanced renal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration of tivozanib, peak serum levels are achieved after approximately 2 to \n24 hours. After a single 1340 microgram dose, mean Cmax was 10.2 to 25.2 ng/mL across healthy \nsubject and patient studies. Single dose AUC0-inf for healthy volunteers dosed with 1340 microgram \ntivozanib was 1,950 to 2,491 ng.hr/mL. After once daily dosing of 1340 microgram tivozanib for 21 or \n28 days in RCC patients, Cmax was 67.5 to 94.3 ng/mL and AUC0-24 was 1,180 to 1,641 ng.hr/mL. \nExposure is dose proportional between 890 and 1340 microgram and dose related over the wider range \nof 450 mg and 1790 microgram.  Accumulation at steady-state is approximately 6- to 7- fold the \nexposure observed at single-dose levels.  Clearance is similar between acute and chronic dosing \nindicating no time dependent changes in PK.   \n \nWhen tivozanib was evaluated in a food effect study in healthy subjects, a high fat meal decreased the \npeak serum concentrations (Cmax) by 23.4% compared to the fasted state. There was no effect of food \non the overall exposure (AUC). Based on these data, tivozanib can be dosed with or without food (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \nIn vitro protein binding studies have shown that tivozanib is > 99% bound to plasma proteins. No \nconcentration dependence of plasma protein binding was observed over the range of 0.1 to 5 µmol/L \ntivozanib. Albumin is the major tivozanib binding component in human plasma. In vitro studies have \nshown that tivozanib is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump, \nP-glycoprotein. In vitro studies suggest that tivozanib is an inhibitor of intestinal BCRP. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro metabolism studies have shown that CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 are capable of metabolising \ntivozanib. Unchanged tivozanib is the major circulating form of the molecule, and there were no major \nmetabolites detected in serum at exposure equal to or greater than 10% of the total radioactivity \nexposure. As CYP1A1 is primarily expressed in extrahepatic tissues such as the lung and intestine, it \nwas considered unlikely that this isoform would be extensively involved in hepatic metabolism. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that metabolites of tivozanib can undergo UGT mediated \nbiotransformation via the UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 \npathways. Direct N-glucoronidation of tivozanib was a minor pathway of metabolism in vitro. \n \nElimination \nAfter chronic dosing of tivozanib in RCC patients for 21 days followed by 7 days without \nadministration of tivozanib, tivozanib Cmin is approximately 16.0 to 30.9 ng/mL. \nIn studies that evaluated the terminal elimination phase, tivozanib had a mean t½ of 4.5 - 5.1 days. \nAfter a single dose oral dose of [14C] tivozanib, approximately 79% of the radioactivity was recovered \nin the faeces and approximately 12% was found in the urine as metabolites. There was no unchanged \ntivozanib recovered in the urine indicating that tivozanib does not undergo renal excretion.  [14C] \nTivozanib was the predominant drug-related material in faeces. There were no [14C]-containing \nmetabolites present in faeces at greater than 10% of the dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge, gender and race \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender \nor race on the pharmacokinetics of tivozanib. \n \nHepatic impairment \nResults from a single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of tivozanib \nin subjects with hepatic impairment show that across the entire measurement period, tivozanib was \neliminated more slowly in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class \nC) hepatic impairment. Tivozanib exposure was increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(mean AUC0-∞ by 4.0-fold) and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (mean \nAUC0-∞ by 2.6-fold).  No significant increase in exposure was observed in patients with mild \n(Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment (mean AUC0-∞ by 1.2-fold). Tivozanib should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and the dose reduced to one 1340 microgram \ncapsule every other day.  Tivozanib should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.2 and section 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \nClinical studies with tivozanib were conducted in RCC patients with serum creatinine concentration \n≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal, including those who may have had a prior nephrectomy. Although \nthe impact of further impairment of renal function on the overall disposition of tivozanib is unknown, \na clinical study has shown that no unchanged tivozanib is excreted in the urine indicating that \ntivozanib does not undergo renal excretion.. According to the population pharmacokinetic analysis of \ntivozanib exposure, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nExperience of tivozanib use in patients with severe renal impairment is limited and caution is advised.  \n \nCYP and UGT in vitro studies \nIn vitro studies with tivozanib indicate that it is not a CYP enzyme inducer. In vitro studies conducted \nin human liver microsomes and hepatocytes evaluating the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2A6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 suggested that tivozanib is a weak inhibitor of \nCYP2B6 and CYP2C8.  Based on the in vitro IC50 and in vivo unbound Cmax, tivozanib was unlikely to \ninteract in a clinically relevant manner with active substances that are metabolised by these enzyme \npathways.  \n \nStudies conducted in vitro have shown that tivozanib is not a potent inhibitor of UGT \n(UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) metabolic activities and clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are \nunlikely with medicinal products metabolised by these pathways. \n \nTransporter in vitro studies \nIn vitro studies have shown that tivozanib is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of the transporter proteins \nMDR1 (P-gp), OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP.  Furthermore, tivozanib was not an in vitro \ninhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K or substrate of MRP2 and BCRP. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTivozanib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, at concentrations that are likely to restrict the \neffect to intestinal BCRP activity in vivo.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows. \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, abnormalities were noted in growing incisors (thin brittle teeth, \ntooth loss, malocclusions) at doses approximately 2-fold greater than the calculated human equivalent \ndose and growth plate hypertrophy was observed at doses approximately 0.7- to 7-fold greater than the \ncalculated human equivalent dose. Tivozanib was shown to cause growth plate hypertrophy, absence \nof active corpora lutea and no maturing follicles in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels that produced \nexposures equivalent to those seen at the recommended clinical dose.  \n \nReproduction, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility \nTivozanib may impair human fertility. In nonclinical studies assessing mating and fertility parameters \nin male rats, doses > 2-fold higher than the recommended clinical dose, produced increased \nepididymis and testis weights associated with infertility. Increased testis weights were observed at a \ndose 7-fold higher than the recommended clinical dose.  In female rats, an increase in non-viable \nfoetuses was noted at a dose 0.7-fold the recommended clinical dose, while dose levels ≥ 2 fold the \nrecommended clinical dose produced infertility. \n \nTivozanib was shown to be teratogenic, embryotoxic and foetotoxic in pregnant rats at dose levels \n5 times lower than the recommended clinical dose (based on a 60 kg human). Studies in pregnant \nrabbits showed no effect on maternal health or embryo foetal development at doses approximately \n0.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. \n \nCarcinogenesis \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with tivozanib.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nFotivda 890 microgram hard capsules \nFotivda 1340 microgram hard capsules \n\ntivozanib \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.  \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Fotivda is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Fotivda  \n3. How to take Fotivda  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Fotivda  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fotivda is and what it is used for  \n \nThe active substance in Fotivda is tivozanib, which is a protein kinase inhibitor. Tivozanib reduces the \nsupply of blood to the cancer, which slows down the growth and spread of cancer cells. It works by \nblocking the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Blocking the action \nof VEGF prevents the formation of new blood vessels. \n \nFotivda is used to treat adults with advanced kidney cancer. It is used where other treatments such as \ninterferon-alpha or interleukin-2 have either not yet been used or have not helped to stop your disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Fotivda  \n \nDo not take Fotivda:  \n• If you are allergic to tivozanib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6);  \n• If you are taking St. John’s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used \n\nfor treatment of depression and anxiety). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Fotivda:  \n• if you have high blood pressure. \n\nFotivda can increase your blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure \nregularly and, if it is too high, may either give you a medicine to lower it, or reduce your dose of \nFotivda. However, if your blood pressure remains too high, your doctor may decide to interrupt \nor to stop treatment with Fotivda. If you are already taking a medicine to treat high blood \npressure, and your doctor reduces the dose of Fotivda or interrupts or stops treatment, you will \nbe regularly checked for low blood pressure.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n• if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a \n\ntear in a blood vessel wall. \n \n\n• if you have had problems with blood clots.  \nTreatment with Fotivda may raise the risk of developing a blood clot (thrombus) in your blood \nvessels that could break loose and be carried by the blood stream to block another blood vessel.  \nTell your doctor if you have ever had one of the following:  \no a blood clot in your lungs (with cough, chest pain, sudden shortness of breath or coughing \n\nup blood),  \no blood clot in your legs or arms, eye, or brain (with pain or swelling in your hands or feet, \n\nreduced vision, or changes in your mental state) \no a stroke, or signs and symptoms of a ‘mini-stroke’ (transient ischaemic attack) \no a heart attack \no high blood pressure \no diabetes \no major surgery \no multiple injuries such as broken bones and damage to internal organs \no inability to move for a long period \no heart failure which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling \no inability to breathe, bluish colour on your skin, fingertips or lips, restlessness, anxiety, \n\nconfusion, altered consciousness or sense of awareness, rapid, shallow breathing, a racing \nheart or excessive sweating.  \n\n \n• if you suffer or have suffered from any of these symptoms or are treated for heart failure: \n\no Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) when you exert yourself or when you lie down \no Feeling weak and tired \no Swelling (oedema) in your legs, ankles and feet \no Reduced ability to exercise \no Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged phlegm \nSigns and symptoms of heart failure will be monitored whilst you are taking your medicine. If \nnecessary, your doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or stop this treatment. \n \n\n• If you have or are treated for an abnormal rate and rhythm of the heartbeat (arrhythmia). \nYour doctor will monitor the effect of Fotivda on your heart by recording the electrical activity \nof your heart (an electrocardiogram) or by measuring your blood calcium, magnesium and \npotassium levels during your treatment.  \n \n\n• if you have problems with your liver.  \nYour doctor will regularly monitor how well your liver is working before and during treatment \nwith Fotivda (e.g. with blood tests), and if necessary may need to reduce how often you take \nFotivda.  \n\n \n• if you have problems with your thyroid gland or use medicines to treat thyroid disease. \n\nTreatment with Fotivda may cause your thyroid gland to work less well than usual. Your doctor \nwill regularly monitor how well your thyroid gland is working before and during treatment with \nFotivda (e.g. with blood tests).  \n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse while taking Fotivda:  \n• if you get shortness of breath or ankle swelling \n\nTell your doctor right away as these may be symptoms of heart failure. Your doctor will \nmonitor this, and depending on the severity may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or \nstop treatment with Fotivda. \n\n \n• if you have had problems with bleeding \n\nTreatment with Fotivda may increase the risk of bleeding. If you get bleeding problems (with \npainful swollen stomach (abdomen), vomiting blood, coughing up blood, black stools, blood in \n\n\n\n34 \n\nyour urine, headache or changes in your mental state), tell your doctor right away. Treatment \nwith Fotivda may need to be temporarily stopped.  \n\n \n• if laboratory tests show that there is protein in your urine  \n\nYour doctor will monitor this at the beginning and during your treatment.  Depending on the \nresults, your doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or stop this treatment. \n\n \n• if you suffer from a disease of the brain, called posterior reversible encephalopathy \n\nsyndrome (PRES) \nTell your doctor right away if you have symptoms such as headache, seizure (fit), lack of energy, \nconfusion, blindness or other visual and neurologic disturbances such as weakness in an arm or \na leg. If PRES is diagnosed, your doctor will stop treatment with Fotivda.  \n\n \n• if the skin on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet become dry, cracked, \n\nscaling, or peeling, or is stinging or tingling \nThese may be symptoms of a condition called hand foot skin reaction. Your doctor will treat the \ncondition and, depending on the severity, the doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or \ninterrupt or stop this treatment. \n\n \n• if you have symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation (developing a hole \n\nin the stomach or intestine or abnormal passages forming between parts of the intestine) such as \nsevere stomach pain, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting or painful bowel obstruction, diarrhoea or \nrectal bleeding.  \nYour doctor will regularly monitor you for these symptoms during your treatment with Fotivda. \n\n \n• if you need to have an operation or another form of surgery \n\nYour doctor may recommend that you temporarily stop taking Fotivda if you have an operation \nor surgery, as it could affect wound healing.  \n\n \nThe printing ink used on the Fotivda 890 microgram capsule contains tartrazine (E102), which may \ncause allergic reactions.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nDo not give Fotivda to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine has not been \nstudied in children and adolescents.  \n \nOther medicines and Fotivda  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you have bought without a \nprescription.  \n \nFotivda may work less well when taken with some medicines.  Tell your doctor if you are taking any \nof the following medicines; they may decide to change your medication: \n• dexamethasone (a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and treat disorders of the immune \n\nsystem); \n• rosuvastatin (a medicine used to help lower cholesterol levels in your blood); \n• phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy); \n• nafcillin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentin (antibiotics); \n• St. John’s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for treatment of \n\ndepression and anxiety) as this herbal remedy should not be used at the same time as Fotivda. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n• Do not take Fotivda if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor who will discuss with you the risks \n\nof taking Fotivda to you and your child. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n• Both you and your partner must use effective contraception.  If you or your partner are taking \nhormonal contraceptives (the pill, an implant or patch) you must use an additional barrier \nmethod throughout treatment and for another month after completing treatment. \n\n \n• Do not breast-feed during treatment with Fotivda, as it is not known whether the active \n\ningredient in Fotivda passes into breast-milk. Talk to your doctor if you are already breast-\nfeeding. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor when planning a baby, as Fotivda may affect the fertility of men and \n\nwomen. \n \nDriving and using machines \nFotivda can have side effects that may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving or \nusing machines if you feel weak, tired, or dizzy. See also Section 4 “Possible side effects”. \n \n \n3. How to take Fotivda \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose \nThe recommended dose is one Fotivda 1340 microgram capsule, taken once daily for 21 days \n(3 weeks), followed by a 7-day (1-week) period when no capsules are taken.  \nThis schedule is repeated in cycles of 4 weeks.  \n\n \n\n \n \nYour doctor will check you regularly, and you will normally continue to take Fotivda as long as it is \nworking, and you do not suffer unacceptable side effects. \n \nReduced dose \nIn case you experience severe side effects, your doctor may decide to interrupt Fotivda therapy and/or \nlower the dose to: \nOne Fotivda 890 microgram capsule, taken once daily for 21 days (3 weeks), followed by a 7-day \n(1-week) period when no capsules are taken. \nThis schedule is repeated in cycles of 4 weeks.  \n \nLiver problems \nIf you have liver problems, your doctor may reduce how often you take your dose to every other day \n(i.e. one 1340 microgram capsule every other day). \n \nTaking with food and drink \nFotivda must be taken with a glass of water and can be taken either with or without food. Swallow the \ncapsule whole. Do not chew, dissolve or open the capsule before swallowing.  \n \nIf you take more Fotivda than you should \nTell your doctor straightaway if you have taken more than your prescribed dose of 1 capsule per day.  \n\n21 days (three weeks) \n \n\nOne Fotivda capsule \ntaken once daily \n\n7 days (1 week) \n \n\nNo capsules are taken \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTaking too much Fotivda makes side effects more likely or to become more severe, especially high \nblood pressure. Get medical help straightaway if you experience confusion, changes in your mental \nstate or headaches. These are all symptoms of high blood pressure. \n \nIf you forget to take Fotivda \nIf you have missed taking a capsule do not take a replacement capsule. Continue to take your next \ndose at the usual time. \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you vomit after taking Fotivda, do not take a replacement capsule. Continue to take your next dose \nat the usual time.  \n \nIf you stop taking Fotivda  \nDo not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop taking the capsules your \ncondition may get worse. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \n \nHigh blood pressure is the most serious and a very common side effect (see also in section 2 \n“Warnings and Precautions”). \nTell your doctor immediately if you think you have high blood pressure.
