NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nTorisel 30 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach vial of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 30 mg temsirolimus. \n \nAfter first dilution of the concentrate with 1.8 ml of solvent, the concentration of temsirolimus is \n10 mg/ml (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \n1 vial of concentrate contains 474 mg of anhydrous ethanol  \n1.8 ml of the solvent provided contains 358 mg anhydrous ethanol \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nConcentrate and solvent for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nThe concentrate is a clear, colourless to light-yellow solution, free from visible particulates. \n \nThe solvent is a clear to slightly turbid, light-yellow to yellow solution, free from visible particulates. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRenal cell carcinoma \n \nTorisel is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma \n(RCC) who have at least three of six prognostic risk factors (see section 5.1). \n \nMantle cell lymphoma \n \nTorisel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell \nlymphoma (MCL) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nuse of antineoplastic medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nPatients should be given intravenous diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg (or similar antihistamine) \napproximately 30 minutes before the start of each dose of temsirolimus (see section 4.4). \n \nTreatment with Torisel should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from therapy \nor until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n\n\n 3\n\n \nRenal cell carcinoma \nThe recommended dose of temsirolimus for advanced RCC is 25 mg administered by intravenous \ninfusion over a 30- to 60-minute period once a week. \n \nTreatment of suspected adverse reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of \ntemsirolimus therapy. If a suspected reaction is not manageable with dose delays, then temsirolimus \nmay be reduced by 5 mg/week decrements. \n \nMantle cell lymphoma \nThe recommended dosing regimen of temsirolimus for MCL is 175 mg, infused over a 30-60 minute \nperiod once a week for 3 weeks followed by weekly doses of 75 mg, infused over a 30-60 minute \nperiod. The starting dose of 175 mg was associated with a significant incidence of adverse events and \nrequired dose reductions/delays in the majority of patients. The contribution of the initial 175 mg \ndoses to the efficacy outcome is currently not known. \n \nTreatment of suspected adverse reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of \ntemsirolimus therapy according to the guidelines in the following tables. If a suspected reaction is not \nmanageable with dose delays and/or optimal medical therapy, then the dose of temsirolimus should be \nreduced according to the dose reduction table below. \n \n\nDose reduction levels \n\nDose reduction level \nStarting dose \n\n175 mg  \nContinuing dosea \n\n75 mg \n-1 75 mg 50 mg \n-2 50 mg 25 mg \n\na In the MCL clinical trial, up to two dose level reductions were allowed per patient. \n \n\nTemsirolimus dose modifications based on weekly ANC and platelet counts \nANC Platelets Dose of temsirolimus \n\n\uf0b31.0 x 109/l \uf0b350 x 109/l 100% of planned dose \n\n\uf03c1.0 x 109/l \uf03c50 x 109/l Holda \na Upon recovery to ANC \uf0b31.0 x 109/l (1000 cells/mm3) and platelets to \uf0b350 x 109/l \n(50,000 cells/mm3), the doses should be modified to the next lower dose level according to the table \nabove. If the patient cannot maintain ANC \uf03e1.0 x 109/l and platelets \uf03e50 x 109/l on the new dose \nreduction level, then the next lower dose should be given once the counts have recovered. \nAbbreviation: ANC = absolute neutrophil count. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nNo specific dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment. Temsirolimus should be used \nwith caution in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTemsirolimus should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with advanced -RCC and mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. For patients with RCC and severe hepatic impairment, the recommended dose for patients \nwho have baseline platelets \uf0b3100 x 109/l is 10 mg intravenous once a week infused over a 30-60 \nminute period (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n 4\n\n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with MCL and mild hepatic impairment. \nTemsirolimus should not be used in patients with MCL and moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of temsirolimus in the paediatric population for the indications of RCC and \nMCL. \n \nTemsirolimus should not be used in the paediatric population for the treatment of neuroblastoma, \nrhabdomyosarcoma or high-grade glioma, because of efficacy concerns based on the available data \n(see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTorisel is for intravenous use only. The diluted solution must be administered by intravenous infusion. \n \nThe vial of concentrate must first be diluted with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent to achieve a \nconcentration of temsirolimus of 10 mg/ml. The required amount of the temsirolimus-solvent mixture \n(10 mg/ml) must be withdrawn and then rapidly injected into sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \nfor injection. \n \nFor instructions on dilution and preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section \n6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to temsirolimus, its metabolites (including sirolimus), polysorbate 80, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nUse of temsirolimus in patients with MCL with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse events is dose-dependent. Patients receiving the starting dose of \n175 mg weekly for the treatment of MCL must be followed closely to decide on dose \nreductions/delays. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nTemsirolimus is not recommended for use in paediatric patients (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nElderly \n \nBased on the results of a Phase 3 study in RCC, elderly patients (\uf0b365 years of age) may be more likely \nto experience certain adverse reactions, including oedema, diarrhoea, and pneumonia. Based on the \nresults of a Phase 3 study in MCL, elderly patients (\uf0b365 years of age) may be more likely to \nexperience certain adverse reactions, including pleural effusion, anxiety, depression, insomnia, \ndyspnoea, leukopenia, lymphopenia, myalgia, arthralgia, taste loss, dizziness, upper respiratory \ninfection, mucositis, and rhinitis. \n \n\n\n\n 5\n\nRenal impairment/renal failure \n \nTemsirolimus elimination by the kidneys is negligible; studies in patients with varying renal \nimpairment have not been conducted (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Temsirolimus has not been studied in \npatients undergoing haemodialysis. \n \nRenal failure (including fatal outcomes) has been observed in patients receiving temsirolimus for \nadvanced RCC and/or with pre-existing renal insufficiency (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nCaution should be used when treating patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nTemsirolimus is cleared predominantly by the liver. In an open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study in \n110 subjects with advanced malignancies and either normal or impaired hepatic function, \nconcentrations of temsirolimus and its metabolite sirolimus were increased in patients with elevated \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) or bilirubin levels. Assessment of AST and bilirubin levels is \nrecommended before initiation of temsirolimus and periodically after. An increased rate of fatal events \nwas observed in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The fatal events included those \ndue to progression of disease; however a causal relationship cannot be excluded. \n \nBased on the Phase 1 study, no dose adjustment of temsirolimus is recommended for RCC patients \nwith baseline platelet counts \uf0b3100 x 109/l and mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin up \nto 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN] with any abnormality of AST, or as defined by Child-Pugh \nClass A or B). For patients with RCC and severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN \nwith any abnormality of AST, or as defined by Child-Pugh Class C), the recommended dose for \npatients who have baseline platelets \uf0b3100 x 109/l is 10 mg intravenous once a week infused over a \n30-60 minute period (see section 4.2). \n \nIntracerebral bleeding \n \nPatients with central nervous system (CNS) tumours (primary CNS tumours or metastases) and/or \nreceiving anticoagulation therapy may be at an increased risk of developing intracerebral bleeding \n(including fatal outcomes) while receiving therapy with temsirolimus. \n \nThrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia \n \nGrades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia have been observed in the MCL clinical trial (see \nsection 4.8). Patients on temsirolimus who develop thrombocytopenia may be at increased risk of \nbleeding events, including epistaxis (see section 4.8). Patients on temsirolimus with baseline \nneutropenia may be at risk of developing febrile neutropenia. Cases of anaemia have been reported in \nRCC and MCL (see section 4.8). Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to \ninitiating temsirolimus therapy and peridically thereafter. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients may be immunosuppressed and should be carefully observed for the occurrence of infections, \nincluding opportunistic infections. Among patients receiving 175 mg/week for the treatment of MCL, \ninfections (including Grade 3 and 4 infections) were substantially increased compared to lower doses \nand compared to conventional chemotherapy. Cases of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) some \nwith fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received temsirolimus, many of whom also \nreceived corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis of PCP should be considered \nfor patients who require concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents based \nupon current standard of care. \n\n\n\n 6\n\n \nCataracts \n \nCataracts have been observed in some patients who received the combination of temsirolimus and \ninterferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1). \n \nHypersensitivity/infusion reactions \n \nHypersensitivity/infusion reactions (including some life-threatening and rare fatal reactions), including \nand not limited to flushing, chest pain, dyspnoea, hypotension, apnoea, loss of consciousness, \nhypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been associated with the administration of temsirolimus (see \nsection 4.8). These reactions can occur very early in the first infusion, but may also occur with \nsubsequent infusions. Patients should be monitored early during the infusion and appropriate \nsupportive care should be available. The temsirolimus infusion should be interrupted in all patients \nwith severe infusion reactions and appropriate medical therapy administered. A benefit-risk \nassessment should be done prior to the continuation of temsirolimus therapy in patients with severe or \nlife-threatening reactions. \n \nIf a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the temsirolimus infusion despite the \npremedication, the infusion must be stopped and the patient observed for at least 30 to 60 minutes \n(depending on the severity of the reaction). At the discretion of the physician, treatment may be \nresumed after the administration of an H1-receptor antagonist (diphenhydramine or similar \nantihistamine) and a H2-receptor antagonist (intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine \n50 mg) approximately 30 minutes before restarting the temsirolimus infusion. Administration of \ncorticosteroids may be considered; however, the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment in this setting has \nnot been established. The infusion may then be resumed at a slower rate (up to 60 minutes) and should \nbe completed within six hours from the time that temsirolimus is first added to sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nBecause it is recommended that an H1 antihistamine be administered to patients before the start of the \nintravenous temsirolimus infusion, temsirolimus should be used with caution in patients with known \nhypersensitivity to the antihistamine or in patients who cannot receive the antihistamine for other \nmedical reasons. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative \ndermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the oral administration of \nsirolimus. \n \nHyperglycaemia/glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus \n \nPatients should be advised that treatment with temsirolimus may be associated with an increase in \nblood glucose levels in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. In the RCC clinical trial, a Phase 3 clinical \ntrial for RCC, 26% of patients reported hyperglycaemia as an adverse event. In the MCL clinical trial, \na Phase 3 clinical trial for MCL, 11% of patients reported hyperglycaemia as an adverse event. This \nmay result in the need for an increase in the dose of, or initiation of, insulin and/or hypoglycaemic \nagent therapy. Patients should be advised to report excessive thirst or any increase in the volume or \nfrequency of urination. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \n \nThere have been cases of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal reports, occurring in \npatients who received weekly intravenous temsirolimus. Some patients were asymptomatic or had \nminimal symptoms with pneumonitis detected on computed tomography scan or chest radiograph. \nOthers presented with symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough, and fever. Some patients required \ndiscontinuation of temsirolimus or treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, while some \npatients continued treatment without additional intervention. It is recommended that patients undergo \nbaseline radiographic assessment by lung computed tomography scan or chest radiograph prior to the \n\n\n\n 7\n\ninitiation of temsirolimus therapy. Periodical follow-up assessments may be considered. It is \nrecommended that patients be followed closely for occurrence of clinical respiratory symptoms and \npatients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. If clinically \nsignificant respiratory symptoms develop, temsirolimus administration may be withheld until after \nrecovery of symptoms and improvement of radiographic findings related to pneumonitis. \nOpportunistic infections such as PCP should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Empiric \ntreatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics may be considered. For patients who require use of \ncorticosteroids, prophylaxis of PCP should be considered based upon current standard of care. \n \nHyperlipaemia \n \nThe use of temsirolimus was associated with increases in serum triglycerides and cholesterol. In the \nRCC clinical trial 1, hyperlipaemia was reported as an adverse event in 27% of patients. In the MCL \nclinical trial, hyperlipaemia was reported as an adverse event in 9.3% of patients. This may require \ninitiation, or increase, in the dose of lipid-lowering agents. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides should \nbe tested before and during treatment with temsirolimus. The known association of temsirolimus with \nhyperlipaemia may predispose to myocardial infarction. \n \nWound healing complications \n \nThe use of temsirolimus has been associated with abnormal wound healing; therefore, caution should \nbe exercised with the use of temsirolimus in the peri-surgical period. \n \nMalignancies \n \nThe possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result \nfrom immunosuppression. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to \nsunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a \nsunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nConcomitant use of temsirolimus with sunitinib \n \nThe combination of temsirolimus and sunitinib resulted in dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-limiting \ntoxicities (Grade 3/4 erythematous maculopapular rash, gout/cellulitis requiring hospitalisation) were \nobserved in 2 out of 3 patients treated in the first cohort of a Phase 1 study at doses of temsirolimus \n15 mg intravenous per week and sunitinib 25 mg oral per day (Days 1-28 followed by a 2-week rest) \n(see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or calcium channel blockers \n \nCaution should be exercised when temsirolimus is given concomitantly with ACE inhibitors (e.g. \nramipril) and/or calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine). An increased risk of angioneurotic \noedema (including delayed reactions occurring two months following initiation of therapy) is possible \nin patients who receive temsirolimus concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor and/or a calcium channel \nblocker (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nAgents inducing CYP3A metabolism \n \nAgents such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John\u2019s wort are strong \ninducers of CYP3A4/5 and may decrease composite exposure of the active drug substances, \ntemsirolimus and its metabolite, sirolimus. Therefore, for patients with RCC, continuous \nadministration beyond 5-7 days with agents that have CYP3A4/5 induction potential should be \navoided. For patients with MCL, it is recommended that coadministration of CYP3A4/5 inducers \nshould be avoided due to the higher dose of temsirolimus (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n 8\n\nAgents inhibiting CYP3A metabolism \n \nAgents such as protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir), antifungals (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, \nvoriconazole), and nefazodone are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and may increase blood concentrations \nof the active drug substances, temsirolimus and its metabolite, sirolimus. Therefore, concomitant \ntreatment with agents that have strong CYP3A4 inhibition potential should be avoided. Concomitant \ntreatment with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. aprepitant, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil, \ngrapefruit juice) should only be administered with caution in patients receiving 25 mg and should be \navoided in patients receiving temsirolimus doses higher than 25 mg (see section 4.5). Alternative \ntreatments with agents that do not have CYP3A4 inhibition potential should be considered (see section \n4.5). \n \nVaccinations \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect responses to vaccination. During treatment with temsirolimus, \nvaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with \ntemsirolimus. Examples of live vaccines are: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, Bacillus Calmette-\nGu\u00e9rin (BCG), yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. \n \nExcipients \n \nAfter first dilution of the concentrate with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent, the concentrate-solvent \nmixture contains 35% volume ethanol (alcohol), i.e., up to 0.693 g per 25 mg dose of temsirolimus, \nequivalent to 17.6 ml beer or 7.3 ml wine per dose. Patients administered the higher dose of 175 mg of \ntemsirolimus for the initial treatment of MCL may receive up to 4.85 g of ethanol (equivalent to \n123 ml beer or 51 ml wine per dose). \n \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism. \n \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups, such as \npatients with liver disease or epilepsy. The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the \neffects of other medicines. The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may impair the ability to \ndrive or use machines (see section 4.7). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nConcomitant use of temsirolimus with sunitinib \n \nThe combination of temsirolimus and sunitinib resulted in dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-limiting \ntoxicities (Grade 3/4 erythematous maculopapular rash, gout/cellulitis requiring hospitalisation) were \nobserved in 2 out of 3 patients treated in the first cohort of a Phase 1 study at doses of temsirolimus \n15 mg intravenous per week and sunitinib 25 mg oral per day (Days 1-28 followed by a 2-week rest) \n(see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or calcium channel blockers \n \nAn increased incidence of angioneurotic oedema (including delayed reactions occurring two months \nfollowing initiation of therapy) has been observed in patients who received temsirolimus or other \nmTOR inhibitors in combination with an ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) and/or a calcium channel \nblocker (e.g. amlodipine) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nAgents inducing CYP3A metabolism \n \nCo-administration of temsirolimus with rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4/5 inducer, had no significant \neffect on temsirolimus maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration vs. time curve \n\n\n\n 9\n\n(AUC) after intravenous administration, but decreased sirolimus Cmax by 65% and AUC by 56%, \ncompared to temsirolimus treatment alone. Therefore, concomitant treatment with agents that have \nCYP3A4/5 induction potential should be avoided (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \nrifampicin, and St. John\u2019s wort) (see section 4.4). \n \nAgents inhibiting CYP3A metabolism \n \nCo-administration of temsirolimus 5 mg with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, had no \nsignificant effect on temsirolimus Cmax or AUC; however, sirolimus AUC increased 3.1-fold, and \nAUCsum (temsirolimus + sirolimus) increased 2.3-fold compared to temsirolimus alone. The effect on \nthe unbound concentrations of sirolimus has not been determined, but is expected to be larger than the \neffect on whole-blood concentrations due to the saturable binding to red blood cells. The effect may \nalso be more pronounced at a 25 mg dose. Therefore, substances that are potent inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 activity (e.g. nelfinavir, ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, nefazodone) \nincrease sirolimus blood concentrations. Concomitant treatment of temsirolimus with these agents \nshould be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, clarithromycin, \nerythromycin, aprepitant, amiodarone) should only be administered with caution in patients receiving \n25 mg and should be avoided in patients receiving temsirolimus doses higher than 25 mg. \n \nInteraction with medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/5 \n \nIn 23 healthy subjects the concentration of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, was unaffected when \n25 mg of temsirolimus was co-administered. In 36 patients with MCL, including 4 poor metabolisers, \nthe effect of CYP2D6 inhibition after administration of single doses of 175 mg and 75 mg \ntemsirolimus was investigated. Population PK analysis based on sparse sampling indicated no \nclinically significant interaction effect on AUC and Cmax of the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine. No \nclinically significant effect is anticipated when temsirolimus is co-administered with agents that are \nmetabolised by CYP2D6. \n \nThe effect of a 175 or 75 mg temsirolimus dose on CYP3A4/5 substrates has not been studied. \nHowever, in vitro studies in human liver microsomes followed by physiologically-based \npharmacokinetic modelling indicate that the blood concentrations achieved after a 175 mg dose of \ntemsirolimus most likely leads to relevant inhibition of CYP3A4/5 (see section 5.2). Therefore, \ncaution is advised during concomitant administration of temsirolimus at a dose of 175 mg with \nmedicinal products that are metabolised predominantly via CYP3A4/5 and that have a narrow \ntherapeutic index. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products that are P-glycoprotein substrates \n \nIn an in vitro study, temsirolimus inhibited the transport of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates with an \nIC50 value of 2 \u00b5M. In vivo, the effect of P-gp inhibition has not been investigated in a clinical drug-\ndrug interaction study, however, recent preliminary data from a Phase 1 study of combined \nlenalidomide (dose of 25 mg) and temsirolimus (dose of 20 mg) seem to support the in vitro findings \nand suggest an increased risk of adverse events. Therefore, when temsirolimus is co-administered with \nmedicinal products which are P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, vincristine, colchicine, dabigatran, \nlenalidomide, and paclitaxel) close monitoring for adverse events related to the co-administered \nmedicinal products should be observed. \n \n\n\n\n 10\n\nAmphiphilic agents \n \nTemsirolimus has been associated with phospholipidosis in rats. Phospholipidosis has not been \nobserved in mice or monkeys treated with temsirolimus, nor has it been documented in patients treated \nwith temsirolimus. Although phospholipidosis has not been shown to be a risk for patients \nadministered temsirolimus, it is possible that combined administration of temsirolimus with other \namphiphilic agents such as amiodarone or statins could result in an increased risk of amphiphilic \npulmonary toxicity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nDue to the unknown risk related to potential exposure during early pregnancy, women of childbearing \npotential must be advised not to become pregnant while using Torisel.  \n \nMen with partners of childbearing potential should use medically acceptable contraception while \nreceiving Torisel (see section 5.3). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of temsirolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity. In reproduction studies in animals, temsirolimus caused \nembryo/foetotoxicity that was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weights (with associated \ndelays in skeletal ossification) in rats and rabbits. Teratogenic effects (omphalocele) were seen in \nrabbits (see section 5.3). \n \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. Torisel must not be used during pregnancy, unless the risk \nfor the embryo is justified by the expected benefit for the mother. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether temsirolimus is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of temsirolimus \nin milk has not been studied in animals. However, sirolimus, the main metabolite of temsirolimus, is \nexcreted in milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants \nfrom temsirolimus, breast-feeding should be discontinued during therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nIn male rats, decreased fertility and partly reversible reductions in sperm counts were reported (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTemsirolimus has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on the \nevidence available. \n \nFor patients receiving the higher dose of 175 mg intravenous of temsirolimus for the treatment of \nMCL, the amount of ethanol in this medicinal product may impair the ability to drive or use machines \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most serious reactions observed with temsirolimus in clinical trials are hypersensitivity/infusion \nreactions (including some life-threatening and rare fatal reactions), hyperglycaemia/glucose \n\n\n\n 11\n\nintolerance, infections, interstitial lung disease (pneumonitis), hyperlipaemia, intracranial \nhaemorrhage, renal failure, intestinal perforation, wound healing complication, thrombocytopenia, \nneutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), pulmonary embolism. \n \nThe adverse reactions (all grades) experienced by at least 20% of the patients in RCC and MCL \nregistration studies include anaemia, nausea, rash (including rash, pruritic rash, maculopapular rash, \npustular rash), decreased appetite, oedema asthenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, pyrexia, \nepistaxis, mucosal inflammation, stomatitis, vomiting, hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolemia, \ndysgeusia, pruritus, cough, infection, pneumonia, dyspnoea. \n \nCataracts have been observed in some patients who received the combination of temsirolimus and \nIFN-\u03b1. \n \nBased on the results of the phase 3 studies, elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain \nadverse reactions, including face oedema, pneumonia, pleural effusion, anxiety, depression, insomnia, \ndyspnoea, leukopenia, lymphopenia, myalgia, arthralgia, ageusia, dizziness, upper respiratory \ninfection, mucositis, and rhinitis. \n \nSerious adverse reactions observed in clinical trials of temsirolimus for advanced RCC, but not in \nclinical trials of temsirolimus for MCL include: anaphylaxis, impaired wound healing, renal failure \nwith fatal outcomes, and pulmonary embolism. \n \nSerious adverse reactions observed in clinical trials of temsirolimus for MCL, but not in clinical trials \nof temsirolimus for advanced RCC include: thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (including febrile \nneutropenia). \n \nSee section 4.4 for additional information concerning serious adverse reactions, including appropriate \nactions to be taken if specific reactions occur. \n \nThe occurrence of undesirable effects following the dose of 175 mg temsirolimus/week for MCL, \ne.g. Grade 3 or 4 infections or thrombocytopenia, is associated with a higher incidence than that \nobserved with either 75 mg temsirolimus/week or conventional chemotherapy. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions that were reported in RCC and MCL patients in the phase 3 studies are listed below \n(Table 1), by system organ class, frequency and grade of severity (NCI-CTCAE). Frequencies are \ndefined as follows: very common (\uf0b31/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n 12\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions

reactions \n \nPost-marketing experience \nAngioneurotic oedema-type reactions have been reported in some patients who received temsirolimus \nand ACE-inhibitors concomitantly. \n \nCases of PCP, some with fatal outcomes, have been reported (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population \n \nIn a Phase 1/2 study, 71 patients (59 patients, aged from 1 to 17 years old, and 12 patients, aged 18 to \n21 years) were administered temsirolimus at doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 to 150 mg/m2 (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nThe adverse reactions reported by the highest percentage of patients were haematologic (anaemia, \nleukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), metabolic (hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipaemia, \nhyperglycaemia, increase of serum aspartate amino transferase (AST) and serum alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) plasma levels), and digestive (mucositis, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific treatment for temsirolimus overdose. While temsirolimus has been safely \nadministered to patients with renal cancer with repeated intravenous doses as high as 220 mg/m2, in \nMCL, two administrations of 330 mg temsirolimus/week in one patient resulted in Grade 3 rectal \nbleeding and Grade 2 diarrhoea. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01X E09 \n \n\n\n\n 16\n\nMechanism of action \n \nTemsirolimus is a selective inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus binds \nto an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), and the protein/temsirolimus complex binds and inhibits the \nactivity of mTOR that controls cell division. In vitro, at high concentrations (10-20 \uf06dM), temsirolimus \ncan bind and inhibit mTOR in the absence of FKBP-12. Biphasic dose response of cell growth \ninhibition was observed. High concentrations resulted in complete cell growth inhibition in vitro, \nwhereas inhibition mediated by FKBP-12/temsirolimus complex alone resulted in approximately 50% \ndecrease in cell proliferation. Inhibition of mTOR activity results in a G1 growth delay at nanomolar \nconcentrations and growth arrest at micromolar concentrations in treated tumour cells resulting from \nselective disruption of translation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as D-type cyclins, c-myc, and \nornithine decarboxylase. When mTOR activity is inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate, and thereby \ncontrol the activity of protein translation factors (4E-BP1 and S6K, both downstream of mTOR in the \nP13 kinase/AKT pathway) that control cell division, is blocked. \n \nIn addition to regulating cell cycle proteins, mTOR can regulate translation of the hypoxia-inducible \nfactors, HIF-1 and HIF-2 alpha. These transcription factors regulate the ability of tumours to adapt to \nhypoxic microenvironments and to produce the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor \n(VEGF). The anti-tumour effect of temsirolimus, therefore, may also in part stem from its ability to \ndepress levels of HIF and VEGF in the tumour or tumour microenvironment, thereby impairing vessel \ndevelopment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRenal cell carcinoma \n \nThe safety and efficacy of temsirolimus in the treatment of advanced RCC were studied in the \nfollowing two randomised clinical trials: \n \nRCC clinical trial 1 \nRCC clinical trial 1 was a Phase 3, multi-centre, 3-arm, randomised, open-label study in previously \nuntreated patients with advanced RCC and with 3 or more of 6 pre-selected prognostic risk factors \n(less than 1 year from time of initial RCC diagnosis to randomisation, Karnofsky performance status \nof 60 or 70, haemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium of greater than \n10 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase\uf03e1.5 times the upper limit of normal, more than 1 metastatic organ \nsite). The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included \nprogression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate, time to treatment \nfailure (TTF), and quality adjusted survival measurement. Patients were stratified for prior \nnephrectomy status within 3 geographic regions and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive IFN-\u03b1 \nalone (n = 207), temsirolimus alone (25 mg weekly; n = 209), or the combination of IFN-\u03b1 and \ntemsirolimus (n = 210). \n \nIn RCC clinical trial 1, temsirolimus 25 mg was associated with a statistically significant advantage \nover IFN-\u03b1 in the primary endpoint of OS at the 2nd pre-specified interim analysis (n = 446 events, \np = 0.0078). The temsirolimus arm showed a 49% increase in median OS compared with the IFN-\u03b1 \narm. Temsirolimus also was associated with statistically significant advantages over IFN-\u03b1 in the \nsecondary endpoints of PFS, TTF, and clinical benefit rate. \n \nThe combination of temsirolimus 15 mg and IFN-\u03b1 did not result in a significant increase in overall \nsurvival when compared to IFN-\u03b1 alone at either the interim analysis (median 8.4 vs. 7.3 months, \nhazard ratio = 0.96, p = 0.6965) or final analysis (median 8.4 vs. 7.3 months, hazard ratio = 0.93, \np = 0.4902). Treatment with the combination of temsirolimus and IFN-\u03b1 resulted in a statistically \nsignificant increase in the incidence of certain Grade 3-4 adverse events (weight loss, anaemia, \nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia and mucosal inflammation) when compared to the adverse events \nobserved in the IFN-\u03b1 or temsirolimus-alone arms. \n\n\n\n 17\n\n \nSummary of efficacy results in temsirolimus RCC clinical trial 1  \n\nParameter  temsirolimus \nn = 209  \n\nIFN-\u03b1  \nn = 207  \n\nP-value\na\n Hazard ratio \n\n(95% CI)\nb\n\nPre-specified interim analysis  \nMedian overall survival, \nMonths (95% CI)  10.9 (8.6, 12.7)  \n\n7.3 (6.1, \n8.8) 0.0078  0.73 (0.58, 0.92) \n\nFinal analysis  \nMedian overall survival, \nMonths (95% CI)  10.9 (8.6, 12.7)  \n\n7.3 (6.1, \n8.8)  0.0252  0.78 (0.63, 0.97) \n\nMedian progression-free \nsurvival by independent \nassessment  \nMonths (95% CI)  \n\n5.6 (3.9, 7.2)  3.2 (2.2, 4.0)  0.0042  0.74 (0.60, 0.91) \n\nMedian progression-free \nsurvival by investigator \nassessment  \nMonths (95% CI)  \n\n3.8 (3.6, 5.2)  1.9 (1.9, 2.2)  0.0028  0.74 (0.60, 0.90) \n\nOverall response rate by \nindependent assessment  \n% (95% CI)  \n\n9.1 (5.2, 13.0)  5.3 (2.3, 8.4)  0.1361\nc\n NA  \n\nCI = confidence interval; NA = not applicable. \na Based on log-rank test stratified by prior nephrectomy and region. \nb Based on Cox proportional hazard model stratified by prior nephrectomy and region (95% CI are \ndescriptive only). \nc Based on Cochran-Mantel-Hansel test stratified by prior nephrectomy and region. \n \nIn RCC clinical trial 1, 31% of patients treated with temsirolimus were 65 or older. In patients younger \nthan 65, median overall survival was 12 months (95% CI 9.9, 14.2) with a hazard ratio of \n0.67 (95% CI 0.52, 0.87) compared with those treated with IFN-\u03b1. In patients 65 or older, median \noverall survival was 8.6 months (95% CI 6.4, 11.5) with a hazard ratio of 1.15 (95% CI 0.78, 1.68) \ncompared with those treated with IFN-\u03b1. \n \nRCC clinical trial 2 \nRCC clinical trial 2 was a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, outpatient trial to evaluate the \nefficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of three dose levels of temsirolimus when administered to \npreviously treated patients with advanced RCC. The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, and OS was \nalso evaluated. One hundred eleven (111) patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive \n25 mg, 75 mg, or 250 mg intravenous temsirolimus weekly. In the 25 mg arm (n = 36), all patients had \nmetastatic disease; 4 (11%) had no prior chemo- or immunotherapy; 17 (47%) had one prior treatment, \nand 15 (42%) had 2 or more prior treatments for RCC. Twenty-seven (27, 75%) had undergone a \nnephrectomy. Twenty-four (24, 67%) were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) \nperformance status (PS) = 1, and 12 (33%) were ECOG PS = 0. \n \nFor patients treated weekly with 25 mg temsirolimus OS was 13.8 months (95% CI: 9.0, 18.7 months); \nORR was 5.6% (95% CI: 0.7, 18.7%). \n \nMantle cell lymphoma \n \nThe safety and efficacy of intravenous temsirolimus for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory \nMCL were studied in the following Phase 3 clinical study. \n \n\n\n\n 18\n\nMCL clinical trial \nMCL clinical trial is a controlled, randomised, open-label, multicentre, outpatient study comparing \n2 different dosing regimens of temsirolimus with an investigator's choice of therapy in patients with \nrelapsed and/or refractory MCL. Subjects with MCL (that was confirmed by histology, \nimmunophenotype, and cyclin D1 analysis) who had received 2 to 7 prior therapies that included \nanthracyclines and alkylating agents, and rituximab (and could include haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant) and whose disease was relapsed and/or refractory were eligible for the study. Subjects were \nrandomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous temsirolimus 175 mg (3 successive weekly \ndoses) followed by 75 mg weekly (n = 54), intravenous temsirolimus 175 mg (3 successive weekly \ndoses) followed by 25 mg weekly (n = 54), or the investigator\u2019s choice of single-agent treatment (as \nspecified in the protocol; n = 54). Investigator's choice therapies included: gemcitabine (intravenous: \n22 [41.5%]), fludarabine (intravenous: 12 [22.6%] or oral: 2 [3.8%]), chlorambucil (oral: 3 [5.7%]), \ncladribine (intravenous: 3 [5.7%]), etoposide (intravenous: 3 [5.7%]), cyclophosphamide (oral: 2 \n[3.8%]), thalidomide (oral: 2 [3.8%]), vinblastine (intravenous: 2 [3.8%]), alemtuzumab (intravenous: \n1 [1.9%]), and lenalidomide (oral: 1 [1.9%]). The primary endpoint of the study was PFS, as assessed \nby an independent radiologist and oncology review. Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS and \nORR. \n \nThe results for the MCL clinical trial are summarised in the following table. Temsirolimus \n175/75 (temsirolimus 175 mg weekly for 3 weeks followed by 75 mg weekly) led to an improvement \nin PFS compared with investigator's choice in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MCL that was \nstatistically significant (hazard ratio = 0.44; p-value = 0.0009). Median PFS of the temsirolimus \n175/75 mg group (4.8 months) was prolonged by 2.9 months compared to the investigator's choice \ngroup (1.9 months). OS was similar. \n \nTemsirolimus also was associated with statistically significant advantages over investigator\u2019s choice in \nthe secondary endpoint of ORR. The evaluations of PFS and ORR were based on blinded independent \nradiologic assessment of tumour response using the International Workshop Criteria. \n\nSummary of efficacy results in temsirolimus MCL clinical trial \n\nParameter \n \n \n\ntemsirolimus \n175/75 mg \n\nn = 54 \n\nInvestigator\u2019s \nchoice \n\n(inv choice) \nn = 54 \n\nP-value Hazard ratio (97.5% CI)a \n\nMedian \nprogression-free \nsurvivalb \nMonths (97.5% CI) \n\n \n4.8 (3.1, 8.1) \n\n \n1.9 (1.6, 2.5) \n\n \n0.0009c \n\n \n0.44 (0.25, 0.78) \n\nObjective \nresponse rateb \n% (95% CI) \n\n22.2 (11.1, 33.3) 1.9 (0.0, 5.4) 0.0019d NA \n\nOverall survival \nMonths (95% CI) \n\n \n12.8 (8.6, 22.3) \n\n \n\n \n10.3 (5.8, 15.8) \n\n \n\n \n0.2970c \n\n \n\n \n0.78 (0.49, 1.24) \n\n \nOne-year survival \nrate \n% (97.5% CI) \n\n0.47 (0.31, 0.61) 0.46 (0.30, 0.60) \n  \n\na Compared with inv choice based on Cox proportional hazard model.  \nb Disease assessment is based on radiographic review by independent radiologists and review of \nclinical data by independent oncologists. \nc Compared with inv choice based on log-rank test. \nd Compared with inv choice alone based on Fisher's exact test. \nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; NA = not applicable. \n \n\n\n\n 19\n\nThe temsirolimus 175 mg (3 successive weekly doses) followed by 25 mg weekly treatment arm did \nnot result in a significant increase in PFS when compared with investigator\u2019s choice (median \n3.4 vs. 1.9 months, hazard ratio = 0.65, CI = 0.39, 1.10, p = 0.0618). \n \nIn the MCL clinical trial, there was no difference in efficacy in patients with respect to age, sex, race, \ngeographic region, or baseline disease characteristics. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn a Phase 1/2 safety and exploratory efficacy study, 71 patients (59 patients, aged from 1 to 17 years, \nand 12 patients, aged from 18 to 21 years) received temsirolimus as a 60-minute intravenous infusion \nonce weekly in three-week cycles. In Part 1, 14 patients aged from 1 to 17 years with advanced \nrecurrent/refractory solid tumours received temsirolimus at doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 to \n150 mg/m2. In Part 2, 45 patients aged from 1 to 17 years with recurrent/relapsed rhabdomyosarcoma, \nneuroblastoma, or high grade glioma were administered temsirolimus at a weekly dose of 75 mg/m2. \nAdverse events were generally similar to those observed in adults (see section 4.8). \n \nTemsirolimus was found to be ineffective in paediatric patients with neuroblastoma, \nrhabdomyosarcoma, and high-grade glioma (n = 52). For subjects with neuroblastoma, the objective \nresponse rate was 5.3% (95% CI: 0.1%, 26.0%). After 12 weeks of treatment, no response was \nobserved in subjects with rhabdomyosarcoma or high-grade glioma. None of the 3 cohorts met the \ncriterion for advancing to the second stage of the Simon 2-stage design. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTorisel in all subsets of the paediatric population in MCL (see section 4.2 on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing administration of a single 25 mg intravenous dose of temsirolimus in patients with cancer, \nmean Cmax in whole blood was 585 ng/ml (coefficient of variation [CV] = 14%), and mean AUC in \nblood was 1627 ng\u2022h/ml (CV = 26%). For patients receiving 175 mg weekly for 3 weeks followed by \n75 mg weekly, estimated Cmax in whole blood at end of infusion was 2457 ng/ml during Week 1, and \n2574 ng/ml during Week 3. \n \nDistribution \n \nTemsirolimus exhibits a polyexponential decline in whole blood concentrations, and distribution is \nattributable to preferential binding to FKBP-12 in blood cells. The mean \u00b1standard deviation (SD) \ndissociation constant (Kd) of binding was 5.1 \u00b1 3.0 ng/ml, denoting the concentration at which 50% of \nbinding sites in blood cells were occupied. Temsirolimus distribution is dose-dependent with mean \n(10th, 90th percentiles) maximal specific binding in blood cells of 1.4 mg (0.47 to 2.5 mg). Following \na single 25 mg temsirolimus intravenous dose, mean steady-state volume of distribution in whole \nblood of patients with cancer was 172 liters. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSirolimus, an equally potent metabolite to temsirolimus, was observed as the principal metabolite in \nhumans following intravenous treatment. During in vitro temsirolimus metabolism studies, sirolimus, \nseco-temsirolimus and seco-sirolimus were observed; additional metabolic pathways were \nhydroxylation, reduction and demethylation. Following a single 25 mg intravenous dose in patients \nwith cancer, sirolimus AUC was 2.7-fold that of temsirolimus AUC, due principally to the longer \nhalf-life of sirolimus. \n \n\n\n\n 20\n\nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 25 mg intravenous dose of temsirolimus, temsirolimus mean \u00b1 SD systemic \nclearance from whole blood was 11.4 \u00b1 2.4 l/h. Mean half-lives of temsirolimus and sirolimus were \n17.7 hours and 73.3 hours, respectively. Following administration of [14C] temsirolimus, excretion was \npredominantly via the faeces (78%), with renal elimination of active substance and metabolites \naccounting for 4.6% of the administered dose. Sulfate or glucuronide conjugates were not detected in \nthe human faecal samples, suggesting that sulfation and glucuronidation do not appear to be major \npathways involved in the excretion of temsirolimus. Therefore, inhibitors of these metabolic pathways \nare not expected to affect the elimination of temsirolimus. \n \nModel-predicted values for clearance from plasma, after applying a 175 mg dose for 3 weeks, and \nsubsequently 75 mg for 3 weeks, indicate temsirolimus and sirolimus metabolite trough concentrations \nof approximately 1.2 ng/ml and 10.7 ng/ml, respectively. \n \nTemsirolimus and sirolimus were demonstrated to be substrates for P-gp in vitro. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nInhibition of CYP isoforms \nIn in vitro studies in human liver microsomes, temsirolimus inhibited CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 \nand CYP2C8 catalytic activity with Ki values of 3.1, 1.5, 14 and 27 \u03bcM, respectively. \n \nIC50 values for inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 by temsirolimus were 48 and 100 \u03bcM, \nrespectively. Based on a whole blood mean Cmax concentration of 2.6 \u03bcM for temsirolimus in MCL \npatients receiving the 175 mg dose there is a potential for interactions with concomitantly administered \nmedicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4/5 in patients treated with the 175 mg dose of \ntemsirolimus (see section 4.5). Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling has shown that after \nfour weeks treatment with temsirolimus, the AUC of midazolam can be increased 3-to-4 fold and Cmax \naround 1.5-fold when midazolam is taken within a few hours after the start of the temsirolimus \ninfusion. However, it is unlikely that whole blood concentrations of temsirolimus after intravenous \nadministration of temsirolimus will inhibit the metabolic clearance of concomitant medicinal products \nthat are substrates of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2B6 or CYP2E1. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nTemsirolimus should be used with caution when treating patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nTemsirolimus is cleared predominantly by the liver. \n \nTemsirolimus and sirolimus pharmacokinetics have been investigated in an open-label, dose-escalation \nstudy in 110 patients with advanced malignancies and either normal or impaired hepatic function. For \n7 patients with severe hepatic impairment (ODWG, group D) receiving the 10 mg dose of \ntemsirolimus, the mean AUC of temsirolimus was ~1.7-fold higher compared to 7 patients with mild \nhepatic impairment (ODWG, group B). For patients with severe hepatic impairment, a reduction of the \ntemsirolimus dose to 10 mg is recommended to provide temsirolimus plus sirolimus exposures in \nblood (mean AUCsum approximately 6510 ng\u00b7h/ml; n=7), which approximate to those following the \n25 mg dose (mean AUCsum approximately 6580 ng\u00b7h/ml; n=6) in patients with normal liver function \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nThe AUCsum of temsirolimus and sirolimus on day 8 in patients with mild and moderate hepatic \nimpairment receiving 25 mg temsirolimus was similar to that observed in patients without hepatic \nimpairment receiving 75 mg (mean AUCsum mild: approximately 9770 ng*h/ml, n=13; moderate: \napproximately 12380 ng*h/ml, n=6; normal approximately 10580 ng*h/ml, n=4). \n \n\n\n\n 21\n\nGender, weight, race, age \nTemsirolimus and sirolimus pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by gender. No relevant \ndifferences in exposure were apparent when data from the Caucasian population was compared with \neither the Japanese or Black population. \n \nIn population pharmacokinetic-based data analysis, increased body weight (between 38.6 and \n158.9 kg) was associated with a two-fold range of trough concentration of sirolimus in whole blood. \n \nPharmacokinetic data on temsirolimus and sirolimus are available in patients up to age 79 years. Age \ndoes not appear to affect temsirolimus and sirolimus pharmacokinetics significantly. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn the paediatric population, clearance of temsirolimus was lower and exposure (AUC) was higher \nthan in adults. In contrast, exposure to sirolimus was commensurately reduced in paediatric patients, \nsuch that the net exposure as measured by the sum of temsirolimus and sirolimus AUCs (AUCsum) was \ncomparable to that for adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to or \neven lower than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use, were as follows: \npancreatic islet cell vacuolation (rat), testicular tubular degeneration (mouse, rat and monkey), \nlymphoid atrophy (mouse, rat and monkey), mixed cell inflammation of the colon/caecum (monkey), \nand pulmonary phospholipidosis (rat). \n \nDiarrhoea with mixed cell inflammation of the caecum or colon was observed in monkeys and was \nassociated with an inflammatory response, and may have been due to a disruption of the normal \nintestinal flora. \n \nGeneral inflammatory responses, as indicated by increased fibrinogen and neutrophils, and/or changes \nin serum protein, were observed in mice, rats, and monkeys, although in some cases these clinical \npathology changes were attributed to skin or intestinal inflammation as noted above. For some \nanimals, there were no specific clinical observations or histological changes that suggested \ninflammation. \n \nTemsirolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation in Salmonella \ntyphimurium and Escherichia coli, forward mutation in mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome \naberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with temsirolimus; however, sirolimus, the major \nmetabolite of temsirolimus in humans, was carcinogenic in mice and rats. The following effects were \nreported in mice and/or rats in the carcinogenicity studies conducted: granulocytic leukaemia, \nlymphoma, hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma, and testicular adenoma. \n \nReductions in testicular weights and/or histological lesions (e.g., tubular atrophy and tubular giant \ncells) were observed in mice, rats, and monkeys. In rats, these changes were accompanied by a \ndecreased weight of accessory sex organs (epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicles). In reproduction \ntoxicity studies in animals, decreased fertility and partly reversible reductions in sperm counts were \nreported in male rats. Exposures in animals were lower than those seen in humans receiving clinically \nrelevant doses of temsirolimus. \n \n \n\n\n\n 22\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nConcentrate \nAnhydrous ethanol \nall-rac-\u03b1-Tocopherol (E 307) \nPropylene glycol \nCitric acid (E 330) \n \nSolvent \nPolysorbate 80 (E 433) \nMacrogol 400 \nAnhydrous ethanol \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products, except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \nTorisel 30 mg concentrate must not be added directly to aqueous infusion solutions. Direct addition of \nTorisel 30 mg concentrate to aqueous solutions will result in precipitation of medicinal product. \n \nAlways dilute Torisel 30 mg concentrate with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent before adding to the \ninfusion solution. The concentrate-solvent mixture may only be administered in sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nTorisel, when diluted, contains polysorbate 80, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl) \nphthalate extraction (DEHP) from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This incompatibility has to be considered \nduring the preparation and administration of Torisel. It is important that the recommendations in \nsections 4.2 and 6.6 be followed closely. \n \nPVC bags and medical devices must not be used for the administration of preparations containing \npolysorbate 80, because polysorbate 80 leaches DEHP from PVC. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years. \n \nAfter first dilution of Torisel 30 mg concentrate with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent \n24 hours when stored below 25\u00b0C and protected from light. \n \nAfter further dilution of the concentrate-solvent mixture with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \nfor injection \n6 hours when stored below 25\u00b0C and protected from light. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C)  \n \nDo not freeze. \n \nKeep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n\n\n 23\n\n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nConcentrate \nClear glass vial (type 1), with butyl rubber stopper and a plastic flip-top closure sealed with aluminum \ncontaining 1.2 ml of concentrate \n \nSolvent \nClear glass vial (type 1), with butyl rubber stopper and a plastic flip-top closure sealed with aluminum \ncontaining 2.2 ml of solvent \n \nPack size: 1 vial of concentrate and 1 vial of solvent \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDuring handling and preparation of admixtures, Torisel should be protected from excessive room light \nand sunlight. \n \nTorisel, when diluted, contains polysorbate 80 and therefore appropriate administration materials must \nbe used (see sections 6.1 and 6.2). \n \nBags/containers that come in contact with Torisel must be made of glass, polyolefin, or polyethylene. \n \nTorisel concentrate and solvent should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \nprior to administration. \n \nDo not use if particulates are present, or if discoloured. Use a new vial. \n \nDilution \n \nThe concentrate for solution for infusion must be diluted with the supplied solvent before \nadministration in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nNote: For MCL, multiple vials will be required for each dose over 25 mg. Each vial of Torisel must be \ndiluted according to the instructions below. The required amount of concentrate--solvent mixture from \neach vial must be combined in one syringe for rapid injection into 250 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection (see section 4.2). \n \nThe concentrate-solvent mixture should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration. \n \nDo not use if particulates are present, or if discoloured. \n \nIn preparing the solution, the following two-step process must be carried out in an aseptic manner \naccording to local standards for handling cytotoxic/cytostatic medicinal products: \n \nSTEP 1:  DILUTION OF THE CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION WITH THE \n\nSUPPLIED SOLVENT \n \n\n\uf0b7 Withdraw 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent. \n\uf0b7 Inject the 1.8 ml of solvent into the vial of Torisel 30 mg concentrate. \n\uf0b7 Mix the solvent and the concentrate well by inversion of the vial. Sufficient time should be \n\nallowed for air bubbles to subside. The solution should be a clear to slightly turbid, colourless \nto light-yellow to yellow solution, essentially free from visual particulates. \n\n \nOne vial of Torisel concentrate contains 30 mg of temsirolimus: when the 1.2 ml concentrate is \ncombined with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent, a total volume of 3.0 ml is obtained, and the \n\n\n\n 24\n\nconcentration of temsirolimus will be 10 mg/ml. The concentrate-solvent mixture is stable below 25\u00b0C \nfor up to 24 hours. \n \nSTEP 2:  ADMINISTRATION OF CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR \n\nINFUSION-SOLVENT MIXTURE IN SODIUM CHLORIDE 9MG/ML (0.9%) \nSOLUTION FOR INJECTION  \n\n \n\uf0b7 Withdraw the required amount of concentrate-solvent mixture (containing temsirolimus \n\n10 mg/ml) from the vial; i.e., 2.5 ml for a temsirolimus dose of 25 mg. \n\uf0b7 Inject the withdrawn volume rapidly into 250 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \n\nfor injection to ensure adequate mixing. \n \nThe admixture should be mixed by inversion of the bag or bottle, avoiding excessive shaking, as this \nmay cause foaming. \n \nThe final diluted solution in the bag or bottle should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration prior to administration. The admixture of Torisel in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection should be protected from excessive room light and sunlight. \n \nFor MCL, multiple vials will be required for each dose over 25 mg.  \n \nAdministration \n \n\u2022 Administration of the final diluted solution should be completed within six hours from the time \n\nthat Torisel is first added to sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \n\u2022 Torisel is infused over a 30- to 60-minute period once a week. The use of an infusion pump is the \n\npreferred method of administration to ensure accurate delivery of the medicinal product. \n \n\u2022 Appropriate administration materials must be used to avoid excessive loss of medicinal product \n\nand to decrease the rate of DEHP extraction. The administration materials must consist of non-\nDEHP, non-PVC tubing with appropriate filter. An in-line polyethersulfone filter with a pore size \nof not greater than 5 microns is recommended for administration to avoid the possibility of \nparticles bigger than 5 microns being infused. If the administration set available does not have an \nin-line filter incorporated, a filter should be added at the end of the set (i.e., an end-filter) before \nthe admixture reaches the vein of the patient. Different end-filters can be used ranging in filter \npore size from 0.2 microns up to 5 microns. The use of both an in-line and end-filter is not \nrecommended (see sections 6.1 and 6.2). \n\n \n\u2022 Torisel, when diluted, contains polysorbate 80,and therefore appropriate administration materials \n\nmust be used (see sections 6.1 and 6.2). It is important that the recommendations in section 4.2 be \nfollowed closely. \n\n \nDisposal \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What Torisel is and what it is used for \n \nTorisel contains the active substance temsirolimus. \n \nTemsirolimus is a selective inhibitor of the enzyme mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) that \nblocks tumour cell growth and division. \n \nTorisel is used to treat the following types of cancer in adults: \n \n- Advanced cancer of the kidney (renal cancer). \n- Previously treated mantle cell lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting the lymph nodes. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Torisel \n \nDo not use Torisel: \n \n- if you are allergic to temsirolimus, to polysorbate 80 or to any of the other ingredients listed in \n\nsection 6. \n- if you are allergic to sirolimus (used to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted kidneys) \n\nsince sirolimus is released from temsirolimus in the body. \n- if you have mantle cell lymphoma and liver problems. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Torisel: \n \n- if you are allergic to antihistamines or cannot use antihistamines for other medical reasons. \n\nAntihistamines are given to help prevent an allergic reaction to Torisel, including some life-\nthreatening and rare fatal allergic reactions. Discuss alternatives with your doctor. \n\n- if you have or have had tumours in your brain or spinal cord, bleeding problems or \nbruising, or if you are taking medicines which prevent your blood from clotting (such as \nwarfarin and acenocoumarole). Torisel may lead to a higher risk of bleeding into your brain. \n\n\n\n 37\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking blood thinning medicines or have any bleeding or bruising \nwhile you are on Torisel. \n\n- if you have shortness of breath, cough, and/or fever. Torisel may weaken your immune \nsystem. You may be at risk of getting an infection of the blood, skin, upper respiratory tract \n(including pneumonia), and/or urinary tract while you are taking Torisel. Tell your doctor if \nyou experience new or worsening symptoms, or if you are taking or have recently taken \nmedicines that weaken your immune system. \n\n- if you have or have had inflammation of the lungs. Torisel may cause non-specific \ninterstitial pneumonitis. Some patients did not have symptoms or had minimal symptoms. For \nthis reason, your doctor may recommend a lung assessment by computed tomography scan or \nchest x-ray before and during your Torisel treatment. Promptly tell your doctor of any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. \n\n- if you drink alcohol or are an alcoholic. Torisel contains alcohol and can be harmful to those \nwho drink alcohol or to those suffering from alcoholism. Tell your doctor if you have a \ndrinking problem or consume alcohol (see section \u201cTorisel contains ethanol [alcohol]\u201d). \n\n- if you have or have had kidney problems. Your doctor will monitor your kidney function. \n- if you have or have had liver problems. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following \n\nsigns and symptoms of liver problems during Torisel treatment: itching, yellow eyes or skin, \ndark urine, and pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area. Your doctor will do blood \ntests to check your liver function and then may decide to lower the dose of Torisel. \n\n- if you have or have had high cholesterol levels. Torisel may elevate triglycerides and/or \ncholesterol, and this may require treatment with lipid-lowering agents (medicines used to \nreduce cholesterol in the blood). \n\n- if you are going to have surgery or if you had an operation recently. Torisel may increase \nthe risk of problems with wound healing. You will usually be taken off Torisel if you are \nhaving an operation. Your doctor will decide when to start Torisel again. \n\n- if you are planning to have a vaccination during treatment with Torisel. A vaccination may \nbe less effective or the use of certain vaccinations should be avoided during treatment with \nTorisel. \n\n- if you are over 65 years of age. You may be more likely to have certain side effects, including \nswelling of your face, diarrhoea, pneumonia, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, decreased \nnumber of white cells in the blood, muscle pain, change in the sense of taste, upper respiratory \ninfection, fluid around the lungs, sores and inflammation in the mouth and/or the digestive \ntract, runny nose, dizziness and infections. \n\n- Torisel may increase blood glucose levels and worsen diabetes mellitus. This may result in \nthe need for insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agent therapy. Tell your doctor if you experience \nany excessive thirst or increased frequency and quantity of urination. \n\n- Torisel can decrease the number of blood cells that help in clotting and resisting infection. \nThis may increase the risk of bleeding/bruising and infection (see section \u201cPossible side \neffects\"). \n\n- if you have or have had eye problems like cataracts. Your doctor may prescribe a visual \nexamination before or during Torisel treatment. \n\n- if you are receiving Torisel, you may be at increased risk of cancers such as skin cancers and \nlymph node cancers (lymphoma). \n\n- if you are receiving Torisel, you may be at increased risk of heart attack. Tell your doctor if \nyou experience symptoms such as pain or sensation of pressure in chest, arm, shoulders or jaw, \nshortness of breath, feeling sick (nausea), anxiety, sweating or dizziness. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, nurse if you have any concern. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine is not for children and adolescents below 18 years of age because advanced cancer of \nthe kidney and mantle cell lymphoma are not relevant for these patients, and it did not work in other \ncancers. \n \n\n\n\n 38\n\nOther medicines and Torisel \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \nSome medicines can interfere with the breakdown or metabolism of Torisel and therefore dose \nadjustment of Torisel may be required. In particular, you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are taking any of the following: \n \n- protease inhibitors used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) \n- antibiotics (including rifampicin) or antifungal medicines (including itraconazole, ketoconazole \n\nand voriconazole) used to treat infections \n- nefazodone or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors used to treat depression  \n- anti-epileptic medicines, including carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital \n- rifabutin used to treat infection in people with HIV and other diseases \n- herbal medicines or natural remedies containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) used \n\nto treat mild depression \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril) or a \n\ncalcium channel blocker (such as amlodipine) used to treat high blood pressure or other \ncardiovascular problems \n\n- amphiphilic medicines used to treat heart arrhythmias (such as amiodarone), or statins used to \ntreat high cholesterol \n\n- sunitinib used to treat cancer of the kidney \n- medicines which are P-gp substrates (such as digoxin, vincristine, colchicine, dabigatran, \n\nlenalidomide, paclitaxel) \n \nTorisel with food and drink \n \nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice may increase blood concentrations of Torisel and should be avoided. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. \n \nTorisel has not been studied in pregnant women, and it must not be used during pregnancy, unless \nclearly necessary. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must avoid pregnancy by using an effective method of birth control \nduring treatment with Torisel. Men with partners of childbearing potential should use medically \nacceptable contraception while receiving Torisel. \n \nWomen should not breast-feed during treatment with Torisel, as this medicine may interfere with the \ngrowth and development of the baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTorisel is unlikely to influence the ability to drive and use machines. However, feeling or being sick \n(nausea and vomiting) and difficulty in falling or staying asleep are very common side effects. If you \nfeel sick (nausea and vomiting) or you have difficulty in falling or staying asleep, take special care \nwhen driving or using machines. \n \nFor patients receiving the higher dose of Torisel for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, the \namount of alcohol in this medicine may impair your ability to drive or use machines (see section below \n\u201cTorisel contains ethanol [alcohol]\u201d). \n \n\n\n\n 39\n\nTorisel contains ethanol (alcohol) \n \nThis medicine contains ethanol (alcohol), equivalent to 17.6 ml beer, 7.3 ml wine per 25 mg dose. \nPatients receiving the higher dose of 175 mg of Torisel for the initial treatment of mantle cell \nlymphoma may receive a dose of ethanol equivalent to up to 123 ml beer or 51 ml wine per dose. It is \nharmful if you are suffering from alcoholism, and it is to be taken into account in pregnant or \nbreast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy. \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicine may impair your ability to drive or alter the effects of other \nmedicines (see sections \u201cWarning and precautions\u201d and \u201cDriving and using machines\u201d).  \n \n \n3. How Torisel is given \n \nTorisel will always be prepared and given to you by a doctor or another healthcare professional as an \nintravenous infusion (into your vein). \n \nYou should receive an injection of antihistamine (to try to prevent allergic reaction to Torisel) directly \ninto your vein approximately 30 minutes before your dose of Torisel. \n \nThe Torisel concentrate must first be diluted with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent to achieve a \nconcentration of 10 mg/ml before administration in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection (see dilution instructions at the end of the package leaflet). \n \nFor renal cancer, the recommended dose is 25 mg infused (as a drip) over a 30 to 60 minute period \nonce weekly. \n \nFor mantle cell lymphoma, the recommended dose is 175 mg infused (as a drip) over a \n30- to 60-minute period once weekly for 3 weeks followed by single weekly doses of 75 mg infused \n(as a drip) over a 30- to 60-minute period. \n \nTreatment with Torisel should continue until you are no longer benefiting from therapy or until \nunacceptable side effects occur. \n \nAs this medicine is prepared and given by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely you will be given too \nmuch or that you will miss a dose. \n \nIf you are concerned about this, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects may be more pronounced with the higher dose of 175 mg per week during initial treatment \nfor mantle cell lymphoma. \n \nThe most important side effects you may experience during the treatment with Torisel are listed below. \nIf you experience any of them, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nAllergic reactions \nYou should tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have symptoms of angioedema, such as \nswollen face, tongue or pharynx, and difficulty in breathing. \n \nIf you experience any of these during the administration of Torisel, the doctor or nurse will stop the \ninfusion. \n\n\n\n 40\n\n \nBleeding in the brain \nYou should seek medical advice immediately if you feel confused, unusually tired, have difficulty in \nspeaking or in swallowing and your pupils have different sizes. These symptoms might be caused by a \nbleeding in the brain. \n \nIntestinal puncture, tear or holes \nYou should seek medical advice immediately if you have acute abdominal pain, high fever, nausea \nand vomiting, or blood in the stools. These symptoms might be caused by a perforation in your gut. \n \nKidney failure \nYou should seek medical advice immediately if you suffer from general swelling, shortness of \nbreath, tiredness. These symptoms might be caused by a sudden decrease of kidney function. \n \nEmbolism in the lung \nYou should seek medical advice immediately if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, \ncoughing up blood, fast heartbeat, nausea, fainting, sweating, wheezing, and clammy or bluish skin. \nThese symptoms might be caused by a blood clot in your lung. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor straight away: \n- if you have cough, chest pain, difficulties in breathing. Your doctor may prescribe you an x-ray \n\nexamination of your chest. \n- if the number of white cells in your blood has decreased. This may increase the risk of getting \n\nfever and infections. \n- if the number of platelet (a type of blood cell that helps to clot blood) has decreased. This may \n\nincrease the risk of bleeding in your body. \n- if your blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides have increased. \n- if you experience any excessive thirst or increased frequency and quantity of urination. Your \n\ndoctor may prescribe you insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agent therapy. \n- if you have recently undertaken a surgery. Your doctor may delay the administration of Torisel \n\nuntil the wound is fully recovered as this medicine could interfere with the healing processes of \npre-existing wounds. \n\n \nOther side effects with Torisel may include: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \nGeneral feeling of weakness, chills, swelling due to fluid retention, pain (including abdominal, back, \nchest and joint pain), feeling sick to the stomach (nausea and vomiting), diarrhoea, constipation , \nheadache, fever, sores and inflammation in the mouth and/or the digestive tract, cough, pneumonia, \nnose bleed, rash, itching, dry skin, decreased appetite, shortness of breath, low levels of potassium in \nthe blood (which may cause muscle weakness), low red blood cell count, decreased number of a type \nof white blood cells which is associated with an increased risk of infection, high blood sugar, high \ncholesterol, high triglycerides abscess, infections ( including eye infection, flu, viral infections, \nbronchitis), abnormal kidney function (including kidney failure), blood tests that show changes in the \nway the kidney is working, change in the sense of taste, difficulty falling asleep, low number of \nplatelets which may cause bleeding and bruising. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \nRunny nose, gum redness and swelling, mouth pain (including sores inside the mouth), stomach \nbloating, sore throat, high blood pressure, pink eye including watery eye disorder, taste loss, redness \nand swelling of the follicles in the skin, allergic reactions, severe scaling of the skin, increased blood \nclotting (including thrombosis of the veins), low levels of calcium in the blood, low levels of \nphosphates in the blood, upper respiratory infections, inflammation of the lung, fluid in the chest \ncavity, infection in the blood, dehydration, agitation, depression, numbness and tingling of the skin, \ndizziness, sleepiness, bleeding (from the lips, mouth, stomach or intestines), inflammation of the lining \n\n\n\n 41\n\nof the stomach, trouble with swallowing, skin bleeding (bruising), small pin-point haemorrage, nail \ndisorder, acne, yeast infection, fungal infection, urinary tract infections, cystitis, blood tests that show \nchanges in the way the liver is working, high blood fats other than triglycerides, diabetes, muscle pain. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \nPericardial effusion (fluid around the heart that may require drainage and can affect the pumping of \nblood). \n \nBleeding into the brain in patients with brain tumours or who are on blood thinners, eye bleeding. \n \nEmbolism of the lung, perforation of the gut, problems with wound healing after surgery, \ninflammation and swelling of the voice box. \n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n \nLung infection caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). \n \nSide effects for which frequency is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): \n \nSwelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat, possibly causing difficulty breathing. \n \nSerious reactions of the skin and/or mucous membranes which may include painful blisters and fever \n(Stevens-Johnson syndrome). \n \nUnexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness which could indicate muscle damage \n(rhabdomyolysis) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effect, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine \n \n \n5. How to store Torisel \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date, which is stated on the vial label and carton.

Use a new vial. \n \nDilution \n \nThe concentrate for solution for infusion must be diluted with the supplied solvent before \nadministration in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nNote: For mantle cell lymphoma, multiple vials will be required for each dose over 25 mg. Each vial \nof Torisel must be diluted according to the instructions below. The required amount of \nconcentrate-solvent mixture from each vial must be combined in one syringe for rapid injection into \n250 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nThe concentrate-solvent mixture should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration. \nDo not use if particulates are present, or if discoloured.  \n \nIn preparing the solution, the following two-step process must be carried out in an aseptic manner \naccording to local standards for handling cytotoxic/cytostatic medicines: \n \nSTEP 1: DILUTION OF THE CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION WITH THE \nSUPPLIED SOLVENT \n \n\n\uf0b7 Withdraw 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent. \n\uf0b7 Inject the 1.8 ml of solvent into the vial of Torisel 30 mg concentrate. \n\uf0b7 Mix the solvent and the concentrate well by inversion of the vial. Sufficient time should be \n\nallowed for air bubbles to subside. The solution should be a clear to slightly turbid, colourless \nto light-yellow to yellow solution, essentially free from visual particulates. \n\n \nOne vial of Torisel concentrate contains 30 mg of temsirolimus: when the 1.2 ml concentrate is \ncombined with 1.8 ml of the supplied solvent, a total volume of 3.0 ml is obtained and the \nconcentration of temsirolimus will be 10 mg/ml. The concentrate- solvent mixture is stable below \n25\u00b0C for up to 24 hours. \n \nSTEP 2: ADMINISTRATION OF CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION SOLVENT \n\nMIXTURE IN SODIUM CHLORIDE 9 MG/ML (0.9%) SOLUTION FOR INJECTION \n \n\n\uf0b7 Withdraw the required amount of concentrate-solvent mixture (containing temsirolimus \n10 mg/ml) from the vial; i.e., 2.5 ml for a temsirolimus dose of 25 mg. \n\n\uf0b7 Inject the withdrawn volume rapidly into 250 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \nfor injection to ensure adequate mixing. \n\n \n\n\n\n 45\n\nThe admixture should be mixed by inversion of the bag or bottle, avoiding excessive shaking, as this \nmay cause foaming. \n \nThe final diluted solution in the bag or bottle should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration prior to administration. The admixture of Torisel in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection should be protected from excessive room light and sunlight.  \n \nFor mantle cell lymphoma, multiple vials will be required for each dose over 25 mg. \n \nAdministration \n \n\u2022 Administration of the final diluted solution should be completed within six hours from the time \n\nthat the Torisel is first added to sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n\u2022 Torisel is infused over a 30- to 60-minute period once a week. The use of an infusion pump is the \n\npreferred method of administration to ensure accurate delivery of the medicinal product. \n\u2022 Appropriate administration materials must be used to avoid excessive loss of medicinal product \n\nand to decrease the rate of DEHP extraction. The administration materials must consist of non-\nDEHP, non-PVC tubing with appropriate filter. An in-line polyethersulfone filter with a pore size \nof not greater than 5 microns is recommended for administration to avoid the possibility of \nparticles bigger than 5 microns being infused. If the administration set available does not have an \nin-line filter incorporated, a filter should be added at the end of the set (i.e., an end-filter) before \nthe admixture reaches the vein of the patient.

use torisel: - if you are allergic to temsirolimus, to polysorbate 80 or to any of the other ingredients listed in section 6. - if you are allergic to sirolimus (used to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted kidneys) since sirolimus is released from temsirolimus in the body. - if you have mantle cell lymphoma and liver problems. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving torisel: - if you are allergic to antihistamines or cannot use antihistamines for other medical reasons. antihistamines are given to help prevent an allergic reaction to torisel, including some life- threatening and rare fatal allergic reactions. discuss alternatives with your doctor. - if you have or have had tumours in your brain or spinal cord, bleeding problems or bruising, or if you are taking medicines which prevent your blood from clotting (such as warfarin and acenocoumarole). torisel may lead to a higher risk of bleeding into your brain. tell your doctor if you are taking blood thinning medicines or have any bleeding or bruising while you are on torisel. - if you have shortness of breath, cough, and/or fever. torisel may weaken your immune system. you may be at risk of getting an infection of the blood, skin, upper respiratory tract (including pneumonia), and/or urinary tract while you are taking torisel. tell your doctor if you experience new or worsening symptoms, or if you are taking or have recently taken medicines that weaken your immune system. - if you have or have had inflammation of the lungs. torisel may cause non-specific interstitial pneumonitis. some patients did not have symptoms or had minimal symptoms. for this reason, your doctor may recommend a lung assessment by computed tomography scan or chest x-ray before and during your torisel treatment. promptly tell your doctor of any new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. - if you drink alcohol or are an alcoholic. torisel contains alcohol and can be harmful to those who drink alcohol or to those suffering from alcoholism. tell your doctor if you have a drinking problem or consume alcohol (see section \"torisel contains ethanol [alcohol]\"). - if you have or have had kidney problems. your doctor will monitor your kidney function. - if you have or have had liver problems. tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems during torisel treatment: itching, yellow eyes or skin, dark urine, and pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area. your doctor will do blood tests to check your liver function and then may decide to lower the dose of torisel. - if you have or have had high cholesterol levels. torisel may elevate triglycerides and/or cholesterol, and this may require treatment with lipid-lowering agents (medicines used to reduce cholesterol in the blood). - if you are going to have surgery or if you had an operation recently. torisel may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. you will usually be taken off torisel if you are having an operation. your doctor will decide when to start torisel again. - if you are planning to have a vaccination during treatment with torisel. a vaccination may be less effective or the use of certain vaccinations should be avoided during treatment with torisel. - if you are over 65 years of age. you may be more likely to have certain side effects, including swelling of your face, diarrhoea, pneumonia, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, decreased number of white cells in the blood, muscle pain, change in the sense of taste, upper respiratory infection, fluid around the lungs, sores and inflammation in the mouth and/or the digestive tract, runny nose, dizziness and infections. - torisel may increase blood glucose levels and worsen diabetes mellitus. this may result in the need for insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agent therapy. tell your doctor if you experience any excessive thirst or increased frequency and quantity of urination. - torisel can decrease the number of blood cells that help in clotting and resisting infection. this may increase the risk of bleeding/bruising and infection (see section \"possible side effects\"). - if you have or have had eye problems like cataracts. your doctor may prescribe a visual examination before or during torisel treatment. - if you are receiving torisel, you may be at increased risk of cancers such as skin cancers and lymph node cancers (lymphoma). - if you are receiving torisel, you may be at increased risk of heart attack. tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as pain or sensation of pressure in chest, arm, shoulders or jaw, shortness of breath, feeling sick (nausea), anxiety, sweating or dizziness. talk to your doctor, pharmacist, nurse if you have any concern. children and adolescents this medicine is not for children and adolescents below 18 years of age because advanced cancer of the kidney and mantle cell lymphoma are not relevant for these patients, and it did not work in other cancers. other medicines and torisel tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. some medicines can interfere with the breakdown or metabolism of torisel and therefore dose adjustment of torisel may be required. in particular, you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: - protease inhibitors used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) - antibiotics (including rifampicin) or antifungal medicines (including itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole) used to treat infections - nefazodone or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors used to treat depression - anti-epileptic medicines, including carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital - rifabutin used to treat infection in people with hiv and other diseases - herbal medicines or natural remedies containing st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum) used to treat mild depression - angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (such as enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril) or a calcium channel blocker (such as amlodipine) used to treat high blood pressure or other cardiovascular problems - amphiphilic medicines used to treat heart arrhythmias (such as amiodarone), or statins used to treat high cholesterol - sunitinib used to treat cancer of the kidney - medicines which are p-gp substrates (such as digoxin, vincristine, colchicine, dabigatran, lenalidomide, paclitaxel) torisel with food and drink grapefruit and grapefruit juice may increase blood concentrations of torisel and should be avoided. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. torisel has not been studied in pregnant women, and it must not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary. women of childbearing potential must avoid pregnancy by using an effective method of birth control during treatment with torisel. men with partners of childbearing potential should use medically acceptable contraception while receiving torisel. women should not breast-feed during treatment with torisel, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of the baby. driving and using machines torisel is unlikely to influence the ability to drive and use machines. however, feeling or being sick (nausea and vomiting) and difficulty in falling or staying asleep are very common side effects. if you feel sick (nausea and vomiting) or you have difficulty in falling or staying asleep, take special care when driving or using machines. for patients receiving the higher dose of torisel for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, the amount of alcohol in this medicine may impair your ability to drive or use machines (see section below \"torisel contains ethanol [alcohol]\"). torisel contains ethanol (alcohol) this medicine contains ethanol (alcohol), equivalent to 17.6 ml beer, 7.3 ml wine per 25 mg dose. patients receiving the higher dose of 175 mg of torisel for the initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma may receive a dose of ethanol equivalent to up to 123 ml beer or 51 ml wine per dose. it is harmful if you are suffering from alcoholism, and it is to be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy. the amount of alcohol in this medicine may impair your ability to drive or alter the effects of other medicines (see sections \"warning and precautions\" and \"driving and using machines\").", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "torisel", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":

injection (see dilution instructions at the end of the package leaflet). for renal cancer, the recommended dose is 25 mg infused (as a drip) over a 30 to 60 minute period once weekly. for mantle cell lymphoma, the recommended dose is 175 mg infused (as a drip) over a 30- to 60-minute period once weekly for 3 weeks followed by single weekly doses of 75 mg infused (as a drip) over a 30- to 60-minute period. treatment with torisel should continue until you are no longer benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable side effects occur. as this medicine is prepared and given by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely you will be given too much or that you will miss a dose. if you are concerned about this, tell your doctor immediately. if you have any further questions on the use of
