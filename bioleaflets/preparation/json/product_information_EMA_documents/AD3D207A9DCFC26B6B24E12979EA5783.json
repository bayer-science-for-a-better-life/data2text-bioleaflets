The tablets must be taken with a glass of water within 1 hour after completion \nof the morning and evening meals.   \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBone marrow suppression \n \nLonsurf caused an increase in the incidence of myelosuppression including anaemia, neutropenia, \nleukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.  \n \nComplete blood cell counts must be obtained prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor \ntoxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle.  \n \nTreatment must not be started if the absolute neutrophil count is < 1.5 ×109/L, if the platelet counts are \n<  75×  109/L, or if the patient has an unresolved Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological clinically relevant \ntoxicity from prior therapies.  \n \nSerious infections have been reported following treatment with Lonsurf (see section 4.8). Given that \nthe majority were reported in the context of bone marrow suppression, the patient’s condition should \nbe monitored closely, and appropriate measures, such as antimicrobial agents and granulocyte-colony \nstimulating factor (G-CSF), should be administered as clinically indicated. In RECOURSE and TAGS \nstudies, 9.4% and 17.3% of patients in the Lonsurf group respectively received G-CSF mainly for \ntherapeutic use. \n \nGastrointestinal toxicity \n \nLonsurf caused an increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicities including nausea, vomiting \nand diarrhoea. \n \nPatients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal toxicities should be carefully \nmonitored, and anti-emetic, anti-diarrhoeal and other measures, such as fluid/electrolyte replacement \ntherapy, should be administered as clinically indicated. Dose modifications (delay and/or reduction) \nshould be applied as necessary (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nLonsurf is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n[CrCl] < 15 mL/min or requiring dialysis), as Lonsurf has not been studied in these patients (see \nsection 5.2). \nThe global incidence of adverse events (AEs) is similar in normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min), \nmild (CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl = 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment subgroups. \nHowever, the incidence of serious, severe AEs and AEs leading to dose modification tends to increase \n\n7 \n\n\n\nwith advancing levels of renal impairment. In addition, a higher exposure of trifluridine and tipiracil \nhydrochloride was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment, compared with patients with \nnormal renal function or patients with mild renal impairment (see section 5.2).  \nPatients with severe renal impairment (CrCl = 15 to 29 mL/min) and adjusted starting dose of 20 \nmg/m2 twice daily had a safety profile consistent with the safety profile of Lonsurf in patients with \nnormal renal function or mild renal impairment. Their exposure to trifluridine was similar to that of \npatients with normal renal function and their exposure to tipiracil hydrochloride was increased \ncompared to patients with normal renal function, mild and moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.2). \nPatients with renal impairment should be monitored closely when being treated with Lonsurf; patients \nwith moderate or severe renal impairment should be more frequently monitored for haematological \ntoxicities. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nLonsurf is not recommended for use in patients with baseline moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n(National Cancer Institute [NCI] Criteria Group C and D defined by total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN), as a \nhigher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinaemia is observed in patients with baseline moderate \nhepatic impairment, although this is based on very limited data (see section 5.2). \n \nProteinuria \n \nMonitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting and during therapy \n(see section 4.8). \n \nLactose intolerance \n \nLonsurf contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and 5-[trifluoromethyl] uracil (FTY) \ndid not inhibit the activity of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. In vitro evaluation indicated \nthat trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and FTY had no inductive effect on human CYP isoforms (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that trifluridine is a substrate for the nucleoside transporters CNT1, ENT1 \nand ENT2. Therefore, caution is required when using medicinal products that interact with these \ntransporters. Tipiracil hydrochloride was a substrate for OCT2 and MATE1, therefore, the \nconcentration might be increased when Lonsurf is administered concomitantly with inhibitors of \nOCT2 or MATE1.  \n \nCaution is required when using medicinal products that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., \nzidovudine.  Such medicinal products, if used concomitantly with Lonsurf, may compete with the \neffector, trifluridine, for activation via thymidine kinases.  Therefore, when using antiviral medicinal \nproducts that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the \nantiviral medicinal product, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral medicinal product that is \nnot a human thymidine kinase substrate, such as lamivudine, didanosine and abacavir (see section 5.1). \n \nIt is unknown whether Lonsurf may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, \nwomen using hormonal contraceptive must also use a barrier contraceptive method. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n \n\n8 \n\n\n\nBased on findings in animals, trifluridine may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Lonsurf and for up to 6 months after \nending treatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive \nmeasures while taking Lonsurf and for 6 months after stopping treatment. It is currently unknown \nwhether Lonsurf may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using \nhormonal contraceptives should add a barrier contraceptive method. \nMen with a partner of child-bearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and \nfor up to 6 months after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available data from the use of Lonsurf in pregnant women. Based on the mechanism of \naction, trifluridine is suspected to cause congenital malformations when administered during \npregnancy. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Lonsurf should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Lonsurf. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether Lonsurf or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have \nshown excretion of trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and/or their metabolites in milk (see \nsection 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued \nduring treatment with Lonsurf. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data available on the effects of Lonsurf on human fertility. Results of animal studies did \nnot indicate an effect of Lonsurf on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLonsurf has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness or malaise \nmay occur during treatment (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe most serious observed adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Lonsurf are bone marrow \nsuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥ 30%) in patients receiving Lonsurf are \nneutropenia (53% [34% ≥ Grade 3]), nausea (34% [1% ≥ Grade 3]), fatigue (32% [4% ≥ Grade 3]), \nanaemia (32% [12% ≥ Grade 3]). \n  \nThe most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 2%) in patients receiving Lonsurf that resulted in \ntreatment discontinuation, dose reduction, dose delay, or dose interruption were neutropenia, \nanaemia, leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea and diarrhoea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions \n \nThe adverse drug reactions observed from the 533 treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in \nthe placebo-controlled Phase III (RECOURSE) clinical trial and the 335 treated patients with \nmetastatic gastric cancer in the placebo-controlled Phase III (TAGS) clinical trial, are shown in Table \n6. They are classified according to System Organ Class (SOC) and the appropriate Medical Dictionary \nfor Regulatory (MedDRA) term is used to describe a certain drug reaction and its synonyms and \nrelated conditions. \n \n\n9 \n\n\n\nAdverse drug reactions are grouped according to their frequencies. Frequency groups are defined by \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); and uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to < 1/100).  \n \nWithin each frequency group, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 6 - Adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials in patients treated with Lonsurf  \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \n(MedDRA)a \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Lower respiratory tract \ninfection \n \n \n\nSeptic shockb \nEnteritis infectious \nLung infection \nBiliary tract infection \nInfluenza \nUrinary tract infection \nGingivitis \nHerpes zoster \nTinea pedis \nCandida infection \nBacterial infection \nInfection \nNeutropenic sepsis \nUpper respiratory tract infection \nConjunctivitis \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified (incl. \ncysts and polyps) \n\n  Cancer pain \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia \nLeukopenia \nAnaemia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nFebrile neutropenia \nLymphopenia \n \n\nPancytopenia \nGranulocytopenia \nMonocytopenia \nErythropenia \nLeukocytosis \nMonocytosis \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nDecreased appetite Hypoalbuminaemia \n \n\nDehydration \nHyperglycaemia \nHyperkalaemia \nHypokalaemia \nHypophosphataemia \nHypernatraemia \nHyponatraemia \nHypocalcaemia \nGout \n\nPsychiatric disorders   Anxiety \nInsomnia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dysgeusia \nNeuropathy peripheral \n \n\nNeurotoxicity \nDysaesthesia \nHyperaesthesia \nHypoaesthesia \nSyncope \nParaesthesia \nBurning sensation \nLethargy \nDizziness \nHeadache \n\n10 \n\n\n\nSystem Organ Class \n(MedDRA)a \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nEye disorders   Visual acuity reduced \nVision blurred \nDiplopia \nCataract \nDry eye \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Vertigo \nEar discomfort \n\nCardiac disorders   Angina pectoris \nArrhythmia  \nPalpitations \n\nVascular disorders   Embolism \nHypertension \nHypotension \nFlushing \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspnoea \n \n\nPulmonary embolismb \nPleural effusion \nRhinorrhoea \nDysphonia \nOropharyngeal pain \nEpistaxis \nCough \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea \nNausea \nVomiting \n\nAbdominal pain \nConstipation \nStomatitis \nOral disorder \n\nEnterocolitis haemorrhagic \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \nPancreatitis acute \nAscites \nIleus \nSubileus \nColitis \nGastritis \nReflux gastritis \nOesophagitis \nImpaired gastric emptying \nAbdominal distension \nAnal inflammation \nMouth ulceration \nDyspepsia \nGastrooesophageal reflux disease \nProctalgia \nBuccal polyp \nGingival bleeding \nGlossitis \nPeriodontal disease \nTooth disorder \nRetching \nFlatulence \nBreath odour \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Hyperbilirubinaemia Hepatotoxicity \nBiliary dilatation \n\n11 \n\n\n\nSystem Organ Class \n(MedDRA)a \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia \nsyndromec \nRash \nAlopecia \nPruritus \nDry skin \n\nSkin exfoliation \nUrticaria \nPhotosensitivity reaction \nErythema \nAcne \nHyperhidrosis \nBlister \nNail Disorder \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Joint swelling \nArthralgia \nBone pain \nMyalgia \nMusculoskeletal pain \nMuscular weakness \nMuscle spasms \nPain in extremity \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Proteinuria Renal failure \nCystitis noninfective \nMicturition disorder \nHaematuria \nLeukocyturia \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\n  Menstrual disorder \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFatigue Pyrexia \nOedema \nMucosal inflammation \nMalaise \n\nGeneral physical health \ndeterioration \nPain \nFeeling of body temperature change \nXerosis \nDiscomfort \n\nInvestigations  Hepatic enzyme \nincreased \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \nWeight decreased \n\nBlood creatinine increased \nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged \nInternational normalised ratio \nincreased \nActivated partial thromboplastin \ntime prolonged \nBlood urea increased \nBlood lactate dehydrogenase \nincreased \nProtein total decreased \nC-reactive protein increased \nHaematocrit decreased \n\na.

Hand-foot skin reaction. \n\n \nElderly \n \nPatients 65 years of age or older who received Lonsurf had a higher incidence of the following events \ncompared to patients younger than 65 years: \n- metastatic colorectal cancer (RECOURSE): Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (48% vs 30%), Grade 3 \nanaemia (26% vs 12%), Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (26% vs 18%) and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia \n(9% vs 2%), \n- metastatic gastric cancer (TAGS): Grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decrease (17.0% vs 6.6%), \ndecreased appetite (37.3% vs 31.9%), asthenia (22.2% vs 17.0%) and stomatitis (7.2% vs 2.2%). \n\n12 \n\n\n\n \nInfections \n \nIn the Phase III clinical trials, treatment-related infections occurred more frequently in Lonsurf-treated \npatients (5.8%) compared to those receiving placebo (1.8%). \n \nProteinuria \n \nTreatment-related proteinuria occurred more frequently in Lonsurf-treated patients (1.8%) compared \nto those receiving placebo (0.9%), all of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity (see section 4.4). \n \nRadiotherapy \n \nThere was a slightly higher incidence of overall haematological and myelosuppression-related adverse \nreactions for patients who received prior radiotherapy compared to patients without prior radiotherapy \nin RECOURSE (54.6% versus 49.2%, respectively), of note febrile neutropenia was higher in \nLonsurf-treated patients who received prior radiotherapy vs. those that did not. \n \nPost-marketing experience in patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer \n \nThere have been reports of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving Lonsurf post approval.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest dose of Lonsurf administered in clinical trials was 180 mg/m2 per day. \n \nThe adverse drug reactions reported in association with overdoses were consistent with the established \nsafety profile. \n \nThe primary anticipated complication of an overdose is bone marrow suppression. \n \nThere is no known antidote for an overdose of Lonsurf.  \n \nMedical management of an overdose should include customary therapeutic and supportive medical \nintervention aimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations and preventing their possible \ncomplications. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, ATC code: L01BC59 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLonsurf is comprised of an antineoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, trifluridine, and the \nthymidine phosphorylase (TPase) inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride, at a molar ratio 1:0.5 (weight ratio, \n1:0.471).  \n \n\n13 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nFollowing uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine, is phosphorylated by thymidine kinase, further \nmetabolised in cells to a deoxyribonucleic acid DNA substrate, and incorporated directly into DNA, \nthereby interfering with DNA function to prevent cell proliferation.  \n \nHowever, trifluridine is rapidly degraded by TPase and readily metabolised by a first-pass effect \nfollowing oral administration, hence the inclusion of the TPase inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride.  \n \nIn nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride demonstrated antitumour activity against \nboth 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines.   \n \nThe cytotoxic activity of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride against several human tumour xenografts \ncorrelated highly with the amount of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, suggesting this as the primary \nmechanism of action. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLonsurf had no clinically relevant effect on QT/QTc prolongation compared with placebo in an open \nlabel study in patients with advanced solid tumours. \n  \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic colorectal cancer \n \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Lonsurf were evaluated in an international, randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (RECOURSE) in patients with previously treated metastatic \ncolorectal cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS), and supportive efficacy \nendpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate \n(DCR).  \n \nIn total, 800 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Lonsurf (N = 534) plus best supportive care \n(BSC) or matching placebo (N = 266) plus BSC. Lonsurf dosing was based on BSA with a starting \ndose of 35 mg/m2/dose. Study treatment was administered orally twice daily after morning and \nevening meals for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, followed by 14 days rest, repeated every \n4 weeks. Patients continued therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section \n4.2). \n \nOf the 800 randomised patients, the median age was 63 years, 61% were male, 58% were \nCaucasian/White, 35% were Asian/Oriental, and 1% were Black/African American, and all patients \nhad baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1. The \nprimary site of disease was colon (62%) or rectum (38%). KRAS status was wild (49%) or mutant \n(51%) at study entry. The median number of prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease was 3. All \npatients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based \nchemotherapy. All but 1 patient received bevacizumab, and all but 2 patients with KRAS wild type \ntumours received panitumumab or cetuximab. The 2 treatment groups were comparable with respect to \ndemographic and baseline disease characteristics. \n \nAn OS analysis of the study, carried out as planned at 72% (N = 574) of events, demonstrated a \nclinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit of Lonsurf plus BSC compared to \nplacebo plus BSC (hazard ratio: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.58 to 0.81]; p < 0.0001) and a \nmedian OS of 7.1 months vs 5.3 months, respectively; with 1-year survival rates of 26.6% and 17.6%, \nrespectively. PFS was significantly improved in patients receiving Lonsurf plus BSC (hazard ratio: \n0.48; 95% CI [0.41 to 0.57]; p < 0.0001 (see Table 7, Figure 1 and Figure 2). \n \n\nTable 7 - Efficacy results from the Phase III (RECOURSE) clinical trial in patients with \nmetastatic colorectal cancer  \n\n \n\n14 \n\n\n\n \nLonsurf plus BSC \n\n(N=534) \nPlacebo plus BSC \n\n(N=266) \nOverall Survival \nNumber of deaths, N (%) 364 (68.2) 210 (78.9) \nMedian OS (months)a [95% CI]b 7.1 [6.5, 7.8] 5.3 [4.6, 6.0] \nHazard ratio [95% CI] 0.68 [0.58, 0.81] \nP-valuec < 0.0001 (1-sided and 2-sided) \nProgression-Free Survival \nNumber of Progression or Death, \nN (%) 472 (88.4) 251 (94.4) \nMedian PFS (months)a [95% CI]b 2.0 [1.9, 2.1] 1.7 [1.7, 1.8] \nHazard ratio [95% CI] 0.48 [0.41, 0.57] \nP-valuec <0.0001 (1-sided and 2-sided) \na Kaplan-Meier estimates \nb Methodology of Brookmeyer and Crowley \nc Stratified log-rank test (strata: KRAS status, time since diagnosis of first metastasis, region) \n \n\n15 \n\n\n\nFigure 1- Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival in patients with metastatic \ncolorectal cancer \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAn updated OS analysis, carried out at 89% (N = 712) of events, confirmed the clinically meaningful \nand statistically significant survival benefit of Lonsurf plus BSC compared to placebo plus BSC \n(hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% CI [0.59 to 0.81]; p < 0.0001) and a median OS of 7.2 months vs 5.2 months; \nwith 1-year survival rates of 27.1% and 16.6%, respectively.  \n \nThe OS and PFS benefit was observed consistently, in all relevant pre-specified subgroups, including \nrace, geographic region, age (< 65; ≥ 65), sex, ECOG PS, KRAS status, time since diagnosis of first \nmetastasis, number of metastatic sites, and primary tumour site. The Lonsurf survival benefit  was \nmaintained after adjusting for all significant prognostic factors, namely, time since diagnosis of first \nmetastasis, ECOG PS and number of metastatic sites (hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% CI [0.58 to 0.81]). \n \n\nHazard ratio for progression or death, 0.48 (95% CI, 0.41-0.57) \nP<0.0001 by log-rank test \n\nLonsurf Lonsurf\nPlacebo \n\nMonths from Randomisation \n\nPlacebo Placebo\nLonsurf Lonsurf\n\nNo. at Risk: \n\nPr\nog\n\nre\nss\n\nio\nn-\n\nfr\nee\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n) \n\nMonths from Randomisation \n\nPlacebo \n\nHazard ratio for death, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.58-0.81) \nP<0.0001 \n\nPlacebo\n\nSu\nrv\n\niv\nal\n\n P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n) \n\nPlacebo\nLonsurf \n\nPlacebo\nLonsurfLonsurf\n\nNo. at Risk: \n\n16 \n\n\n\nSixty one percent (61%, N = 485) of all randomised patients received a fluoropyrimidine as part of \ntheir last treatment regimen prior to randomisation, of which 455 (94%) were refractory to the \nfluoropyrimidine at that time. Among these patients, the OS benefit with Lonsurf was maintained \n(hazard ratio: 0.75, 95% CI [0.59 to 0.94]).  \n \nEighteen percent (18%, N = 144) of all randomised patients received regorafenib prior to \nrandomisation. Among these patients, the OS benefit with Lonsurf was maintained (hazard ratio: 0.69, \n95% CI [0.45 to 1.05]). The effect was also maintained in regorafenib-naive patients (hazard ratio: \n0.69, 95% CI [0.57 to 0.83]). \n \nThe DCR (complete response or partial response or stable disease) was significantly higher in patients \ntreated with Lonsurf (44% vs 16%, p < 0.0001). \n \nTreatment with Lonsurf plus BSC resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of PS <2 in \ncomparison to placebo plus BSC. The median time to PS ≥ 2 for the Lonsurf group and placebo group \nwas 5.7 months and 4.0 months, respectively, with a hazard ratio  of 0.66 (95% CI: [0.56, 0.78]), \np < 0.0001. \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Lonsurf were evaluated in an international, randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (TAGS) in patients with previously treated metastatic gastric \ncancer (including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction), who had been previously treated \nwith at least two prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease, including fluoropyrimidine-, \nplatinum-, and either taxane- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy, plus if appropriate human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -targeted therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival \n(OS), and supportive efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate \n(ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to deterioration of ECOG performance status ≥2 and Quality \nof Life (QoL). Tumor assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours \n(RECIST), version 1.1, were performed by the investigator/local radiologist every 8 weeks. \n \nIn total, 507 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Lonsurf (N = 337) plus best supportive care \n(BSC) or  placebo (N = 170) plus BSC. Lonsurf dosing was based on BSA with a starting dose of \n35 mg/m2/dose. Study treatment was administered orally twice daily after morning and evening meals \nfor 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, followed by 14 days rest, repeated every 4 weeks. \nPatients continued therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 4.2). \n \nOf the 507 randomised patients, the median age was 63 years, 73% were male, 70% were White, 16% \nwere Asian, and <1% were Black/African American, and all patients had baseline Eastern Cooperative \nOncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1. Primary cancer was gastric (71.0%) or \ngastroesophageal junction cancer (28.6%) or both (0.4%). The median number of prior regimens of \ntherapy for metastatic disease was 3. Nearly all (99.8%) patients received prior fluoropyrimidine, \n100% received prior platinum therapy and 90.5% received prior taxane therapy. Approximately half \n(55.4%) of patients received prior irinotecan, 33.3% received prior ramucirumab, and 16.6% received \nprior HER2-targeted therapy. The 2 treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic \nand baseline disease characteristics. \n \nAn OS analysis of the study, carried out as planned at 76% (N = 384) of events, demonstrated that \nLonsurf plus BSC resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to placebo plus \nBSC with an hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.85; 1- and 2-sided p-values were 0.0003 and \n0.0006, respectively) corresponding to a 31% reduction in the risk of death in the Lonsurf group. The \nmedian OS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.2) for the Lonsurf group versus 3.6 months (95% CI: 3.1, \n4.1) for the placebo group; with 1-year survival rates of 21.2% and 13.0%, respectively.  \nPFS was significantly improved in patients receiving Lonsurf plus BSC compared to placebo plus \nBSC (HR of 0.57; 95% CI [0.47 to 0.70]; p < 0.0001 (see Table 8, Figure 3 and Figure 4). \n \n\n17 \n\n\n\nTable 8 - Efficacy results from the Phase III (TAGS) clinical trial in patients with metastatic \ngastric cancer \n\n \n\n \nLonsurf plus BSC \n\n(N=337) \nPlacebo plus BSC \n\n(N=170) \nOverall Survival \nNumber of deaths, N (%) 244 (72.4) 140 (82.4) \nMedian OS (months)a [95% CI]b 5.7 [4.8, 6.2] 3.6 [3.1, 4.1] \nHazard ratio [95% CI] 0.69 [0.56, 0.85] \nP-valuec 0.0003 (1-sided), 0.0006 (2-sided) \nProgression-Free Survival \nNumber of Progression or Death, \nN (%) \n\n287 (85.2) \n \n\n156 (91.8) \n\nMedian PFS (months)a [95% CI]b 2.0 [1.9, 2.3] 1.8 [1.7, 1.9] \nHazard ratio [95% CI] 0.57 [0.47, 0.70] \nP-valuec <0.0001 (1-sided and 2-sided) \na Kaplan-Meier estimates \nb Methodology of Brookmeyer and Crowley \nc Stratified log-rank test (strata: region, ECOG status at baseline, prior  ramucirumab treatment) \n \nFigure 3- Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in patients with metastatic gastric cancer \n \n\n \n \n\nMonths from Randomisation \n\nPlacebo \n\nHazard ratio for death, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.56-0.85) \nP=0.0003 (1-sided) ; p =0.0006 (2-sided) \n\nPlacebo\n\nSu\nrv\n\niv\nal\n\n P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n) \n\nPlacebo\nLonsurf \n\nPlaceboPlacebo\nLonsurf LonsurfLonsurf\n\nNo. at Risk: \n\n18 \n\n\n\nFigure 4 - Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival in patients with metastatic gastric \ncancer \n\n \n\n \n \nThe OS and PFS benefit was observed consistently, in all randomization strata and across most pre-\nspecified subgroups, including sex, age (< 65; ≥ 65 years), ethnic origin, ECOG PS, prior \nramucirumab treatment, prior irinotecan treatment, number of prior regimens (2; 3; ≥ 4), previous \ngastrectomy, primary tumour site (gastric; gastroesophageal junction) and HER2 status. \nThe ORR (complete response + partial response) was not significantly higher in patients treated with \nLonsurf (4.5% vs 2.1 %, p-value = 0.2833) but the DCR (complete response or partial response or \nstable disease) was significantly higher in patients treated with Lonsurf (44.1% vs 14.5%, p < 0.0001). \nThe median time to deterioration of ECOG performance status to ≥2 was 4.3 months for the Lonsurf \ngroup versus 2.3 months for the placebo group with HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.562, 0.854), \np-value = 0.0005.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nLonsurf in all subsets of the paediatric population in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer and in \nrefractory metastatic gastric cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nElderly \n \nThere is limited data in Lonsurf treated patients aged 75 years and above (87 patients (10%) in pooled \ndata of the RECOURSE and TAGS studies, of which 2 patients were 85 years or older). The effect of \nLonsurf on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years and ≥65 years of age. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration of Lonsurf with [14C]-trifluridine, at least 57% of the administered \ntrifluridine was absorbed and only 3% of the dose was excreted into faeces. After oral administration \nof Lonsurf with [14C]-tipiracil hydrochloride, at least 27% of the administered tipiracil hydrochloride \nwas absorbed and 50% of the total radioactivity dose measured into faeces, suggestive of moderate \ngastrointestinal absorption of tipiracil hydrochloride. \nFollowing a single dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the mean \ntimes to peak plasma concentrations (tmax) of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were around 2 \nhours and 3 hours, respectively. \n \n\nMonths from Randomisation \n\nHazard ratio for progression or death, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.47-0.70) \nP<0.0001 (1-sided and 2-sided) \n\nLonsurf Lonsurf\nPlacebo \n\nPlacebo \n\nPr\nog\n\nre\nss\n\nio\nn-\n\nfr\nee\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n) \n\nPlaceboPlacebo\nLonsurf LonsurfLonsurf\n\nNo. at Risk: \n\n19 \n\n\n\nIn the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses of the multiple dose administration of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose, \ntwice daily for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks followed by a 14-day rest, repeated every 4 \nweeks), trifluridine area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable \nconcentration (AUC0-last) was approximately 3-fold higher and maximum concentration (Cmax) was \napproximately 2-fold higher after multiple dose administration (Day 12 of Cycle 1) of Lonsurf than \nafter single-dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1). \n \nHowever, there was no accumulation for tipiracil hydrochloride, and no further accumulation of \ntrifluridine with successive cycles (Day 12 of Cycles 2 and 3) of administration of Lonsurf.  Following \nmultiple doses of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose twice daily) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the \nmean times to peak plasma concentrations (tmax) of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were around \n2 hours and 3 hours, respectively. \n \nContribution of tipiracil hydrochloride \n \nSingle-dose administration of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2/dose) increased the mean AUC0-last of trifluridine by \n37-fold and Cmax by 22-fold with reduced variability compared to trifluridine alone (35 mg/m2/dose). \n \nEffect of food \n \nWhen Lonsurf at a single dose of 35 mg/m2 was administered to 14 patients with solid tumours after a \nstandardised high-fat, high-calorie meal, trifluridine area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) \ndid not change, but trifluridine Cmax, tipiracil hydrochloride Cmax and AUC decreased by \napproximately 40% compared to those in a fasting state.  In clinical studies Lonsurf was administered \nwithin 1 hour after completion of the morning and evening meals (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nThe protein binding of trifluridine in human plasma was over 96% and trifluridine bound mainly to \nhuman serum albumin. Plasma protein binding of tipiracil hydrochloride was below 8%. Following a \nsingle dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the apparent volume of \ndistribution (Vd/F) for trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride was 21 L and 333 L, respectively.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTrifluridine was mainly eliminated by metabolism via TPase to form an inactive metabolite, FTY. The \nabsorbed trifluridine was metabolised, and excreted into urine as FTY and trifluridine glucuronide \nisomers. Other minor metabolites, 5-carboxyuracil  and 5-carboxy-2’-deoxyuridine,  were detected, \nbut those levels in plasma and urine were at low or trace levels. \n \nTipiracil hydrochloride was not metabolised in human liver S9 or in cryopreserved human \nhepatocytes. Tipiracil hydrochloride was the major component and 6-hydroxymethyluracil was the \nmajor metabolite consistently in human plasma, urine, and faeces. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing the multiple-dose administration of Lonsurf at the recommended dose and regimen, the \nmean elimination half-life (t1/2) for trifluridine on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and on Day 12 of Cycle 1 were 1.4 \nhours and 2.1 hours, respectively.  The mean t1/2 values for tipiracil hydrochloride on Day 1 of Cycle 1 \nand on Day 12 of Cycle 1 were 2.1 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively. \n \nFollowing a single dose of Lonsurf (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumours, the oral \nclearance (CL/F) for trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were 10.5 L/hr and 109 L/hr, respectively. \nAfter single oral administration of Lonsurf with [14C]-trifluridine, the total cumulative excretion of \nradioactivity was 60% of the administered dose. The majority of recovered radioactivity was \neliminated into urine (55% of the dose) within 24 hours, and the excretion into faeces and expired air \nwas less than 3% for both. After single oral administration of Lonsurf with [14C]-tipiracil \n\n20 \n\n\n\nhydrochloride, recovered radioactivity was 77% of the dose, which consisted of 27% urinary excretion \nand 50% faecal excretion. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn a dose finding study (15 to 35 mg/m2 twice daily), the AUC from time 0 to 10 hours (AUC0-10) of \ntrifluridine tended to increase more than expected based on the increase in dose; however, oral \nclearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of trifluridine were generally constant at \nthe dose range of 20 to 35mg/m2.  As for the other exposure parameters of trifluridine and tipiracil \nhydrochloride, those appeared to be dose proportional. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, gender and race \n \nBased on the population PK analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender or race on the \nPK of trifluridine or tipiracil hydrochloride. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nOf the 533 patients in the RECOURSE study who received Lonsurf, 306 (57%) patients had normal \nrenal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min), 178 (33%) patients had mild renal impairment (CrCl 60 to \n89 mL/min), and 47 (9%) had moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min), with data missing \nfor 2 patients. Patients with severe renal impairment were not enrolled in the study.  \nBased on a population PK analysis, the exposure of Lonsurf in patients with mild renal impairment \n(CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) was similar to those in patients with normal renal function \n(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min). A higher exposure of Lonsurf was observed in moderate renal impairment (CrCl \n= 30 to 59 mL/min). Estimated (CrCl) was a significant covariate for CL/F in both final models of \ntrifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride. The mean relative ratio of AUC in patients with mild (n=38) \nand moderate (n=16) renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function (n=84) were \n1.31 and 1.43 for trifluridine, respectively, and 1.34 and 1.65 for tipiracil hydrochloride, respectively. \n  \nIn a dedicated study the pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were evaluated in \ncancer patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥90 mL/min, N=12), mild renal impairment (CrCl \n=60 to 89 mL/min, N=12), moderate renal impairment (CrCl =30 to 59 mL/min, N=11), or severe \nrenal impairment (CrCl =15 to 29 mL/min, N=8). Patients with severe renal impairment received an \nadjusted starting dose of 20 mg/m2 twice daily (reduced to 15 mg/m2 twice daily based on individual \nsafety and tolerability). The effect of renal impairment after repeated administration was a 1.6- and \n1.4-fold increase of trifluridine total exposure in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, \nrespectively, compared to patients with normal renal function; Cmax remained similar. The total \nexposure of tipiracil hydrochloride in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment after \nrepeated administration was 2.3- and 4.1-fold higher, respectively, compared to patients with normal \nrenal function; this being linked to a more decreased clearance with increasing renal impairment. The \nPK of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride have not been studied in patients with end-stage renal \ndisease (CrCl < 15 mL/min or requiring dialysis) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on the population PK analysis, liver function parameters including alkaline phosphatase (ALP, \n36-2322 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 11-197 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 5-182 \nU/L) , and total bilirubin (0.17-3.20 mg/dL) were not significant covariates for PK parameters of either \ntrifluridine or tipiracil hydrochloride. Serum albumin was found to significantly affect trifluridine \nclearance, with a negative correlation. For low albumin values ranging from 2.2 to 3.5 g/dL, the \ncorresponding clearance values range from 4.2 to 3.1 L/h. \nIn a dedicated study the PK of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride were evaluated in cancer patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment (National Cancer Institute [NCI] Criteria Group B and C, \nrespectively) and in patients with normal hepatic function. Based upon limited data with a \n\n21 \n\n\n\nconsiderable variability, no statistically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics \nin patients with normal hepatic function versus patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No \ncorrelation was seen for trifluridine nor tipiracil hydrochloride between PK parameters and AST \nor/and total blood bilirubin. Half-life time (t1/2) and the accumulation ratio of trifluridine and tipiracil \nhydrochloride were similar between the moderate, mild and normal hepatic function patients. \nThere is no need for a starting dose adjustment in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section \n4.2). \n \nGastrectomy \n \nThe influence of gastrectomy on PK parameters was not able to be examined in the population PK \nanalysis because there were few patients who had undergone gastrectomy (1% of overall). \n \nIn vitro interaction studies  \n \nTrifluridine is a substrate of TPase, but is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP). Tipiracil \nhydrochloride is not metabolised in either human liver S9 or cryopreserved hepatocytes. \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that trifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and FTY (inactive metabolite of \ntrifluridine) did not inhibit the CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5). In vitro evaluation indicated that \ntrifluridine, tipiracil hydrochloride and FTY had no inductive effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or \nCYP3A4/5. Thus trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride are not expected to cause or be subject to a \nsignificant medicinal product interaction mediated by CYP. \n \nIn vitro evaluation of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride was conducted using human uptake and \nefflux transporters (trifluridine with MDR1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP; tipiracil hydrochloride \nwith OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, MDR1 and BCRP). Neither trifluridine nor tipiracil \nhydrochloride was an inhibitor of or substrate for human uptake and efflux transporters based on in \nvitro studies, except for OCT2 and MATE1. Tipiracil hydrochloride was an inhibitor of OCT2 and \nMATE1 in vitro, but at concentrations substantially higher than human plasma Cmax at steady state. \nThus it is unlikely to cause an interaction with other medicinal products, at recommended doses, due \nto inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1. Transport of tipiracil hydrochloride by OCT2 and MATE1 might \nbe affected when Lonsurf is administered concomitantly with inhibitors of OCT2 and MATE1. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Lonsurf in metastatic colorectal cancer was compared between a high-\nexposure group (>median) and a low-exposure group (≤median) based on the median AUC value of \ntrifluridine. OS appeared more favourable in the high AUC group compared to the low AUC group \n(median OS of 9.3 vs. 8.1 months, respectively). All AUC groups performed better than placebo \nthroughout the follow-up period. The incidences of Grade ≥3 neutropenia were higher in the high-\ntrifluridine AUC group (47.8%) compared with the low-trifluridine AUC group (30.4%). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity \n \nToxicology assessment of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride was performed in rats, dogs and \nmonkeys. The target organs identified were the lymphatic and haematopoietic systems and the \ngastrointestinal tract. All changes, i.e., leukopenia, anaemia, bone marrow hypoplasia, atrophic \nchanges in the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues and the gastrointestinal tract, were reversible \nwithin 9 weeks of drug withdrawal. Whitening, breakage, and malocclusion were observed in teeth of \nrats treated with trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride, which are considered rodent specific and not \nrelevant for human.  \n \nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \n\n22 \n\n\n\n \nNo long term studies evaluating the carcinogenic potential of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride in \nanimals have been performed. Trifluridine was shown to be genotoxic in a reverse mutation test in \nbacteria, a chromosomal aberration test in mammal-cultured cells, and a micronucleus test in mice. \nTherefore, Lonsurf should be treated as a potential carcinogen. \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nResults of animal studies did not indicate an effect of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride on male \nand female fertility in rats. The increases in the corpus luteum count and implanting embryo count \nobserved in female rats at high doses were not considered adverse (see section 4.6). Lonsurf has been \nshown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats when given at dose \nlevels lower than the clinical exposure. No peri/post-natal developmental toxicity studies have been \nperformed. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may experience. See the end of \nSection 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine - because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you experience any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See Section 4. \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Lonsurf is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Lonsurf  \n3. How to take Lonsurf \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lonsurf \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Lonsurf is and what it is used for  \n \nLonsurf is a type of cancer chemotherapy which belongs to the group of medicines called \"cytostatic \nantimetabolite medicines\". \n \nLonsurf contains two different active substances: trifluridine and tipiracil. \n• Trifluridine stops the growth of cancer cells.   \n• Tipiracil stops the trifluridine from being broken down by the body, helping trifluridine to work \n\nlonger. \n \nLonsurf is used to treat adults with colon or rectal cancer - sometimes called ‘colorectal’ cancer and \nstomach cancer (including cancer of the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach).  \n• It is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.  \n• It is used when other treatments have not worked - or when other treatments are not suitable for \n\nyou. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Lonsurf \n \nDo not take Lonsurf :  \n• if you are allergic to trifluridine or tipiracil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nDo not take Lonsurf if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking \nLonsurf. \n\n  \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lonsurf if: \n• you have kidney problems \n\n36 \n\n\n\n• you have liver problems \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lonsurf.  \n \nTreatment may lead to the following side effects (see section 4): \n•  a reduced number of certain types of white blood cells (neutropenia) which are important for \n\nprotecting the body against bacterial or fungal infections. As a consequence of neutropenia, fever \n(febrile neutropenia) and blood infection (septic shock) may occur  \n\n• a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia)  \n• a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop \n\nbleeding and work by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries  \n• gastrointestinal problems. \n\nTests and checks \nYour doctor will do blood tests before each cycle of Lonsurf. You start a new cycle every 4 weeks. \nThe tests are needed because Lonsurf can sometimes affect your blood cells. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. This is \nbecause it may not work or be safe. \n\nOther medicines and Lonsurf \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Lonsurf can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect \nthe way Lonsurf works. \nIn particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines used for treatment of HIV, such \nas zidovudine. This is because zidovudine may not work as well if you are taking Lonsurf. Talk to \nyour doctor about whether to switch to a different HIV medicine. \nIf the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLonsurf. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Lonsurf may harm your \nunborn baby.  \nIf you become pregnant, you and your doctor will have to decide if the benefits of Lonsurf are greater \nthan the risk of harm to the baby.  \nDo not breast-feed if you are taking Lonsurf as it is not known whether Lonsurf passes into the \nmother’s milk. \n \nContraception \nYou must not become pregnant while taking this medicine. This is because it may harm your unborn \nbaby.  \nYou and your partner should use effective methods of contraception while taking this medicine. You \nshould also do this for 6 months after you stop taking the medicine. If you or your partner becomes \npregnant during this time, you must talk to your doctor or pharmacist straight away. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether Lonsurf changes your ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use any \ntools or machines if you experience symptoms that affect your ability to concentrate and react.  \n \nLonsurf contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Lonsurf \n\n37 \n\n\n\n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \n• Your doctor will decide the right dose for you - the dose depends on your weight and height and if \n\nyou have kidney problems.  \n• Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take each time. \n• You will take a dose 2 times a day.  \n\n \nHow to take \nYou will take Lonsurf for 10 days during the first 2 weeks, and then have 2 weeks off. This 4 week \nperiod is called a ‘cycle.’ The specific dosing schedule is as follows: \n• Week 1  \n\n- take the dose 2 times a day for 5 days  \n- then have 2 days off - no medicine \n\n• Week 2  \n- take the dose 2 times a day for 5 days  \n- then have 2 days off - no medicine \n\n• Week 3 \n- No medicine \n\n• Week 4 \n- No medicine \n\nYou will then start again with another cycle of 4 weeks following the above pattern. \n \nLonsurf comes in two strengths. Your doctor may prescribe both strengths for your prescribed dose. \n \nTaking this medicine \n• Take this medicine by mouth. \n• Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. \n• Take within 1 hour after your morning and evening meal. \n• Wash your hands after handling this medicine. \n\n \nIf you take more Lonsurf than you should \nIf you take more Lonsurf than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take  your \npack(s) of medicine with you.  \n \nIf you forget to take Lonsurf \n• If you forget a dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n• Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
