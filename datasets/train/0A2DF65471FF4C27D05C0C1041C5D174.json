PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \n \nWhite to off-white lyophilized powder or cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBortezomib SUN as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or \ndexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who \nhave received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n \nBortezomib SUN in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose \nchemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n \nBortezomib SUN in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is \nindicated for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma \nwho are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n \nBortezomib SUN in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is \nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are \nunsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nBortezomib SUN treatment must be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of cancer patients, however Bortezomib SUN may be administered by a healthcare \nprofessional experienced in use of chemotherapeutic agents. Bortezomib SUN must be reconstituted \nby a healthcare professional (see section 6.6). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nPosology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one \nprior therapy) \n \nMonotherapy \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day \ntreatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. It is recommended that patients \nreceive 2 cycles of Bortezomib SUN following a confirmation of a complete response. It is also \nrecommended that responding patients who do not achieve a complete remission receive a total of \n8 cycles of Bortezomib SUN therapy. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of \nBortezomib SUN. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy \nBortezomib SUN treatment must be withheld at the onset of any Grade 3 non-haematological or any \nGrade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4).  \nOnce the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, Bortezomib SUN treatment may be re-initiated at a \n25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2; 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the toxicity \nis not resolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of Bortezomib SUN must be \nconsidered unless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk. \n \nNeuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy \nPatients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to be \nmanaged as presented in Table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy may \nbe treated with Bortezomib SUN only after careful risk/benefit assessment. \n \nTable 1: Recommended* posology modifications for bortezomib-related neuropathy \nSeverity of neuropathy Posology modification \nGrade 1 (asymptomatic; loss of deep tendon \nreflexes or paresthesia) with no pain or loss of \nfunction \n\nNone \n\nGrade 1 with pain or Grade 2 (moderate \nsymptoms; limiting instrumental Activities of \nDaily Living (ADL)**) \n\nReduce Bortezomib SUN to 1.0 mg/m2 \nor \n\nChange Bortezomib SUN treatment schedule to \n1.3 mg/m2 once per week \n\nGrade 2 with pain or Grade 3 (severe symptoms; \nlimiting self care ADL***) \n\nWithhold Bortezomib SUN treatment until \nsymptoms of toxicity have resolved. When \ntoxicity resolves re-initiate Bortezomib SUN \ntreatment and reduce dose to 0.7 mg/m2 once per \nweek. \n\nGrade 4 (life-threatening consequences; urgent \nintervention indicated) \nand/or severe autonomic neuropathy \n\nDiscontinue Bortezomib SUN \n\n* Based on posology modifications in Phase II and III multiple myeloma studies and post-marketing experience. Grading \nbased on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria CTCAE v 4.0. \n\n** Instrumental ADL: refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using telephone, managing money, etc; \n***Self care ADL: refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medicinal products, and \n\nnot bedridden. \n \nCombination therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day \ntreatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse \nbetween consecutive doses of Bortezomib SUN. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPegylated liposomal doxorubicin is administered at 30 mg/m2 on day 4 of the Bortezomib SUN \ntreatment cycle as a 1 hour intravenous infusion administered after the Bortezomib SUN injection. \nUp to 8 cycles of this combination therapy can be administered as long as patients have not \nprogressed and tolerate treatment. Patients achieving a complete response can continue treatment for \nat least 2 cycles after the first evidence of complete response, even if this requires treatment for more \nthan 8 cycles. Patients whose levels of paraprotein continue to decrease after 8 cycles can also \ncontinue for as long as treatment is tolerated and they continue to respond. \nFor additional information concerning pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, see the corresponding \nSummary of Product Characteristics. \n \nCombination with dexamethasone \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21 day \ntreatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse \nbetween consecutive doses of Bortezomib SUN. \nDexamethasone is administered orally at 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the Bortezomib \nSUN treatment cycle. \nPatients achieving a response or a stable disease after 4 cycles of this combination therapy can \ncontinue to receive the same combination for a maximum of 4 additional cycles. \nFor additional information concerning dexamethasone, see the corresponding Summary of Product \nCharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments for combination therapy for patients with progressive multiple myeloma \nFor Bortezomib SUN dosage adjustments for combination therapy follow dose modification \nguidelines described under monotherapy above. \n \nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplantation \nCombination therapy with melphalan and prednisone \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection in combination with oral \nmelphalan and oral prednisone as shown in Table 2. A 6-week period is considered a treatment cycle. \nIn Cycles 1-4, Bortezomib SUN is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32. \nIn Cycles 5-9, Bortezomib SUN is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. At least \n72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of Bortezomib SUN. \nMelphalan and prednisone should both be given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first week of each \nBortezomib SUN treatment cycle. \nNine treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered. \n \nTable 2: Recommended posology for Bortezomib SUN in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nTwice weekly Bortezomib SUN (cycles 1-4) \nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6 \nBzmb \n\n(1.3 mg/m2) \nDay     --       --     Day \n\n1                         4 \nDay    Day \n\n8       11 \nRest \n\nperiod \nDay    Day  \n22       25 \n\nDay    Day \n29      32 \n\nRest \nperiod \n\nM (9 mg/m2) \nP (60 mg/m2) \n\nDay    Day    Day    Day  \n1        2        3        4 \n\n \n\n--       -- Rest \nperiod \n\n--        -- --         -- Rest \nperiod \n\nOnce weekly Bortezomib SUN (cycles 5-9) \nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6 \nBzmb \n\n(1.3 mg/m2) \nDay     --       --            -- \n\n      1 \nDay 8 Rest \n\nperiod \nDay 22 Day 29 Rest \n\nperiod \nM (9 mg/m2) \nP (60 mg/m2) \n\nDay    Day    Day    Day  \n1        2        3        4 \n\n \n\n-- Rest \nperiod \n\n--  Rest \nperiod \n\nBzmb=Bortezomib SUN; M=melphalan, P=prednisone \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for combination therapy with \nmelphalan and prednisone \nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: \n- Platelet counts should be \u2265 70 x 109/l and the absolute neutrophils count should be \u2265 1.0 x 109/l \n- Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline \n \nTable 3: Posology modifications during subsequent cycles of Bortezomib SUN therapy in combination \n\nwith melphalan and prednisone \n \nToxicity Posology modification or delay \nHaematological toxicity during a cycle \n- If prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia with \nbleeding is observed in the previous cycle \n\nConsider reduction of the melphalan dose by 25% \nin the next cycle. \n\n- If platelet counts \u2264 30 x 109/l or ANC \n\u2264 0.75 x 109/l on a Bortezomib SUN dosing \nday (other than day 1) \n\nBortezomib SUN therapy should be withheld \n\n- If several Bortezomib SUN doses in a cycle \nare withheld (\u2265 3 doses during twice \nweekly administration or \u2265 2 doses during \nweekly administration) \n\nBortezomib SUN dose should be reduced by 1 \ndose level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or \nfrom 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2) \n\nGrade \u2265 3 non-haematological toxicities Bortezomib SUN therapy should be withheld \nuntil symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to \nGrade 1 or baseline. Then, Bortezomib SUN \nmay be reinitiated with one dose level \nreduction (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from \n1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). For bortezomib-related \nneuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, \nhold and/or modify Bortezomib SUN as \noutlined in Table 1. \n\n \nFor additional information concerning melphalan and prednisone, see the corresponding Summary of \nProduct Characteristics. \n \nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients eligible for haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplantation (induction therapy) \nCombination therapy with dexamethasone \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day \ntreatment cycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse \nbetween consecutive doses of Bortezomib SUN. \nDexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Bortezomib \nSUN treatment cycle. \nFour treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered. \n \nCombination therapy with dexamethasone and thalidomide \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 28-day \ntreatment cycle. This 4-week period is considered a treatment cycle. \nAt least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of Bortezomib SUN. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Bortezomib \nSUN treatment cycle. \nThalidomide is administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14 and if tolerated the dose is increased \nto 100 mg on days 15-28, and thereafter may be further increased to 200 mg daily from cycle 2 (see \nTable 4). \nFour treatment cycles of this combination are administered. It is recommended that patients with at \nleast partial response receive 2 additional cycles. \n \nTable 4: Posology for Bortezomib SUN combination therapy for patients with previously untreated \nmultiple myeloma eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation \n \nBzmb+ Dx Cycles 1 to 4 \n\nWeek 1 2 3 \nBzmb (1.3 mg/m2) Day 1, 4 Day 8, 11 Rest period \nDx 40 mg Day 1,2,3,4 Day 8, 9, 10, 11 - \n\nBzmb+Dx+T Cycle 1 \nWeek 1 2 3 4 \nBzmb (1.3 mg/m2) Day 1, 4 Day 8, 11 Rest period  Rest period \nT 50 mg Daily Daily - - \nT 100 mga - - Daily Daily \nDx 40 mg Day 1, 2, 3, 4 Day 8, 9, 10, 11 - - \n\nCycles 2 to 4b \nBzmb (1.3 mg/m2) Day 1, 4 Day 8, 11 Rest period Rest period \nT 200 mga Daily Daily Daily Daily \nDx 40 mg Day 1, 2, 3, 4 Day 8, 9, 10, 11 - - \n\nBzmb=Bortezomib SUN; Dx=dexamethasone; T=thalidomide \na Thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg from week 3 of cycle 1 only if 50 mg is tolerated and to 200 mg from cycle 2 \nonwards if 100 mg is tolerated. \nb Up to 6 cycles may be given to patients who achieve at least a partial response after 4 cycles \n \nDosage adjustments for transplant eligible patients \nFor Bortezomib SUN dosage adjustments, dose modification guidelines described for monotherapy \nshould be followed. \nIn addition, when Bortezomib SUN is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal \nproducts, appropriate dose reductions for these products should be considered in the event of toxicities \naccording to the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nPosology for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) \nCombination therapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (BzmbR-CAP) \nBortezomib SUN is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a \n10-day rest period on days 12-21. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. Six Bortezomib \nSUN cycles are recommended, although for patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two \nadditional Bortezomib SUN cycles may be given. At least 72 hours should elapse between \nconsecutive doses of Bortezomib SUN. \n \nThe following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each Bortezomib SUN 3 week \ntreatment cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 \nand doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2.  \nPrednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Bortezomib SUN \ntreatment cycle. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma \nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy: \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n- Platelet counts should be \u2265 100,000 cells/\u03bcl and the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) should \nbe \u2265 1,500 cells/\u03bcl \n\n- Platelet counts should be \u2265 75,000 cells/\u03bcl in patients with bone marrow infiltration or splenic \nsequestration \n\n- Haemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dl \n- Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. \n \nBortezomib SUN treatment must be withheld at the onset of any \u2265 Grade 3 bortezomib-related \nnon-haematological toxicities (excluding neuropathy) or \u2265 Grade 3 haematological toxicities (see also \nsection .4). For dose adjustments, see Table 5 below. \nGranulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to \nlocal standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be \nconsidered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration. Platelet transfusion for the treatment of \nthrombocytopenia should be considered when clinically appropriate. \n \nTable 5: Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell \nlymphoma \nToxicity Posology modification or delay \nHaematological toxicity \n- \u2265 Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 \n\nneutropenia lasting more than 7 days, a \nplatelet count < 10,000 cells/\u03bcl \n\nBortezomib SUN therapy should be withheld for \nup to 2 weeks until the patient has an ANC \n\u2265 750 cells/\u03bcl and a platelet count \n\u2265 25,000 cells/\u03bcl. \n- If, after Bortezomib SUN has been held, the \n\ntoxicity does not resolve, as defined above, \nthen Bortezomib SUN must be discontinued. \n\n- If toxicity resolves i.e. patient has an ANC \n\u2265 750 cells/\u03bcl and a platelet count \n\u2265 25,000 cells/\u03bcl, Bortezomib SUN may be \nreinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level \n(from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from \n1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). \n\n- If platelet counts < 25,000 cells/\u03bcl. or ANC \n< 750 cells/\u03bcl on a Bortezomib SUN dosing \nday (other than Day 1 of each cycle) \n\nBortezomib SUN therapy should be withheld \n\nGrade \u2265 3 non-haematological toxicities \nconsidered to be related to Bortezomib SUN \n\nBortezomib SUN therapy should be withheld \nuntil symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to \nGrade 2 or better. Then, Bortezomib SUN may be \nreinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level \n(from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to \n0.7 mg/m2). For bortezomib-related neuropathic \npain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or \nmodify Bortezomib SUN as outlined in Table 1. \n\n \nIn addition, when Bortezomib SUN is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal \nproducts, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the event \nof toxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age \nwith multiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nThere are no studies on the use of bortezomib in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple \nmyeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \nTherefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population. \nIn a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients \nexposed to bortezomib were in the range 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years of age, respectively. In patients \naged \u2265 75 years, both regimens, BzmbR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per the \nrecommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on \nBortezomib SUN at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a \nsubsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered \nbased on patient tolerability (see Table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nTable 6: Recommended starting dose modification for Bortezomib SUN in patients with hepatic \nimpairment \nGrade of hepatic \nimpairment* \n\nBilirubin level SGOT (AST) levels Modification of starting dose \n\nMild \u2264 1.0 x ULN > ULN None \n> 1.0 x \u2013 1.5 x ULN Any None \n\nModerate  > 1.5 x \u2013 3 x ULN Any Reduce Bortezomib SUN to \n0.7 mg/m2 in the first treatment \ncycle. Consider dose escalation \nto 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose \nreduction to 0.5 mg/m2 in \nsubsequent cycles based on \npatient tolerability. \n\nSevere > 3 x ULN Any \n\nAbbreviations: SGOT=serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; \nAST=aspartate aminotransferase; ULN=upper limit of the normal range. \n* Based on NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group classification for categorising hepatic impairment (mild, \n\nmoderate, severe). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are not influenced in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (Creatinine Clearance [CrCL] > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2); therefore, dose adjustments are not \nnecessary for these patients. It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced in \npatients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). Since \ndialysis may reduce bortezomib concentrations, Bortezomib SUN should be administered after the \ndialysis procedure (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of bortezomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nBortezomib SUN is available for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. \n \nBortezomib SUN should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death. \n \nIntravenous injection \nBortezomib SUN reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection \nthrough a peripheral or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n(0.9%) solution for injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of \nBortezomib SUN. \n \nSubcutaneous injection \nBortezomib SUN reconstituted solution is administered subcutaneously through the thighs (right or \nleft) or abdomen (right or left). The solution should be injected subcutaneously, at a 45-90\u00b0 angle. \nInjection sites should be rotated for successive injections. \n \nIf local injection site reactions occur following Bortezomib SUN subcutaneous injection, either a less \nconcentrated Bortezomib SUN solution (bortezomib 3.5 mg to be reconstituted to 1 mg/ml instead of \n2.5 mg/ml) may be administered subcutaneously or a switch to intravenous injection is recommended. \n \nWhen Bortezomib SUN is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the Summary \nof Product Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nAcute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease. \n \nWhen Bortezomib SUN is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their \nSummaries of Product Characteristics for additional contraindications. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen Bortezomib SUN is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of \ntreatment with Bortezomib SUN. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing \nand prevention requirements is needed (see section 4.6). \n \nIntrathecal administration \nThere have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of bortezomib. Bortezomib SUN \nis for intravenous or subcutaneous use. Bortezomib SUN should not be administered intrathecally. \n \nGastrointestinal toxicity \nGastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common \nwith bortezomib treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). \nTherefore, patients who experience constipation should be closely monitored. \n \nHaematological toxicity \nBortezomib treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities (thrombocytopenia, \nneutropenia and anaemia).  \nIn studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib and in patients with \npreviously untreated MCL treated with bortezomib in combination with rituximab, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BzmbR-CAP), one of the most common \nhaematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. Platelets were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle \nof bortezomib treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. There was no evidence \nof cumulative thrombocytopenia. The mean platelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of \nbaseline in the single-agent multiple myeloma studies and 50% in the MCL study. In patients with \nadvanced myeloma the severity of thrombocytopenia was related to pre-treatment platelet count: for \nbaseline platelet counts < 75,000/\u03bcl, 90% of 21 patients had a count \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study, \nincluding 14% < 10,000/\u03bcl; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count > 75,000/\u03bcl, only 14% of \n309 patients had a count \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of \nGrade \u2265 3 thrombocytopenia in the bortezomib treatment group (BzmbR-CAP) as compared to the \nnon-bortezomib treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and \nprednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence of \nall-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the BzmbR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well as \nGrade 3 and higher bleeding events (BzmbR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In \nthe BzmbR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients \nin the R-CHOP group. \n \nGastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with bortezomib \ntreatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of bortezomib. \nBortezomib therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/\u03bcl or in combination with \nmelphalan and prednisone when the platelet count is \u2264 30,000/\u03bcl (see section 4.2). Potential benefit of \nthe treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in case of moderate to severe \nthrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding. \n \nComplete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently \nmonitored throughout treatment with bortezomib. Platelet transfusion should be considered when \nclinically appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with no \nevidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of bortezomib \ntreatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, colony \nstimulating factor support was given to 78% of patients in the BzmbR-CAP arm and 61% of patients \nin the R-CHOP arm. Since patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, they should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte colony stimulating \nfactors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. \nProphylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered in case of repeated \ndelays in cycle administration (see section 4.2). \n \nHerpes zoster virus reactivation \nAntiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with bortezomib. In the Phase III \nstudy in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence of herpes zoster \nreactivation was more common in patients treated with Bortezomib+Melphalan+Prednisone compared \nwith Melphalan+Prednisone (14% versus 4% respectively). \nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the \nBzmbR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection \nWhen rituximab is used in combination with bortezomib, HBV screening must always be performed \nin patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis B and \npatients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of \nactive HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment with bortezomib. \nAntiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nrituximab for more information. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nVery rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML \nand death, have been reported in patients treated with bortezomib. Patients diagnosed with PML had \nprior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within \n12 months of their first dose of bortezomib. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for any \nnew or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of the \ndifferential diagnosis of CNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nreferred to a specialist in PML and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. \nDiscontinue bortezomib if PML is diagnosed. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nTreatment with bortezomib is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is \npredominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory \nperipheral neuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early in \nthe treatment and has been observed to peak during cycle 5. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a burning \nsensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. \n \nIn the Phase III study comparing bortezomib administered intravenously versus subcutaneously, the \nincidence of Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% for the subcutaneous injection group \nand 41% for the intravenous injection group (p=0.0124). Grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in \n6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 16% in the intravenous treatment \ngroup (p=0.0264). The incidence of all grade peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib administered \nintravenously was lower in the historical studies with bortezomib administered intravenously than in \nstudy MMY-3021. \n \nPatients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo neurological \nevaluation and may require a change in the dose, schedule or route of administration to subcutaneous \n(see section 4.2). Neuropathy has been managed with supportive care and other therapies. \n \nEarly and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological \nevaluation should be considered in patients receiving bortezomib in combination with medicinal \nproducts known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose reduction or \ntreatment discontinuation should be considered. \n \nIn addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some \nadverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on \nautonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited. \n \nSeizures \nSeizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or epilepsy. \nSpecial care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures. \n \nHypotension \nBortezomib treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse \nreactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who \ndeveloped orthostatic hypotension on bortezomib (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of \northostatic hypotension prior to treatment with bortezomib. Most patients required treatment for their \northostatic hypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced syncopal \nevents. Orthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of bortezomib. The \nmechanism of this event is unknown although a component may be due to autonomic neuropathy. \nAutonomic neuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may aggravate an underlying \ncondition such as diabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised when treating patients with a \nhistory of syncope receiving medicinal products known to be associated with hypotension; or who are \ndehydrated due to recurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension \nmay include adjustment of antihypertensive medicinal products, rehydration or administration of \nmineralocorticosteroids and/or sympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical \nadvice if they experience symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells.  \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of PRES in patients receiving bortezomib. PRES is a rare, often reversible, \nrapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, \nlethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, \npreferably Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients \ndeveloping PRES, bortezomib should be discontinued. \n \nHeart failure \nAcute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left \nventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be a \npredisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or existing \nheart disease should be closely monitored. \n \nElectrocardiogram investigations \nThere have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not been \nestablished. \n \nPulmonary disorders \nThere have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology \nsuch as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome \n(ARDS) in patients receiving bortezomib (see section 4.8). Some of these events have been fatal. A \npre-treatment chest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential post-treatment \npulmonary changes. \n \nIn the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic \nevaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio should be \nconsidered prior to continuing bortezomib therapy. \n \nIn a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous \ninfusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and bortezomib for relapsed acute myelogenous leukaemia \ndied of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, this specific \nregimen with concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous \ninfusion over 24 hours is not recommended. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal impairment \nshould be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with bortezomib at reduced \ndoses and closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic reactions \nRare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving bortezomib and concomitant \nmedicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic reactions \ninclude increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may be \nreversible upon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8). \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nBecause bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells and MCL cells, \nthe complications of tumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome \nare those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and \nappropriate precautions taken. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \nPatients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors. Caution should be exercised when bortezomib is combined with CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 \nsubstrates (see section 4.5). \n \nNormal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving oral \nhypoglycemics (see section 4.5). \n \nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions \nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis \nwith rash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib should \nbe discontinued if serious reactions occur. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes \n1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to the metabolism \nof bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect the overall \ndisposition of bortezomib. \n \nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the \npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase \nof 35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be \nclosely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \nketoconazole, ritonavir). \n \nIn a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on \nthe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients. \n \nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the \npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction \nof 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong \nCYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John\u2019s Wort) is \nnot recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. \n \nIn the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 \ninducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients. \n \nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the pharmacokinetics \nof bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on \ndata from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant. \n \nDuring clinical trials, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were uncommonly and commonly reported in \ndiabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving \nbortezomib treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of \nthe dose of their antidiabetics. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nMale and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures during \nand for 3 months following treatment. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \nPregnancy \nNo clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The \nteratogenic potential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated. \n \nIn non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and rabbits \nat the highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of bortezomib on \nparturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). Bortezomib should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \nbortezomib. \nIf bortezomib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this \nmedicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus.  \n \nThalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth \ndefects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential \nunless all the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. Patients \nreceiving bortezomib in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention \nprogramme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of thalidomide for \nadditional information. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \nadverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nbortezomib. \n \nFertility \nFertility studies were not conducted with bortezomib (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBortezomib may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Bortezomib may \nbe associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope uncommonly and \northostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, patients must be cautious \nwhen driving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if they \nexperience these symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nSerious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with bortezomib include cardiac \nfailure, tumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy. The most \ncommonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with bortezomib are nausea, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, peripheral \nneuropathy (including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, rash, herpes \nzoster and myalgia. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nMultiple myeloma \nUndesirable effects in Table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or \nprobable causal relationship to bortezomib. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data \nset of 5,476 patients of whom 3,996 were treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in \nTable 7. \nOverall, bortezomib was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are \ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. Table 7 has been generated using Version 14.1 of the MedDRA. \nPost-marketing adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials are also included. \n \nTable 7: Adverse reactions in patients with Multiple

bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 in \ncombination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BzmbR-CAP) versus \n242 patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone \n[R-CHOP] was relatively consistent to that observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main \ndifferences described below. Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of \nthe combination therapy (BzmbR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia \n(1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse \ndrug reactions are not attributable to bortezomib alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient \npopulation as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a \u2265 5% higher incidence of \nthe haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nlymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hair \ndisorders. \nAdverse drug reactions identified as those with a \u2265 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the \nBzmbR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the \nBzmbR-CAP arm, are listed in Table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in \nthe BzmbR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable \ncausal relationship to bortezomib based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping.

The \nincidence of herpes zoster among patients in the BzmbR-CAP arm was 10.7% for patients not \nadministered antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3.6% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis \n(see section 4.4). \n \nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection \nMantle cell lymphoma \nHBV infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients in the non-bortezomib \ntreatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP ) \nand 0.4% (n=1) of patients receiving bortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, and prednisone (BzmbR-CAP). The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections was \nsimilar in patients treated with BzmbR-CAP or with R-CHOP (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively). \n \nPeripheral neuropathy in combination regimens \nMultiple myeloma \nIn trials in which bortezomib was administered as induction treatment in combination with \ndexamethasone (study IFM-2005-01), and dexamethasone-thalidomide (study MMY-3010), the \nincidence of peripheral neuropathy in the combination regimens is presented in the table below:  \n \nTable 9: Incidence of peripheral neuropathy during induction treatment by toxicity and treatment \n\ndiscontinuation due to peripheral neuropathy \n IFM-2005-01 MMY-3010 \n\nVDDx \n(N=239) \n\nBzmbDx \n(N=239) \n\nTDx \n(N=126) \n\nBzmbTDx \n(N=130) \n\nIncidence of PN (%)     \nAll GradePN 3 15 12 45 \n\u2265 Grade 2 PN 1 10 2 31 \n\u2265 Grade 3 PN <1 5 0 5 \n\nDiscontinuation due to \nPN (%) \n\n<1 2 1 5 \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nVDDx=vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone; BzmbDx=bortezomib, dexamethasone; TDx=thalidomide, dexamethasone; \nBzmbTDx=bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone; PN=peripheral neuropathy \nNote: Peripheral neuropathy included the preferred terms: neuropathy peripheral, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral \nsensory neuropathy, and polyneuropathy. \n \nMantle cell lymphoma \nIn study LYM-3002 in which bortezomib was administered with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CAP), the incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the combination \nregimens is presented in the table below: \n \nTable 10: Incidence of peripheral neuropathy in study LYM-3002 by toxicity and treatment \n\ndiscontinuation due to peripheral neuropathy \n \n BzmbR-CAP \n\n(N=240) \nR-CHOP \n(N=242) \n\nIncidence of PN (%)   \nAll GradePN 30 29 \n\u2265 Grade 2 PN 18 9 \n\u2265 Grade 3 PN 8 4 \n\nDiscontinuation due to PN (%) 2 < 1 \nBzmbR-CAP=bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone; R-CHOP= rituximab, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; PN=peripheral neuropathy \nPeripheral neuropathy included the preferred terms: peripheral sensory neuropathy, neuropathy peripheral, peripheral \nmotor neuropathy, and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy \n \nElderly MCL patients \n42.9% and 10.4% of patients in the BzmbR-CAP arm were in the range 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years of \nage, respectively. Although in patients aged \u2265 75 years, both BzmbR-CAP and R-CHOP were less \ntolerated, the serious adverse event rate in the BzmbR-CAP groups was 68%, compared to 42% in the \nR-CHOP group. \n \nNotable differences in the safety profile of bortezomib administered subcutaneously versus \nintravenously as single agent \nIn the Phase III study patients who received bortezomib subcutaneously compared to intravenous \nadministration had 13% lower overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse reactions that were \nGrade 3 or higher in toxicity, and a 5% lower incidence of discontinuation of bortezomib. The overall \nincidence of diarrhoea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, asthenic conditions, upper respiratory \ntract infections and peripheral neuropathies were 12%-15% lower in the subcutaneous group than in \nthe intravenous group. In addition, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathies was \n10% lower, and the discontinuation rate due to peripheral neuropathies 8% lower for the subcutaneous \ngroup as compared to the intravenous group. \n \nSix percent of patients had an adverse local reaction to subcutaneous administration, mostly redness. \nCases resolved in a median of 6 days, dose modification was required in two patients. Two (1%) of \nthe patients had severe reactions; 1 case of pruritus and 1 case of redness. \n \nThe incidence of death on treatment was 5% in the subcutaneous treatment group and 7% in the \nintravenous treatment group. Incidence of death from \u201cProgressive disease\u201d was 18% in the \nsubcutaneous group and 9% in the intravenous group. \n \nRetreatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma \nIn a study in which bortezomib retreatment was administered in 130 patients with relapsed multiple \nmyeloma, who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib-containing regimen, the most \ncommon all-grade adverse events occurring in at least 25% of patients were thrombocytopenia (55%), \nneuropathy (40%), anaemia (37%), diarrhoea (35%), and constipation (28%). All grade peripheral \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nneuropathy and grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 40% and 8.5% of patients, \nrespectively. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute onset \nof symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical \ncardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, see section 5.3. \n \nThere is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the \npatient\u2019s vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood \npressure (such as fluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX32. \n \nMechanism of action \nBortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like \nactivity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex \nthat degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in \nregulating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition \nof the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades \nwithin the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. \n \nBortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 \u03bcM concentrations, bortezomib does not \ninhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more \nselective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome inhibition \nwere evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome with a t\u00bd of \n20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible. \n \nBortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but \nnot limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor \nkappa B (NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. \nNF-kB is a transcription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, \nincluding cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, \nbortezomib affects the ability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.  \n \nExperiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and that \ncancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal cells. \nBortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour models, including \nmultiple myeloma. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nData from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast \ndifferentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in \npatients with multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with \nbortezomib. \n \nClinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma \nA prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 \nVISTA) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected \nintravenously) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in \nimprovement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone \n(60 mg/m2) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a \nmaximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity. The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% were male, 88% \nwere Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80. Patients \nhad IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median hemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a \nmedian platelet count of 221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients had creatinine clearance \n\u226430 ml/min (3% in each arm). \nAt the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, time to progression, was met and \npatients in the M+P arm were offered Bzmb+M+P treatment. Median follow-up was 16.3 months. \nThe final survival update was performed with a median duration of follow-up of 60.1 months. A \nstatistically significant survival benefit in favour of the Bzmb+M+P treatment group was observed \n(HR=0.695; p=0.00043) despite subsequent therapies including bortezomib-based regimens. Median \nsurvival for the Bzmb+M+P treatment group was 56.4 months compared to 43.1 for the M+P \ntreatment group.

Patients in the BzmbDx group received four \n21 day cycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly on \ndays 1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in Cycles 1 \nand 2, and on days 1 to 4 in Cycles 3 and 4). \nAutologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in the \nVDDx and BzmbDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant \nprocedure. Patient demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the \ntreatment groups. Median age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of \npatients had high-risk cytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx \ngroup and 11 weeks for the BzmbDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nwas 4 cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR). \nA statistically significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the bortezomib combined \nwith dexamethasone group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included post-transplant response rates \n(CR+nCR, CR+nCR+VGPR+PR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival.

Patient demographic and baseline disease \ncharacteristics were similar between the treatment groups. Patients in the BzmbTDx and TDx groups \nrespectively had a median age of 57 versus 56 years, 99% versus 98% patients were Caucasians, and \n58% versus 54% were males.

As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at the \nrecommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to dexamethasone \nwere then offered bortezomib, regardless of disease status. Due to this early crossover, the median \nduration of follow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients who were refractory to \ntheir last prior therapy and those who were not refractory, overall survival was significantly longer \nand response rate was significantly higher on the bortezomib arm. \n \nOf the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well as \nTTP remained significantly better for bortezomib independently of age. Regardless of \n\u03b22-microglobulin levels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (time to progression and overall survival, \nas well as response rate) were significantly improved on the bortezomib arm. \n \nIn the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent \nreview committee and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow Transplant \nGroup. The median survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ months). This \nsurvival was greater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by consultant clinical \ninvestigators for a similar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response rate was \nindependent of myeloma type, performance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the number or \ntype of previous therapies. Patients who had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had a response \nrate of 32% (10/32) and patients who received greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens had a \nresponse rate of 31% (21/67). \n \nTable 14: Summary of disease outcomes from the Phase III (APEX) and Phase II studies \n \n Phase III Phase III Phase III Phase II \n All patients 1 prior line of therapy \n\n> 1 prior line of \ntherapy \n\n\u2265 2 prior \nlines  \n\nTime related \nevents \n\nBzmb \nn=333a \n\nDex \nn=336a \n\nBzmb \nn=132a \n\nDex \nn=119a \n\nBzmb \nn=200a \n\nDex \nn=217a \n\nBzmb \nn=202a \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n Phase III Phase III Phase III Phase II \n All patients 1 prior line of therapy \n\n> 1 prior line of \ntherapy \n\n\u2265 2 prior \nlines  \n\nTTP, days \n[95% CI] \n\n189b \n[148, 211] \n\n106b \n[86, 128] \n\n212d \n[188, \n267] \n\n169d \n[105, \n191] \n\n148b \n[129, \n192] \n\n87b \n[84, 107] \n\n210 \n[154, \n281] \n\n1 year survival, \n% \n\n[95% CI] \n80d \n\n[74,85] \n66d \n\n[59,72] \n89d \n\n[82,95] \n72d \n\n[62,83] \n73 \n\n[64,82] \n62 \n\n[53,71] 60 \nBest response \n\n(%) \nBzmb \nn=315c \n\nDex \nn=312c \n\nBzmb \nn=128 \n\nDex \nn=110 \n\nBzmb \nn=187 \n\nDex \nn=202 \n\nBzmb \nn=193 \n\nCR 20 (6)b 2 (<1)b 8 (6) 2 (2) 12 (6) 0 (0) (4)** \nCR+nCR 41 (13)b 5 (2)b 16 (13) 4 (4) 25 (13) 1 (<1) (10)** \n\nCR+nCR+PR 121 (38)b 56 (18)b 57 (45)d 29 (26)d 64 (34)b 27 (13)b (27)** \nCR+nCR+PR+M\n\nR \n146 (46) 108 (35) 66 (52) 45 (41) 80 (43) 63 (31) (35)**  \n\nMedian \nduration \n\nDays (months) \n\n242 (8.0) 169 (5.6) 246 (8.1) 189 (6.2) 238 (7.8) 126 (4.1) 385* \n\nTime to \nresponse \n\nCR+PR(days) \n\n43 43 44 46 41 27 38* \n\na Intent to Treat (ITT) population \nb p-value from the stratified log-rank test; analysis by line of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic history; p < \n0.0001 \nc Response population includes patients who had measurable disease at baseline and received at least 1 dose of study \nmedicinal product. \nd p-value from the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test adjusted for the stratification factors; analysis by line of therapy \nexcludes stratification for therapeutic history \n* CR+PR+MR **CR=CR, (IF-); nCR=CR (IF+) \nNA=not applicable, NE=not estimated \nTTP-Time to Progression \nCI=Confidence Interval \nBzmb=bortezomib; Dex=dexamethasone \nCR=Complete Response; nCR=near Complete response \nPR=Partial Response; MR=Minimal response \n \nIn the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with bortezomib \nalone were able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with bortezomib.

A total of 74 evaluable patients were administered dexamethasone in combination with \nbortezomib. Eighteen percent of patients achieved, or had an improved response [MR (11%) or PR \n(7%)] with combination treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy with subcutaneous administration of bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory \nmultiple myeloma \nAn open label, randomised, Phase III non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of the \nsubcutaneous administration of bortezomib versus the intravenous administration. This study included \n222 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to \nreceive 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib by either the subcutaneous or intravenous route for 8 cycles. Patients \nwho did not obtain an optimal response (less than Complete Response [CR]) to therapy with \nbortezomib alone after 4 cycles were allowed to receive dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and \nafter bortezomib administration. Patients with baseline Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet \ncounts < 50,000/\u03bcl were excluded. A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nThis study met its primary objective of non-inferiority for response rate (CR+PR) after 4 cycles of \nsingle agent bortezomib for both the subcutaneous and intravenous routes, 42% in both groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint \nwas TTP while the secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), using the European \nGroup for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. \nA protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination for \nefficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45% (95% CI; 29-57%, p < 0.0001) for \npatients treated with combination therapy of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The \nmedian TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for \nthe bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. These results, \nthough not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis. \nThe final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant \ndifference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; \n28.9-37.1 months) for the bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy \npatients. \n \nBortezomib combination treatment with dexamethasone \nIn the absence of any direct comparison between bortezomib and bortezomib in combination with \ndexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis was \nconducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of bortezomib in combination with \ndexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the bortezomib \nmonotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL \nMMY-3001) in the same indication.  \nThe matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. \nbortezomib in combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. \nbortezomib) are made comparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study \nsubjects. This minimises the effects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects using \nnon-randomised data. \nOne hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis demonstrated \nimproved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS (hazard ratio 0.511; \n95% CI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; p=0.001) for \nbortezomib in combination with dexamethasone over bortezomib monotherapy. \n \nLimited information on bortezomib retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available.  \nPhase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine \nthe efficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib. One hundred and thirty patients (\u2265 18 years of \nage) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib-containing \nregimen were retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior therapy, bortezomib was \nstarted at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or \u2264 1.0 mg/m2 (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 \nand 11 every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent or in combination with \ndexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in \ncombination with bortezomib to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving \ndexamethasone during the course of bortezomib retreatment cycles. \nThe primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. The \noverall best response rate (CR + PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4).  \n \nClinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) \nStudy LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of \nthe combination of bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone \n(BzmbR-CAP; n=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and \nprednisone (R-CHOP; n=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). \nPatients in the BzmbR-CAP treatment arm received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest \nperiod days 12-21), rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the \n21 day bortezomib treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two \nadditional treatment cycles were given. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on Independent Review \nCommittee (IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included, time to progression (TTP), time to next \nanti-lymphoma treatment (TNT), duration of treatment free interval (TFI), overall response rate \n(ORR) and complete response (CR/CRu) rate, overall survival (OS) and response duration. \n \nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the two \ntreatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% \nAsian, 69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for \nMCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of \u2265 3, and 76% had Stage IV \ndisease. Treatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up (median=40 months) were \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\ncomparable in both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received by patients in both treatment \narms with 14% of subjects in the BzmbR-CAP group and 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group \nreceiving 2 additional cycles. The majority of the patients in both groups completed treatment, 80% in \nthe BzmbR-CAP group and 82% in the R-CHOP group.

A statistically significant benefit \n(p < 0.001) in favour of the BzmbR-CAP treatment group over the R-CHOP group was observed for \nTTP (median 30.5 versus 16.1 months), TNT (median 44.5 versus 24.8 months) and TFI (median 40.6 \nversus 20.5 months). The median duration of complete response was 42.1 months in the BzmbR-CAP \ngroup compared with 18 months in the R-CHOP group. The duration of overall response was \n21.4 months longer in the BzmbR-CAP group (median 36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the \nR-CHOP group). With a median duration of follow-up of 40 months, median OS (56.3 months in the \nR-CHOP group, and not reached in the BzmbR-CAP group) favoured the BzmbR-CAP group, \n(estimated HR=0.80; p=0.173). There was a trend towards prolonged overall survival favouring the \nBzmbR-CAP group; the estimated 4-year survival rate was 53.9% in the R-CHOP group and 64.4% in \nthe BzmbR-CAP group. \n \nPatients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis \nAn open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of \nbortezomib in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety concerns \nwere observed during the study, and in particular bortezomib did not exacerbate target organ damage \n(heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate (including a \n28.6% CR rate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 evaluable \npatients treated with the maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 twice-weekly. \nFor these dose cohorts, the combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nbortezomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell \nlymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nA Phase II, single arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children\u2019s \nOncology Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi agent re induction \nchemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective \nreinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. Bortezomib was \nadministered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered \ndrugs in Block 3. \n \nComplete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within \n18 months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free \nsurvival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18 36 months from diagnosis \n(n = 33) the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% \n(95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, \n86) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported efficacy data are \nconsidered inconclusive (see section 4.2). \n \nThere were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 years \n(range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to the standard \npaediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions (Grade \u2265 3) were \nobserved at a higher incidence in the bortezomib containing treatment regimen as compared with a \nhistorical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory \nneuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% versus 2%). No information on \npossible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were available in this study. Higher \nincidences were also noted for infections with Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and \n22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus \n6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and \n4% versus 0 in Block 2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with \nmultiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose \nmaximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent \ndoses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the \n1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose. \n \nFollowing an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m2 dose to patients with \nmultiple myeloma (n=14 in the intravenous group, n=17 in the subcutaneous group), the total \nsystemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUClast) was equivalent for subcutaneous and \nintravenous administrations. The Cmax after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/ml) was lower than \nintravenous (223 ng/ml). The AUClast geometric mean ratio was 0.99 and 90% confidence intervals \nwere 80.18%-122.80%. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nDistribution \nThe mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- or \nrepeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple \nmyeloma. This suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib \nconcentration range of 0.01 to 1.0 \u03bcg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human \nplasma. The fraction of bortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 \nisozymes indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 \nenzymes, 3A4, 2C19, and 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two \ndeboronated metabolites that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. \nDeboronated-bortezomib metabolites are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors. \n \nElimination \nThe mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours. \nBortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. Mean \ntotal body clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and \n1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent doses for \ndoses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I \nstudy during the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying \ndegrees of hepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2. \n \nWhen compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter dose-\nnormalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were increased by \napproximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is \nrecommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those patients should be \nclosely monitored (see section 4.2, Table 6). \n \nRenal impairment \nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who \nwere classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups: \nNormal (CrCL \u2265 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL=40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate \n(CrCL=20-39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of \ndialysis patients who were dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were \nadministered intravenous doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib twice weekly. Exposure of \nbortezomib (dose-normalised AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see section 4.2). \n \nAge \nThe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus \nadministration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 paediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic \nleukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, \nclearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area (BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) \nclearance was 7.79 (25%) l/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) l/m2, and the \nelimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics \nsuch as age, body weight and sex did not have clinically significant effects on bortezomib clearance. \nBSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the in vitro \nchromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations as low as \n3.125 \u03bcg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not genotoxic when \ntested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus assay in mice. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally \ntoxic doses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies were \nnot performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity \nstudies. In the 6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have been \nobserved. It is, therefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or female \nfertility. Peri- and postnatal development studies were not conducted. \n \nIn multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs \nincluded the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and \nlymphatic tissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and \nhaematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice and \ndogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs have \nshown partial to full recovery following discontinuation of treatment. \n \nBased on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to be \nlimited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown. \n \nCardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses \napproximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated with \nincreases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the decreased \ncardiac contractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive inotropic or \npressor agents. \nMoreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Bortezomib SUN is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Bortezomib SUN \n3. How to use Bortezomib SUN \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Bortezomib SUN \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Bortezomib SUN is and what it is used for \n \nBortezomib SUN contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called \u2018proteasome inhibitor\u2019. \nProteasomes play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with their \nfunction, bortezomib can kill cancer cells. \n \nBortezomib SUN is used for the treatment of: \n- multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients older than 18 years: \n - alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, \n\nfor patients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior \ntreatment and for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is \nunsuitable. \n\n- in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease \nhas not been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with \nblood stem cell transplantation. \n\n- in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with \nthalidomide, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before \nreceiving high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction \ntreatment). \n\n- mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph nodes) in patients 18 years or \nolder in combination with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and \nprednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and for whom blood \nstem cell transplantation is unsuitable. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Bortezomib SUN \n \nYou should NOT be given Bortezomib SUN \n- if you are allergic to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n- if you have certain severe lung or heart problems. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nYou should tell your doctor if you have any of the following: \n- low numbers of red or white blood cells \n- bleeding problems and/or low number of platelets in your blood \n- diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting \n- fainting, dizziness or light-headedness in the past \n- kidney problems \n- moderate to severe liver problems \n- numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet (neuropathy) in the past \n- heart or blood pressure problems \n- shortness of breath or cough \n- seizures \n- shingles (localised including around the eyes or spread across the body) \n- symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome such as muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, \n\nvisual loss or disturbances and shortness of breath \n- memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty with walking or loss of vision. These may be signs of \n\na serious brain infection and your doctor may suggest further testing and follow-up. \n \nYou will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with Bortezomib SUN, to \ncheck your blood cell counts regularly. \n \nIf you have mantle cell lymphoma and are given the medicine rituximab with Bortezomib SUN you \nshould tell your doctor: \n- if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, patients \n\nwho have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be fatal. If you \nhave a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs of \nactive hepatitis B. \n\n \nYou must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with \nBortezomib SUN for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with \nBortezomib SUN. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention \nrequirements is needed (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nBortezomib SUN should not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how the \nmedicine will affect them. \n \nOther medicines and Bortezomib SUN \nPlease tell your doctor, or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active \nsubstances: \n- ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections \n- ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection \n- rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections \n- carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat epilepsy \n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), used for depression or other conditions \n- oral antidiabetics \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou should not use Bortezomib SUN if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary. \n \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nYou should not breast-feed while using Bortezomib SUN. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to \nrestart breast-feeding after finishing your treatment. \n \nThalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When Bortezomib SUN is given in combination \nwith thalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package \nleaflet for thalidomide). \n \nContraception \nBoth men and women receiving Bortezomib SUN must use effective contraception during and for up \nto 3 months after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nDriving and using machines \nBortezomib SUN might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate \ntools or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you should still be cautious. \n \n \n3. How to use Bortezomib SUN \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Bortezomib SUN according to your height and weight (body \nsurface area). The usual starting dose of Bortezomib SUN is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a \nweek. \nYour doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response \nto the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver \nproblems). \n \nProgressive multiple myeloma \n- When Bortezomib SUN is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of Bortezomib SUN \n\nintravenously or subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day \u2018rest period\u2019 \nwithout treatment. This 21-day period (3 weeks) corresponds to one treatment cycle. You might \nreceive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \nYou may also be given Bortezomib SUN together with the medicines pegylated liposomal \ndoxorubicin or dexamethasone: \n- When Bortezomib SUN is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will \n\nreceive Bortezomib SUN intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle. \nPegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the Bortezomib SUN 21-day \ntreatment cycle as an intravenous infusion after the Bortezomib SUN injection. \nYou might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n- When Bortezomib SUN is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive Bortezomib \nSUN intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle. Dexamethasone 20 mg is \ngiven orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, of the Bortezomib SUN 21-day treatment cycle. \nYou might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \nPreviously untreated multiple myeloma \nIf you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem \ncell transplantation you will receive Bortezomib SUN together with two other medicines; melphalan \nand prednisone. \nIn this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles \n(54 weeks). \n- In cycles 1 to 4, Bortezomib SUN is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 \n\nand 32. \n- In cycles 5 to 9, Bortezomib SUN is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nMelphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the \nfirst week of each cycle. \n \nIf you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell \ntransplantation you will receive Bortezomib SUN intravenously or subcutaneously together with the \nmedicines dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment: \n- When Bortezomib SUN is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive Bortezomib \n\nSUN intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle. Dexamethasone 40 mg is \ngiven orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Bortezomib SUN 21-day treatment cycle. \nYou will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks). \n\n- When Bortezomib SUN is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of \na treatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). \nDexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days-1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Bortezomib \nSUN 28-day treatment cycle. Thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the \nfirst cycle, and if tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may \nbe further increased to 200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards. \nYou might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks). \n\n \nPreviously untreated mantle cell lymphoma \nIf you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive Bortezomib SUN \nintravenously or subcutaneously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin and prednisone.  \nBortezomib SUN is given intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a \u2018rest \nperiod\u2019 without treatment. The duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). You might receive \nup to 8 cycles (24 weeks). \nThe following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each Bortezomib SUN 21-day treatment cycle \nas intravenous infusions: \nRituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. \nPrednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bortezomib SUN treatment \ncycle. \n \nHow Bortezomib SUN is given \nThis medicine is for intravenous or subcutaneous use. Bortezomib SUN will be administered by a \nhealth care professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines. \nBortezomib SUN powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare \nprofessional. The resulting solution is then either injected into a vein or under the skin. Injection into a \nvein is rapid, taking 3 to 5 seconds. Injection under the skin is in either the thighs or the abdomen. \n \nIf you are given too much Bortezomib SUN \nAs this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. \nIn the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Dissolution of the lyophilised \npowder is completed in less than 2 minutes. \n \nThe concentration of the resulting solution will be 1 mg/ml. The solution will be clear and \ncolourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution. \n\n \n1.2 Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. If \n\nany discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution should be discarded. Be sure \nthat the correct dose is being given for the intravenous route of administration (1 mg/ml). \n\n \n1.3 The reconstituted solution is preservative free and should be used immediately after \n\npreparation. However, the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for \n8 hours at 25\u00b0C stored in the original vial and/or a syringe. The total storage time for the \nreconstituted medicinal product should not exceed 8 hours prior to administration. If the \nreconstituted solution is not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user. \n\n \nIt is not necessary to protect the reconstituted medicinal product from light. \n \n \n2. ADMINISTRATION \n \n- Once dissolved, withdraw the appropriate amount of the reconstituted solution according to \n\ncalculated dose based upon the patient\u00b4s Body Surface Area. \n- Confirm the dose and concentration in the syringe prior to use (check that the syringe is marked \n\nas intravenous administration). \n- Inject the solution as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection through a peripheral or central \n\nintravenous catheter into a vein. \n- Flush the peripheral or intravenous catheter with sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride \n\nsolution. \n \nBortezomib SUN 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection IS FOR SUBCUTANEOUS OR \nINTRAVENOUS USE. Do not give by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in \ndeath. \n \n \n3.

Of those, 121 cases reported chalazion, blepharitis, \nmeibomianitis, and/or Meibomian gland dysfunction. A biological plausibility supports the \nassociation between bortezomib and chalazion/blepharitis; theoretically, bortezomib-related \nmyelosuppression may facilitate viral infections such as herpes zoster thereby promoting chalazia. \nBased on this review, chalazion/blepharitis is considered associated with the use of bortezomib. \n \nIn addition, following a search of the worldwide medical and scientific literature carried out for the \nperiod covered by this PSUSA and a number of papers reporting safety information, 35 cases of \nThrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) were retrieved. Overall, the literature results are suggestive of a \npossible causal association between bortezomib (and other proteasome inhibitors) and TMA. \n \nBased on the data presented, the PRAC was of the view that the product information should be varied \nto update Section 4.8 the SmPC and relevant section of the package leaflet to add the following: \nchalazion, blepharitis and Thrombotic Microangiopathy. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for bortezomib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bortezomib is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
