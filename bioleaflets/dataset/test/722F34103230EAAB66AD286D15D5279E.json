This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe.\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 100 mg of guselkumab in 1 mL solution.\n\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\nEach pre-filled pen contains 100 mg of guselkumab in 1 mL solution.\n\nGuselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lamda (IgG1\u03bb) monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the\ninterleukin (IL)-23 protein, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection)\n\nThe solution is clear and colourless to light yellow.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTremfya is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTremfya is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of plaque psoriasis.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of Tremfya is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed \nby a maintenance dose every 8 weeks.\n\nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 16 weeks of treatment.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).\nThere is limited information in subjects aged \u2265 65 years.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nTremfya has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.\nFor further information on elimination of guselkumab, see section 5.2.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Tremfya in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nSubcutaneous use. If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection \nsites.\n\nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may inject Tremfya if a physician \ndetermines that this is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate medical \nfollow-up of patients. Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of Tremfya according to \nthe \u2018Instructions for use\u2019 provided in the carton.\nFor further instructions on preparation and special precautions for handling, see section 6.6 and the \n\u2018Instructions for use\u2019 leaflet.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nSerious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nClinically important active infections (e.g., active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfections\nTremfya may increase the risk of infection. Treatment with Tremfya should not be initiated in patients \nwith any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.\n\nPatients treated with Tremfya should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of \nclinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or \nserious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, the patient should be monitored closely and \nTremfya should be discontinued until the infection resolves.\n\nPre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis\nPrior to initiating treatment with Tremfya, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection.\nPatients receiving Tremfya should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after \ntreatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating Tremfya in patients with a past \nhistory of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.\n\nHypersensitivity\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in the post-marketing setting. Some cases \noccurred several days after treatment with guselkumab, including cases with urticaria and dyspnoea. If \na serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Tremfya should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated.\n\nImmunisations\nPrior to initiating therapy with Tremfya, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be \nconsidered according to current immunisation guidelines. Live vaccines should not be used \n\n\n\n4\n\nconcurrently in patients treated with Tremfya. No data are available on the response to live or inactive \nvaccines.\n\nBefore live viral or live bacterial vaccination, treatment with Tremfya should be withheld for at least \n12 weeks after the last dose and can be resumed at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Prescribers should \nconsult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the specific vaccine for additional information and \nguidance on concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents post-vaccination.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteractions with CYP450 substrates\nIn a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, changes in systemic exposures \n(Cmax and AUCinf) of midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and caffeine after a \nsingle dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant, indicating that drug interactions between \nguselkumab and substrates of various CYP enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and \nCYP1A2) are unlikely. There is no need for dose adjustment when co-administering guselkumab and \nCYP450 substrates.\n\nConcomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of Tremfya in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, or \nphototherapy have not been evaluated.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and \nfor at least 12 weeks after treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of guselkumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the \nuse of Tremfya in pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether guselkumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted \nin breast milk during the first few days after birth, and decrease to low concentrations soon afterwards; \nconsequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant during this period cannot be excluded. A decision should \nbe made whether to discontinue, or abstain from initiating treatment with Tremfya, taking into account \nthe benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Tremfya therapy to the woman. See \nsection 5.3 for information on the excretion of guselkumab in animal (cynomolgus monkey) milk.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of guselkumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTremfya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) was upper respiratory infection.\n\n\n\n5\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 1 provides a list of adverse reactions from psoriasis clinical studies as well as from \npost-marketing experience. The adverse reactions are classified by MedDRA System Organ Class and \nfrequency, using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: List of adverse reactions\nSystem Organ Class Frequency ADR\nInfections and infestations Very common Upper respiratory infections\n\nCommon Gastroenteritis\nCommon Herpes simplex infections\nCommon Tinea infections\n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Diarrhoea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common Urticaria\n\nUncommon Rash\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders\n\nCommon Arthralgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nCommon Injection site erythema\nUncommon Injection site pain\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nGastroenteritis\nIn two phase III clinical studies through the placebo-controlled period, gastroenteritis occurred more \nfrequently in the Tremfya-treated group (1.1%) than in the placebo group (0.7%). Through Week 156,\n4.9% of all Tremfya-treated patients reported gastroenteritis. Adverse reactions of gastroenteritis were \nnon-serious and did not lead to discontinuation of Tremfya through Week 156.\n\nInjection site reactions\nIn two phase III clinical studies through Week 48, 0.7% of Tremfya injections and 0.3% of placebo \ninjections were associated with injection site reactions. Through Week 156, 0.5% of Tremfya \ninjections were associated with injection site reactions. Adverse reactions of injection site erythema \nand injection site pain were generally mild to moderate in severity; none were serious, and none led to \ndiscontinuation of Tremfya.\n\nImmunogenicity\nThe immunogenicity of Tremfya was evaluated using a sensitive and drug-tolerant immunoassay. In \npooled phase II and phase III analyses, fewer than 6% of patients treated with Tremfya developed \nantidrug antibodies in up to 52 weeks of treatment. Of the patients who developed antidrug antibodies, \napproximately 7% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing, which equates to 0.4% of all \npatients treated with Tremfya. In pooled phase III analyses, approximately 9% of patients treated with \nTremfya developed antidrug antibodies in up to 156 weeks of treatment. Antidrug antibodies were not \nassociated with lower efficacy or development of injection-site reactions.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSingle intravenous doses of guselkumab up to 987 mg (10 mg/kg) have been administered in healthy \nvolunteers and single subcutaneous doses of guselkumab up to 300 mg have been administered in \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6\n\npatients with plaque psoriasis in clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of \noverdosage, monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and administer \nappropriate symptomatic treatment immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC16.\n\nMechanism of action\nGuselkumab is a human IgG1\u03bb monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds selectively to the interleukin 23 \n(IL-23) protein with high specificity and affinity. IL-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the \ndifferentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, (e.g., Th17 cells and Tc17 cells) and innate \nimmune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and \nIL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. In humans, selective blockade of IL-23 was shown to \nnormalize production of these cytokines.\n\nLevels of IL-23 are elevated in the skin of patients with plaque psoriasis. In in vitro models, \nguselkumab was shown to inhibit the bioactivity of IL-23 by blocking its interaction with cell surface \nIL-23 receptor, disrupting IL-23-mediated signaling, activation and cytokine cascades. Guselkumab \nexerts clinical effects in plaque psoriasis through blockade of the IL-23 cytokine pathway.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn a phase I study, treatment with guselkumab resulted in reduced expression of IL-23/Th17 pathway \ngenes and psoriasis-associated gene expression profiles, as shown by analyses of mRNA obtained \nfrom lesional skin biopsies of patients with plaque psoriasis at Week 12 compared to baseline. In the \nsame phase I study, treatment with guselkumab resulted in improvement of histological measures of \npsoriasis at Week 12, including reductions in epidermal thickness and T-cell density. In addition, \nreduced serum IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 levels compared to placebo were observed in guselkumab\ntreated patients in phase II and phase III studies. These results are consistent with the clinical benefit \nobserved with guselkumab treatment in plaque psoriasis.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy and safety of guselkumab was assessed in three randomised, double-blind, active \ncontrolled phase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who were \ncandidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.\n\nVOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2\nTwo studies (VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab versus \nplacebo and adalimumab in 1829 adult patients. Patients randomised to guselkumab (N=825) received \n100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter through Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) and \nWeek 20 (VOYAGE 2). Patients randomised to adalimumab (N=582) received 80 mg at Week 0 and \n40 mg at Week 1, followed by 40 mg every other week (q2w) through Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) and \nWeek 23 (VOYAGE 2). In both studies, patients randomised to placebo (N=422) received guselkumab \n100 mg at Weeks 16, 20 and q8w thereafter. In VOYAGE 1, all patients, including those randomised \nto adalimumab at Week 0, started to receive open-label guselkumab q8w at Week 52. In VOYAGE 2, \npatients randomised to guselkumab at Week 0 who were Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 \nresponders at Week 28 were re-randomised to either continue treatment with guselkumab q8w \n(maintenance treatment) or receive placebo (withdrawal treatment). Withdrawal patients re-initiated \nguselkumab (dosed at time of retreatment, 4 weeks later and q8w thereafter) when they experienced at \nleast a 50% loss of their Week 28 PASI improvement. Patients randomised to adalimumab at Week 0 \nwho were PASI 90 non-responders received guselkumab at Weeks 28, 32 and q8w thereafter. In \nVOYAGE 2, all patients started to receive open-label guselkumab q8w at Week 76.\n\n\n\n7\n\nBaseline disease characteristics were consistent for the study populations in VOYAGE 1 and 2 with a \nmedian body surface area (BSA) of 22% and 24%, a median baseline PASI score of 19 for both \nstudies, a median baseline dermatology quality of life index (DLQI) score of 14 and 14.5, a baseline \ninvestigator global assessment (IGA) score of severe for 25% and 23% of patients, and a history of \npsoriatic arthritis for 19% and 18% of patients, respectively.\n\nOf all patients included in VOYAGE 1 and 2, 32% and 29% were na\u00efve to both conventional systemic\nand biologic therapy, 54% and 57% had received prior phototherapy, and 62% and 64% had received \nprior conventional systemic therapy, respectively. In both studies, 21% had received prior biologic \ntherapy, including 11% who had received at least one anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) agent, \nand approximately 10% who had received an anti-IL-12/IL-23 agent.\n\nThe efficacy of guselkumab was evaluated with respect to overall skin disease, regional disease (scalp, \nhand and foot and nails) and quality of life and patient reported outcomes. The co-primary endpoints \nin VOYAGE 1 and 2 were the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of cleared or \nminimal (IGA 0/1) and a PASI 90 response at Week 16 versus placebo (see Table 2).\n\nOverall skin disease\nTreatment with guselkumab resulted in significant improvements in the measures of disease activity \ncompared to placebo and adalimumab at Week 16 and compared to adalimumab at Weeks 24 and 48. \nThe key efficacy results for the primary and major secondary study endpoints are shown in Table 2\nbelow.\n\nTable 2: Summary of Clinical Responses in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2\nNumber of patients (%)\n\nVOYAGE 1 VOYAGE 2\nPlacebo\n(N=174)\n\nGuselkumab\n(N=329)\n\nAdalimumab\n(N=334)\n\nPlacebo\n(N=248)\n\nGuselkumab\n(N=496)\n\nAdalimumab\n(N=248)\n\nWeek 16\nPASI 75 10 (5.7) 300 (91.2)a 244 (73.1)b 20 (8.1) 428 (86.3)a 170 (68.5)b\n\nPASI 90 5 (2.9) 241 (73.3)c 166 (49.7)b 6 (2.4) 347 (70.0)c 116 (46.8)b\n\nPASI 100 1 (0.6) 123 (37.4)a 57 (17.1)d 2 (0.8) 169 (34.1)a 51 (20.6)d\n\nIGA 0/1 12 (6.9) 280 (85.1)c 220 (65.9)b 21 (8.5) 417 (84.1)c 168 (67.7)b\n\nIGA 0 2 (1.1) 157 (47.7)a 88 (26.3)d 2 (0.8) 215 (43.3)a 71 (28.6)d\n\nWeek 24\nPASI 75 - 300 (91.2) 241 (72.2)e - 442 (89.1) 176 (71.0)e\n\nPASI 90 - 264 (80.2) 177 (53.0)b - 373 (75.2) 136 (54.8)b\n\nPASI 100 - 146 (44.4) 83 (24.9)e - 219 (44.2) 66 (26.6)e\n\nIGA 0/1 - 277 (84.2) 206 (61.7)b - 414 (83.5) 161 (64.9)b\n\nIGA 0 - 173 (52.6) 98 (29.3)b - 257 (51.8) 78 (31.5)b\n\nWeek 48\nPASI 75 - 289 (87.8) 209 (62.6)e - - -\nPASI 90 - 251 (76.3) 160 (47.9)b - - -\nPASI 100 - 156 (47.4) 78 (23.4)e - - -\nIGA 0/1 - 265 (80.5) 185 (55.4)b - - -\nIGA 0 - 166 (50.5) 86 (25.7)b - - -\n\na\np < 0.001 for comparison between guselkumab and placebo.\n\nb\np < 0.001 for comparison between guselkumab and adalimumab for major secondary endpoints.\n\nc\np < 0.001 for the comparisons between guselkumab and placebo for the co-primary endpoints.\n\nd\ncomparisons between guselkumab and adalimumab were not performed.\n\ne\np < 0.001 for comparison between guselkumab and adalimumab.\n\nResponse over time\nGuselkumab demonstrated rapid onset of efficacy, with a significantly higher percent improvement in \nPASI as compared with placebo as early as Week 2 (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients achieving a \nPASI 90 response was numerically higher for guselkumab than adalimumab starting at Week 8 with \nthe difference reaching a maximum around Week 20 (VOYAGE 1 and 2) and maintained through \nWeek 48 (VOYAGE 1) (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n8\n\nFigure 1: Percent of Subjects Who Achieved a PASI 90 Response Through Week 48 by Visit \n(Subjects Randomised at Week 0) in VOYAGE 1\n\nWeek\n\nP\ne\nrc\n\ne\nn\n\nt \no\n\nf \nS\n\nu\nb\n\nje\nc\nts\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nPlacebo\n(n=174)\n\nGuselkumab\n(n=329)\n\nAdalimumab\n(n=334)\n\n1\n16\n\n8\n_v\n\n2\n\nIn VOYAGE 1, for patients receiving continuous guselkumab treatment, the PASI 90 response rate\nwas maintained from Week 52 through Week 156. For patients randomised to adalimumab at Week 0\nwho crossed over to guselkumab at Week 52, the PASI 90 response rate increased from Week 52 \nthrough Week 76 and was then maintained through Week 156 (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Percent of Subjects Who Achieved a PASI 90 Response by Visit in the Open-Label \nPhase in VOYAGE 1\n\nThe efficacy and safety of guselkumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, body weight, \nplaques location, PASI baseline severity, concurrent psoriatic arthritis, and previous treatment with a \nbiologic therapy. Guselkumab was efficacious in conventional systemic-naive, biologic-naive, and \nbiologic-exposed patients.\n\n\n\n9\n\nIn VOYAGE 2, 88.6% of patients receiving guselkumab maintenance treatment at Week 48 were \nPASI 90 responders compared to 36.8% of patients who were withdrawn from treatment at Week 28\n(p < 0.001). Loss of PASI 90 response was noted as early as 4 weeks after withdrawal of guselkumab\ntreatment with a median time to loss of PASI 90 response of approximately 15 weeks. Among patients \nwho were withdrawn from treatment and subsequently re-initiated guselkumab, 80% regained a \nPASI 90 response when assessed 20 weeks after initiation of retreatment.\n\nIn VOYAGE 2, among 112 patients randomised to adalimumab who failed to achieve a PASI 90 \nresponse at Week 28, 66% and 76% achieved a PASI 90 response after 20 and 44 weeks of treatment \nwith guselkumab, respectively. In addition, among 95 patients randomised to guselkumab who failed \nto achieve a PASI 90 response at Week 28, 36% and 41% achieved a PASI 90 response with an \nadditional 20 and 44 weeks of continued treatment with guselkumab, respectively.

All patients (N=871) received open-label ustekinumab (45 mg \u2264100 kg and \n90 mg >100 kg) at Weeks 0 and 4. At Week 16, 268 patients with an IGA \u2265 2 score were randomised\nto either continue ustekinumab treatment (N=133) q12w, or to initiate guselkumab treatment (N=135) \nat Weeks 16, 20, and q8w thereafter. Baseline characteristics for randomised patients were similar to \nthose observed in VOYAGE 1 and 2.\n\nAfter randomisation, the primary endpoint was the number of post-randomisation visits between \nWeeks 12 and 24 at which patients achieved an IGA score 0/1 and had \u2265 2 grade improvement.\nPatients were examined at four week intervals for a total of four visits. Among patients who\ninadequately responded to ustekinumab at the time of randomisation, significantly greater\nimprovement of efficacy was observed in patients who switched to guselkumab treatment compared to \npatients who continued ustekinumab treatment. Between 12 and 24 weeks after randomisation,\nguselkumab patients achieved an IGA score 0/1 with \u2265 2 grade improvement twice as often as \nustekinumab patients (mean 1.5 vs 0.7 visits, respectively, p < 0.001). Additionally, at 12 weeks after \nrandomisation a higher proportion of guselkumab patients compared to ustekinumab patients achieved \nan IGA score 0/1 and \u2265 2 grade improvement (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively; p = 0.001) and a \n\n\n\n11\n\nPASI 90 response (48% vs 23%, respectively, p < 0.001). Differences in response rates between \nguselkumab and ustekinumab treated patients were noted as early as 4 weeks after randomisation \n(11.1% and 9.0%, respectively) and reached a maximum 24 weeks after randomisation (see Figure 3).\nNo new safety findings were observed in patients who switched from ustekinumab to guselkumab.\n\nFigure 3: Percent of Subjects Who Achieved an IGA Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) and \nat least a 2-grade improvement in IGA from Week 0 Through Week 24 by Visit \nAfter Randomisation in NAVIGATE\n\nP\ne\n\nrc\ne\n\nn\nt \n\no\nf \n\nS\nu\n\nb\nje\n\nc\nts\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nWeek After Randomisation\n\nGuselkumab (n=135) Ustekinumab (n=133)\n\n1\n16\n\n9_\nv5\n\nECLIPSE\nEfficacy and safety of guselkumab were also investigated in a double-blind study compared to\nsecukinumab. Patients were randomised to receive guselkumab (N=534; 100 mg at Week 0, 4 and q8w \nthereafter), or secukinumab (N=514; 300 mg at Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and q4w thereafter). The last dose \nwas at week 44 for both treatment groups.\n\nBaseline disease characteristics were consistent with a population of moderate to severe plaque \npsoriasis with a median BSA of 20%, a median PASI score of 18, and an IGA score of severe for 24% \nof patients.\n\nGuselkumab was superior to secukinumab as measured by the primary endpoint of PASI 90 response \nat Week 48 (84.5% versus 70.0%, p < 0.001).

The mean \n(\u00b1 SD) steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations in two phase III studies were \n1.15 \u00b1 0.73 mcg/mL and 1.23 \u00b1 0.84 mcg/mL.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of guselkumab following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection was \nestimated to be approximately 49% in healthy subjects.\n\nDistribution\nMean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following a single intravenous \nadministration to healthy subjects ranged from approximately 7 to 10 L across studies.\n\n\n\n13\n\nBiotransformation\nThe exact pathway through which guselkumab is metabolized has not been characterized. As a human \nIgG mAb, guselkumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic\npathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.\n\nElimination\nMean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to healthy subjects\nranged from 0.288 to 0.479 L/day across studies. Mean half-life (T1/2) of guselkumab was \napproximately 17 days in healthy subjects and approximately 15 to 18 days in patients with plaque \npsoriasis across studies.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe systemic exposure of guselkumab (Cmax and AUC) increased in an approximately \ndose-proportional manner following a single subcutaneous injection at doses ranging from 10 mg to \n300 mg in healthy subjects or patients with plaque psoriasis.\n\nElderly patients\nNo specific studies have been conducted in elderly patients. Of the 1384 plaque psoriasis patients \nexposed to guselkumab and included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 70 patients were \n65 years of age or older, including 4 patients who were 75 years of age or older. Population \npharmacokinetic analyses indicated there were no apparent changes in CL/F estimate in patients \n\u2265 65 years of age compared to patients < 65 years of age, suggesting no dose adjustment is needed for \nelderly patients.\n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment\nNo specific study has been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of guselkumab. Renal elimination of intact guselkumab, an IgG mAb, is expected to\nbe low and of minor importance; similarly, hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance \nof guselkumab as IgG mAbs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety\npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and pre- and post-natal development.\n\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, guselkumab was well tolerated via\nintravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration. A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to \nmonkeys resulted in exposure (AUC) and Cmax values that were at least 49-fold and >200-fold higher, \nrespectively, than those measured in the human clinical PK study. Additionally, there were no adverse \nimmunotoxicity or cardiovascular safety pharmacology effects noted during the conduct of the \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies or in a targeted cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus \nmonkeys.\n\nThere were no preneoplastic changes observed in histopathology evaluations of animals treated up to \n24-weeks, or following the 12-week recovery period during which drug was detectable in the serum.\n\nNo mutagenicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted with guselkumab.\n\nGuselkumab could not be detected in breast milk from cynomolgus monkeys as measured at post-natal \nday 28.\n\n6.
