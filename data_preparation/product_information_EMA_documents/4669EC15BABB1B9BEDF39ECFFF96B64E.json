CHARACTERISTICS \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCabazitaxel Accord 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of concentrate contains 20 mg cabazitaxel. \nEach vial of 3 ml of concentrate contains 60 mg cabazitaxel. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nThe finished product contains 395 mg/ml of ethanol anhydrous, thus each 3 ml vial contains 1,185 mg \nethanol anhydrous. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \nThe concentrate is a clear colourless to pale yellow or brownish yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCabazitaxel Accord in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously treated with a \ndocetaxel-containing regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of cabazitaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxics and it \nshould only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of anticancer \nchemotherapy. Facilities and equipment for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions like \nhypotension and bronchospasm must be available (see section 4.4). \n \nPremedication \nThe recommended premedication regimen should be performed at least 30 minutes prior to each \nadministration of cabazitaxel with the following intravenous medicinal products to mitigate the risk and \nseverity of hypersensitivity: \n• antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg or diphenhydramine 25 mg or equivalent), \n• corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent), and \n• H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent) (see section 4.4). \n \nAntiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously as needed.  \n \nThroughout the treatment, adequate hydration of the patient needs to be ensured, in order to prevent \ncomplications like renal failure. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of cabazitaxel is 25 mg/m2 administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every \n3 weeks in combination with oral prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg administered daily throughout \ntreatment. \n \nDose adjustments \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nDose modifications should be made if patients experience the following adverse reactions (Grades refer \nto Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE 4.0]): \n \nTable 1 - Recommended dose modifications for adverse reaction in patients treated with cabazitaxel \n \n\nAdverse reactions Dose modification \nProlonged grade ≥3 neutropenia (longer than \n1 week) despite appropriate treatment including \nG-CSF \n\nDelay treatment until neutrophil count is \n>1,500 cells/mm3, then reduce cabazitaxel dose \nfrom 25 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2. \n\nFebrile neutropenia or neutropenic infection Delay treatment until improvement or resolution, \nand until neutrophil count is >1,500 cells/mm3, \nthen reduce cabazitaxel dose from 25 mg/m2 to \n20 mg/m2. \n\nGrade ≥3 diarrhoea or persisting diarrhea despite \nappropriate treatment, including fluid and \nelectrolytes replacement \n\nDelay treatment until improvement or resolution, \nthen reduce cabazitaxel dose from 25 mg/m2 to \n20 mg/m2. \n\nGrade >2 peripheral neuropathy Delay treatment until improvement, then reduce \ncabazitaxel dose from 25 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2. \n\n \nIf patients continue to experience any of these reactions at 20 mg/m2, further dose reduction to \n15 mg/m2 or discontinuation of cabazitaxel may be considered. Data in patients below the 20 mg/m2 \ndose are limited. \n \nConcomitant medicinal products use \nConcomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers or strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be \navoided. However, if patients require co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, a 25% cabazitaxel \ndose reduction should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nCabazitaxel is extensively metabolised by the liver. Patients with mild hepatic impairment (total \nbilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) \n>1.5 x ULN), should have cabazitaxel dose reduced to 20 mg/m2. Administration of cabazitaxel to \npatients with mild hepatic impairment should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring of \nsafety. \nCabazitaxel Accord must not be given to patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (total \nbilirubin > 1.5 x ULN) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nCabazitaxel is minimally excreted through the kidney. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with \nrenal impairment, not requiring hemodialysis. Patients presenting end stage renal disease (creatinine \nclearance (CLCR< 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), by their condition and the limited amount of data available \nshould be treated with caution and monitored carefully during treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nElderly \nNo specific dose adjustment for the use of cabazitaxel in elderly patients is recommended (see also \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of cabazitaxel in the paediatric population. \nThe safety and the efficacy of cabazitaxel in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not \nbeen established (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \nCabazitaxel Accord is for intravenous use. \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nPVC infusion containers and polyurethane infusion sets should not be used. \nCabazitaxel must not be mixed with any other medicinal products than those mentioned in section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to cabazitaxel, to other taxanes, or polysorbate 80 or any excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n• Neutrophil counts less than 1,500/mm3. \n• Moderate and severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN). \n• Concomitant vaccination with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nAll patients should be pre-medicated prior to the initiation of the infusion of cabazitaxel (see section \n4.2). \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and second \ninfusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the \ninfusion of cabazitaxel, thus facilities and equipment for the treatment of hypotension and \nbronchospasm should be available. Severe reactions can occur and may include generalized \nrash/erythema, hypotension and bronchospasm. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate \ndiscontinuation of cabazitaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients with a hypersensitivity reaction must \nstop treatment with cabazitaxel (see section 4.3). \n \nBone marrow suppression \nBone marrow suppression manifested as neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia may \noccur (see “Risk of neutropenia” and “Anaemia” in section 4.4 below). \n \nRisk of neutropenia \nPatients treated with cabazitaxel may receive prophylactic G-CSF, as per American Society of Clinical \nOncology (ASCO) guidelines and/or current institutional guidelines, to reduce the risk or manage \nneutropenia complications (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPrimary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features \n(age >65 years, poor performance status, previous episodes of febrile neutropenia, extensive prior \nradiation ports, poor nutritional status, or other serious comorbidities) that predispose them to increased \ncomplications from prolonged neutropenia. The use of G-CSF has been shown to limit the incidence \nand severity of neutropenia. \nNeutropenia is the most common adverse reaction of cabazitaxel (see section 4.8). Monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts is essential on a weekly basis during cycle 1 and before each treatment cycle \nthereafter so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed.  \nThe dose should be reduced in case of febrile neutropenia, or prolonged neutropenia despite appropriate \ntreatment (see section 4.2). \nPatients should be re-treated only when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500/mm3 (see section 4.3). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nSymptoms such as abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, persistent constipation, diarrhoea, with or \nwithout neutropenia, may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be \nevaluated and treated promptly. Cabazitaxel treatment delay or discontinuation may be necessary. \n \nRisk of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration \nIf patients experience diarrhoea following administration of cabazitaxel they may be treated with \ncommonly used anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Appropriate measures should be taken to re-hydrate \npatients. Diarrhoea can occur more frequently in patients that have received prior abdomino-pelvic \nradiation. Dehydration is more common in patients aged 65 or older. Appropriate measures should be \ntaken to rehydrate patients and to monitor and correct serum electrolyte levels, particularly potassium. \nTreatment delay or dose reduction may be necessary for grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea (see section 4.2). If \npatients experience nausea or vomiting, they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \nRisk of serious gastrointestinal reactions \nGastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage and perforation, ileus, colitis, including fatal outcome, have been \nreported in patients treated with cabazitaxel (see section 4.8). Caution is advised with treatment of \npatients most at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications: those with neutropenia, the elderly, \nconcomitant use of NSAIDs, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulants, and patients with a prior history of \npelvic radiotherapy or gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and GI bleeding. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nCases of peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy (e.g., paraesthesias, dysaesthesias) and \nperipheral motor neuropathy have been observed in patients receiving cabazitaxel. Patients under \ntreatment with cabazitaxel should be advised to inform their doctor prior to continuing treatment if \nsymptoms of neuropathy such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness, or weakness develop. Physicians \nshould assess for the presence or worsening of neuropathy before each treatment. Treatment should be \ndelayed until improvement of symptoms. The dose of cabazitaxel should be reduced from 25 mg/m2 to \n20 mg/m2 for persistent grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy (see section 4.2). \n \nAnaemia \nAnaemia has been observed in patients receiving cabazitaxel (see section 4.8). Haemoglobin and \nhaematocrit should be checked before treatment with cabazitaxel and if patients exhibit signs or \nsymptoms of anaemia or blood loss. Caution is recommended in patients with haemoglobin <10 g/dl \nand appropriate measures should be taken as clinically indicated. \n \nRisk of renal failure \nRenal disorders, have been reported in association with sepsis, severe dehydration due to diarrhoea, \nvomiting and obstructive uropathy. Renal failure including cases with fatal outcome has been observed. \nAppropriate measures should be taken to identify the cause and intensively treat the patients if this \noccurs. \nAdequate hydration should be ensured throughout treatment with cabazitaxel. The patient should be \nadvised to report any significant change in daily urinary volume immediately. Serum creatinine should \nbe measured at baseline, with each blood count and whenever the patient reports a change in urinary \noutput. Cabazitaxel treatment should be discontinued in case of any degradation of renal function to \nrenal failure ≥ CTCAE 4.0 Grade 3. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nInterstitial  pneumonia/pneumonitis  and  interstitial  lung  disease  have  been  reported  and  may  be \nassociated with fatal outcome (see section 4.8). \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of cabazitaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The \nbenefit of resuming cabazitaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nRisk of cardiac arrhythmias \nCardiac arrhythmias have been reported, most commonly tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (see section \n4.8). \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions \nincluding neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with liver impairment \nTreatment with Cabazitaxel Accord is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN) (See sections 4.3 and 5.2). \nDose should be reduced for patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST >1.5 x ULN), \nhepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nInteractions \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nCo-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided since they may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of cabazitaxel (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). If co-administration with a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor cannot be avoided, close monitoring for toxicity and a cabazitaxel dose reduction should be \nconsidered (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \nCo-administration with strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided since they may decrease plasma \nconcentrations of cabazitaxel (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nExcipients \nThe finished product contains 395 mg/ml ethanol anhydrous, thus each 3 ml vial contains 1,185 mg \nethanol anhydrous, which is equivalent to 16.33 Vol %. The amount in dose of this medicinal product is \nequivalent to 30 ml beer or 12 ml wine.  \n \nA dose of 60 mg of this medicinal product administered to an adult weighing 70 kg would result in an \nexposure to 17mg/kg of ethanol which may cause a rise in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of about \n2,8 mg/100 ml. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that cabazitaxel is mainly metabolised through CYP3A (80% to 90%) (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \nRepeated administration of ketoconazole (400 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in a \n20% decrease in cabazitaxel clearance corresponding to a 25% increase in AUC. Therefore concomitant \nadministration of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, \nnefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) should be avoided as an \nincrease of plasma concentrations of cabazitaxel may occur (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nConcomitant administration of aprepitant, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, had no effect on cabazitaxel \nclearance. \n \nCYP3A inducers \nRepeated administration of rifampin (600 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in an \nincrease in cabazitaxel clearance of 21% corresponding to a decrease in AUC of 17%. \nTherefore concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nrifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital) should be avoided as a decrease of plasma concentrations \nof cabazitaxel may occur (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). In addition, patients should also refrain from taking \nSt. John’s Wort. \n \nOATP1B1 \nIn vitro, cabazitaxel has also been shown to inhibit the transport proteins of the Organic Anion \nTransport Polypeptides OATP1B1. The risk of interaction with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. statins, \nvalsartan, repaglinide) is possible, notably during the infusion duration (1 hour) and up to 20 minutes \nafter the end of the infusion. A time interval of 12 hours is recommended before the infusion and at \nleast 3 hours after the end of infusion before administering the OATP1B1 substrates. \n \nVaccinations \nAdministration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by \nchemotherapeutic agents may result in serious or fatal infections. Vaccination with a live attenuated \nvaccine should be avoided in patients receiving cabazitaxel. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be \nadministered; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of cabazitaxel in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3) and that cabazitaxel crosses the placenta \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nbarrier (see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, cabazitaxel may cause foetal harm \nin exposed pregnant women. \nCabazitaxel is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreastfeeding \nAvailable pharmacokinetics data in animals have shown excretion of cabazitaxel and its metabolites in \nmilk (see section 5.3). A risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. \nCabazitaxel should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies showed that cabazitaxel affected reproductive system in male rats and dogs without any \nfunctional effect on fertility (see section 5.3). Nevertheless, considering the pharmacological activity of \ntaxanes, their genotoxic potential and effect of several compounds of this class on fertility in animal \nstudies, effect on male fertility could not be excluded in human. \n \nDue to potential effects on male gametes and to potential exposure via seminal liquid, men treated with \ncabazitaxel should use effective contraception throughout treatment and are recommended to continue \nthis for up to 6 months after the last dose of cabazitaxel. Due to potential exposure via seminal liquid, \nmen treated with cabazitaxel should prevent contact with the ejaculate by another person throughout \ntreatment. Men being treated with cabazitaxel are advised to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior \nto treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCabazitaxel has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines as it may cause fatigue and \ndizziness. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these adverse \nreactions during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nThe safety of cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone was evaluated in 371 patients \nwith metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who were treated with 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel once \nevery three weeks in a randomised open label, controlled phase III study. Patients received a median \nduration of 6 cycles of cabazitaxel. \n \nThe most commonly (≥10%) occurring adverse reactions in all grades were anaemia (97.3%), \nleukopenia (95.7%), neutropenia (93.5%), thrombocytopenia (47.4%), and diarrhoea (46.6%). The most \ncommonly (≥5%) occurring grade ≥3 adverse reactions in the cabazitaxel group were neutropenia \n(81.7%), leukopenia (68.2%), anaemia (10.5%), febrile neutropenia (7.5%), diarrhoea (6.2%). \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 68 patients (18.3%) receiving \ncabazitaxel.

The incidence of grade ≥3 \nclinical neutropenia and febrile neutropenia adverse reactions were 21.3% and 7.5% respectively. \nNeutropenia was the most common adverse reaction leading to medicinal product discontinuation \n(2.4%). \nNeutropenic complications included neutropenic infections (0.5%), neutropenic sepsis (0.8%), and \nseptic shock (1.1%), which in some cases resulted in a fatal outcome. \nThe use of G-CSF has been shown to limit the incidence and severity of neutropenia (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). \n \nCardiac disorders and arrhythmias \nAll Grade events among cardiac disorders were more common on cabazitaxel of which 6 patients \n(1.6%) had Grade ≥3 cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of tachycardia on cabazitaxel was 1.6%, none \nof which were Grade ≥3. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 1.1% in the cabazitaxel group. Cardiac \nfailure events were more common on cabazitaxel, the event term being reported for 2 patients (0.5%). \nOne patient in the cabazitaxel group died from cardiac failure. Fatal ventricular fibrillation was reported \nin 1 patient (0.3%), and cardiac arrest in 2 patients (0.5%). None were considered related by the \ninvestigator. \n \nHaematuria \nHaematuria all grades frequency was 20.8% at 25 mg/m2 in EFC11785 study (see section 5.1). \nConfounding causes such as disease progression, instrumentation, infection or \nanticoagulation/NSAID/aspirin therapy were identified in nearly two thirds of the cases. \n \nOther laboratory abnormalities \nThe incidence of grade ≥3 anaemia, increased AST, ALT, and bilirubin based on laboratory \nabnormalities were 10.5%, 0.7%, 0.9%, and 0.6%, respectively. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nColitis, enterocolitis, gastritis, neutropenic enterocolitis have been observed. Gastrointestinal \nhemorrhage and perforation, ileus and intestinal obstruction have also been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nRespiratory disorders \nCases of interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease, sometimes fatal have been \nreported with an unknown frequency (cannot be estimated from the available data) (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCystitis due to radiation recall phenomenon, including haemorrhagic cystitis, were reported \nuncommonly. \n \nPaediatric population  \nSee section 4.2 \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nOther special populations \nElderly \nAmong the 371 patients treated with cabazitaxel in the prostate cancer study, 240 patients were 65 years \nor over including 70 patients older than 75 years. \nThe following adverse reactions reported at rates ≥5% higher in patients 65 years of age or greater \ncompared to younger patients were fatigue (40.4% versus 29.8%), clinical neutropenia (24.2% versus \n17.6%), asthenia (23.8% versus 14.5%), pyrexia (14.6% versus 7.6%), dizziness (10.0% versus 4.6%), \nurinary tract infection (9.6% versus 3.1%) and dehydration (6.7% versus 1.5%), respectively.  \nThe incidence of the following grade ≥3 adverse reactions were higher in patients ≥65 years of age \ncompared to younger patients; neutropenia based on laboratory abnormalities (86.3% versus 73.3%), \nclinical neutropenia (23.8% versus 16.8%) and febrile neutropenia (8.3% versus 6.1%) (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). \n \nOf the 595 patients treated with cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 in the prostate cancer EFC 11785 study, 420 \npatients were 65 years or over. The adverse reactions reported at rates of at least 5% higher in patients \n65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients were diarrhoea (42.9% vs. 32.6%), fatigue \n(30.2% vs. 19.4%), asthenia (22.4% vs. 13.1%), constipation (20.2% vs. 12.6%), clinical neutropenia \n(12.9% vs. 6.3%), febrile neutropenia (11.2% vs. 4.6%) and dyspnoea (9.5% vs. 3.4%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote to cabazitaxel. The anticipated complications of overdose would consist of \nexacerbation of adverse reactions as bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal disorders. \nIn case of overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and closely monitored. Patients \nshould receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. Other appropriate \nsymptomatic measures should be taken. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, taxanes, ATC code: L01CD04 \n \nMechanism of action \nCabazitaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells. \nCabazitaxel binds to tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into microtubules while \nsimultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the stabilisation of microtubules, which \nresults in the inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nCabazitaxel demonstrated a broad spectrum of antitumour activity against advanced human tumours \nxenografted in mice. Cabazitaxel is active in docetaxel-sensitive tumours. In addition, cabazitaxel \ndemonstrated activity in tumour models insensitive to chemotherapy including docetaxel. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone were evaluated \nin a randomised, open-label, international, multi-center, phase III study (EFC6193 study), in patients \nwith metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previsouly treated with a docetaxel containing \nregimen. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n \n\nOverall survival (OS) was the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. \nSecondary endpoints included Progression Free Survival [PFS (defined as time from randomization to \ntumour progression, Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) progression, pain progression, or death due to \nany cause, whichever occurred first], Tumour Response Rate based on Response Evaluation Criteria in \nSolid Tumours (RECIST), PSA Progression (defined as a ≥25% increase or >50% in PSA non-\nresponders or responders respectively), PSA response (declines in serum PSA levels of at least 50%), \npain progression [assessed using the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale from the McGill-Melzack \nquestionnaire and an Analgesic Score (AS)] and pain response (defined as 2-point greater reduction \nfrom baseline median PPI with no concomitant increase in AS, or reduction of ≥50% in analgesic use \nfrom baseline mean AS with no concomitant increase in pain). \n \nA total of 755 patients were randomised to receive either cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 intravenously every \n3 weeks for a maximum of 10 cycles with prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg orally daily (n=378), or to \nreceive mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 10 cycles with \nprednisone or prednisolone 10 mg orally daily (n=377). \n \nThis study included patients over 18 years of age with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer \neither measurable by RECIST criteria or non-measurable disease with rising PSA levels or appearance \nof new lesions, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. Patients \nhad to have neutrophils >1,500/mm3, platelets >100,000/mm3, haemoglobin >10 g/dl, \ncreatinine <1.5 x ULN, total bilirubin <1 x ULN, AST and ALT <1.5 x ULN. \n \nPatients with a history of congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within last 6 months, or \npatients with uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and/or hypertension were not included \nin the study. \n \nDemographics, including age, race, and ECOG performance status (0 to 2), were balanced between the \ntreatment arms. In the cabazitaxel group, the mean age was 68 years, range (46-92) and the racial \ndistribution was 83.9% Caucasian, 6.9% Asian/Oriental, 5.3% Black and 4% Others. \n \nThe median number of cycles was 6 in the cabazitaxel group and 4 in the mitoxantrone group. The \nnumber of patients who completed the study treatment (10 cycles) was respectively 29.4% and 13.5% in \nthe cabazitaxel group and in the comparator group. \n \nOverall survival was significant longer with cabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone (15.1 months versus \n12.7 respectively), with a 30% reduction in the risk of death compared to mitoxantrone (see table 3 and \nfigure 1). \n \nA sub-group of 59 patients received prior cumulative dose of docetaxel <225 mg/m2 (29 patients in \ncabazitaxel arm, 30 patients in mitoxantrone arm). There was no significant difference in overall \nsurvival in this group of patients (HR (95%CI) 0.96 (0.49-1.86)). \n \nTable 3 - Efficacy of cabazitaxel in EFC6193 study in the treatment of patients with metastatic \ncastration resistant prostate cancer \n Cabazitaxel+ prednisone \n\nn=378 \nmitoxantrone+ prednisone \n\nn=377 \nOverall survival   \nNumber of patients with deaths (%) 234 (61.9%) 279 (74%) \nMedian survival (months) (95% CI) 15.1 (14.1-16.3) 12.7 (11.6-13.7) \nHazard Ratio (HR)1 (95% CI) 0.70 (0.59-0.83) \np-value <0.0001 \n\n1HR estimated using Cox model; a hazard ratio of less than 1 favours cabazitaxel \n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier overall survival curves (EFC6193) \n\n \nThere was an improvement in PFS in the cabazitaxel arm compared to mitoxantrone arm, 2.8 (2.4-3.0) \nmonths versus 1.4 (1.4-1.7) respectively, HR (95%CI) 0.74 (0.64-0.86), p<0.0001. \n \nThere was a significant higher rate of tumour response of 14.4% (95%CI: 9.6-19.3) in patients in the \ncabazitaxel arm compared to 4.4% (95%CI: 1.6-7.2) for patients in the mitoxantrone arm, p=0.0005. \n \nPSA secondary endpoints were positive in the cabazitaxel arm. There was a median PSA progression of \n6.4 months (95%CI: 5.1-7.3) for patients in cabazitaxel arm, compared to 3.1 months (95%CI: 2.2-4.4) \nin the mitoxantrone arm, HR 0.75 months (95%CI: 0.63-0.90), p=0.0010. The PSA response was 39.2% \nin patients on cabazitaxel arm (95%CI: 33.9-44.5) versus 17.8% of patients on mitoxantrone (95%CI: \n13.7-22.0), p=0.0002. \n \nThere was no statistical difference between both treatment arms in pain progression and pain response. \n \nIn a non-inferiority, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open label phase III study (EFC11785 \nstudy), 1200 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, previously treated with a \ndocetaxel-containing regimen, were randomized to receive either cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 (n=602) or \n20 mg/m2 (n=598) dose. Overall survival (OS) was the primary efficacy end-point. \nThe study met its primary objective of demonstrating the non-inferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 in \ncomparison with 25 mg/m2 (see table 4). A statistically significantly higher percentage (p<0.001) of \npatients showed a PSA response in the 25 mg/m2 group (42.9%) compared to the 20 mg/m2 group \n(29.5%). A statistically significantly higher risk of PSA progression in patients with the 20 mg/m2 dose \nwith respect to the 25 mg/m2 dose was observed (HR 1.195 ; 95%CI: 1.025 to 1.393). There was no \nstatistically difference with regards to the other secondary endpoints (PFS, tumour and pain response, \ntumour and pain progression, and four subcategories of FACT-P). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nTable 4 - Overall survival in EFC11785 study in cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 arm versus cabazitaxel \n20 mg/m2 arm (Intent-to–treat analysis) – Efficacy primary endpoint \n \n CBZ20+PRED \n\nn=598 \nCBZ25+PRED \n\nn=602 \nOverall survival   \nNumber of deaths, n (%) 497 (83.1 %) 501 (83.2%) \nMedian survival (95% CI) (months) 13.4 (12.19 to 14.88) 14.5 (13.47 to 15.28) \nHazard Ratioa  \n\nversus CBZ25+PRED 1.024 - \n1-sided 98.89% UCI 1.184 - \n1-sided 95% LCI 0.922 - \n\nCBZ20=Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2, CBZ25=Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2, PRED=Prednisone/Prednisolone \nCI=confidence interval, LCI=lower bound of the confidence interval, UCI=upper bound of the \nconfidence interval \na Hazard ratio is estimated using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model.

The phase 2 part did not demonstrate efficacy of cabazitaxel as \nsingle agent in paediatric population with recurrent or refractory diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma \n(DIPG) and high grade glioma (HGG) treated at 30 mg/m². \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out in 170 patients including patients with advanced \nsolid tumours (n=69), metastatic breast cancer (n=34) and metastatic prostate cancer (n=67). These \npatients received cabazitaxel at doses of 10 to 30 mg/m2 weekly or every 3 weeks. \n \nAbsorption \nAfter 1-hour intravenous administration at 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic prostate \ncancer (n=67), the Cmax was 226 ng/ml (Coefficient of Variation (CV): 107%) and was reached at the \nend of the 1-hour infusion (Tmax). The mean AUC was 991 ng.h/ml (CV: 34%). \nNo major deviation to the dose proportionality was observed from 10 to 30 mg/m2 in patients with \nadvanced solid tumours (n=126). \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution (Vss) was 4870 l (2640 l/m2 for a patient with a median BSA of 1.84 m2) at \nsteady state. \nIn vitro, the binding of cabazitaxel to human serum proteins was 89-92% and was not saturable up to \n50,000 ng/ml, which covers the maximum concentration observed in clinical studies. Cabazitaxel is \nmainly bound to human serum albumin (82.0%) and lipoproteins (87.9% for HDL, 69.8% for LDL, and \n55.8% for VLDL). The in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.90 \nto 0.99 indicating that cabazitaxel was equally distributed between blood and plasma. \n \nBiotransformation \nCabazitaxel is extensively metabolised in the liver (>95%), mainly by the CYP3A isoenzyme (80% to \n90%). Cabazitaxel is the main circulating compound in human plasma. Seven metabolites were detected \nin plasma (including 3 active metabolites issued form O-demethylations), with the main one accounting \nfor 5% of parent exposure. Around 20 metabolites of cabazitaxel are excreted into human urine and \nfaeces. \nBased on in vitro studies, the potential risk of inhibition by cabazitaxel at clinically relevant \nconcentrations is possible towards medicinal products that are mainly substrate of CYP3A. However a \nclinical study has shown that cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 administered as a single 1-hour infusion) did not \nmodify the plasma levels of midazolam, a probe substrate of CYP3A. Therefore, at therapeutic doses, \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nco-administration of CYP3A substrates with cabazitaxel to patients is not expected to have any clinical \nimpact. \nThere is no potential risk of inhibition of medicinal products that are substrates of other CYP enzymes \n(1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C8, 2C19, 2E1, and 2D6) as well as no potential risk of induction by cabazitaxel on \nmedicinal products that are substrates of CYP1A, CYP2C9, and CYP3A. Cabazitaxel did not inhibit \nin vitro the major biotransformation pathway of warfarin into 7-hydroxywarfarin, which is mediated by \nCYP2C9. Therefore, no pharmacokinetic interaction of cabazitaxel on warfarin is expected in vivo. \nIn vitro cabazitaxel did not inhibit Multidrug-Resistant Proteins (MRP): MRP1 and MRP2 or Organic \nCation Transporter (OCT1). Cabazitaxel inhibited the transport of P-glycoprotein (PgP) (digoxin, \nvinblastin), Breast-Cancer-Resistant-Proteins (BCRP) (methotrexate) and Organic Anion Transporting \nPolypeptide OATP1B3 (CCK8) at concentrations at least 15 fold what is observed in clinical setting \nwhile it inhibited the transport of OATP1B1 (estradiol-17β-glucuronide) at concentrations only 5 fold \nwhat is observed in clinical setting. Therefore the risk of interaction with substrates of MRP, OCT1, \nPgP, BCRP and OATP1B3 is unlikely in vivo at the dose of 25 mg/m2. The risk of interaction with \nOATP1B1 transporter is possible, notably during the infusion duration (1 hour) and up to 20 minutes \nafter the end of the infusion (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nAfter a 1-hour intravenous infusion [14C]-cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 in patients, approximately 80% of \nthe administered dose was eliminated within 2 weeks. Cabazitaxel is mainly excreted in the faeces as \nnumerous metabolites (76% of the dose); while renal excretion of cabazitaxel and metabolites account \nfor less than 4% of the dose (2.3% as unchanged medicinal product in urine). \n \nCabazitaxel had a high plasma clearance of 48.5 1/h (26.4 1/h/m2 for a patient with a median BSA of \n1.84 m2) and a long terminal half-life of 95 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis in 70 patients of 65 years and older (57 from 65 to 75 and 13 \npatients above 75), no age effect on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel was observed. \n \nPaediatric patients \nSafety and effectiveness of cabazitaxel have not been established in children and adolescents below 18 \nyears of age. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCabazitaxel is eliminated primarily via liver metabolism. \nA dedicated study in 43 cancer patients with hepatic impairment showed no influence of mild (total \nbilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST >1.5 x ULN) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤3.0 x ULN) \nhepatic impairment on cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of \ncabazitaxel was 20 and 15 mg/m2, respectively. \nIn 3 patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 ULN), a 39% decrease in clearance was \nobserved when compared to patients with mild hepatic impairment, indicating some effect of severe \nhepatic impairment on cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics. The MTD of cabazitaxel in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment was not established. \nBased on safety and tolerability data, cabazitaxel dose should be reduced in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4). Cabazitaxel Accord is contraindicated in patients with moderate and \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nCabazitaxel is minimally excreted via the kidney (2.3% of the dose). A population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis carried out in 170 patients that included 14 patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance in the range of 30 to 50 ml/min) and 59 patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance in the range of 50 to 80 ml/min) showed that mild to moderate renal impairment did not have \nmeaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel. This was confirmed by a dedicated \ncomparative pharmacokinetic study in solid cancer patients with normal renal function (8 patients), \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nmoderate (8 patients) and severe (9 patients) renal impairment, who received several cycles of \ncabazitaxel in single intravenous infusion up to 25 mg/m2. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in dogs after single dose, 5-day and weekly \nadministation at exposure levels lower than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to \nclinical use were arteriolar/periarterolar necrosis in the liver, bile ductule hyperplasia and/or \nhepatocellular necrosis (see section 4.2). \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in rats during repeat-dose toxicity studies at \nexposure levels higher than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were eye \ndisorders characterized by subcapsular lens fiber swelling/degeneration. These effects were partially \nreversible after 8 weeks. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with cabazitaxel. \nCabazitaxel did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. It was not \nclastogenic in an in vitro test in human lymphocytes (no induction of structural chromosomal aberration \nbut it increased number of polyploid cells) and induced an increase of micronuclei in the in vivo test in \nrats. However these genotoxicity findings are inherent to the pharmacological activity of the compound \n(inhibition of tubulin depolymerization) and have been observed with medicinal products exhibiting the \nsame pharmacological activity. \n \nCabazitaxel did not affect mating performances or fertility of treated male rats. However, in repeated-\ndose toxicity studies, degeneration of seminal vesicle and seminiferous tubule atrophy in the testis were \nobserved in rats, and testicular degeneration (minimal epithelial single cell necrosis in epididymis), was \nobserved in dogs. Exposures in animals were similar or lower than those seen in humans receiving \nclinically relevant doses of cabazitaxel. \n \nCabazitaxel induced embryofoetal toxicity in female rats treated intravenously once daily from \ngestational days 6 through 17 linked with maternal toxicity and consisted of foetal deaths and decreased \nmean foetal weight associated with delay in skeletal ossification. Exposures in animals were lower than \nthose seen in humans receiving clinically relevant doses of cabazitaxel. Cabazitaxel crossed the placenta \nbarrier in rats. \n \nIn rats, cabazitaxel and its metabolites are excreted in maternal milk at a quantity up to 1.5% of \nadministered dose over 24 hours. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment \nResults of environmental risk assessment studies indicated that use of cabazitaxel will not cause \nsignificant risk to the aquatic environment (see section 6.6 for disposal of unused product). \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPolysorbate 80 \nCitric acid  \nEthanol anhydrous \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \nPVC infusion containers or polyurethane infusion sets should not be used for the preparation and \nadministration of the infusion solution. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years. \n \nAfter opening \nEach vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, in-\nuse storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \nAfter final dilution in the infusion bag/bottle \nChemical and physical stability of the infusion solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours at ambient \ntemperature (15°C - 30°C) including the 1-hour infusion time and for 48 hours at refrigerated conditions \nincluding the 1-hour infusion time. \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally \nnot be longer than 24 hour at 2°C – 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated \naseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. Store in the original \npackage in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n3 ml of concentrate in a 6 ml clear tubular glass vial (type I) closed with a 20 mm grey siliconized \nrubber closure (type I) with teflon film on plug surface and sealed by an aluminium cap covered with a \nviolet plastic flip-off cap. \n \nEach carton contains one single use vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handing \n \nCabazitaxel should only be prepared and administered by personnel trained in handling cytotoxic \nagents. Pregnant staff should not handle the product. As for any other antineoplastic agent, caution \nshould be exercised when handling and preparing cabazitaxel solutions, taking into account the use of \ncontainment devices, personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves), and preparation procedures. If \ncabazitaxel, at any step of its handling, should come into contact with the skin, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration  \n \nDO NOT use together with other cabazitaxel medicinal products with a different concentration \ncabazitaxel. Cabazitaxel Accord contains 20 mg/ml of cabazitaxel (at least 3 ml deliverable volume). \nEach vial is of single use and should be used immediately. Discard any unused solution. \nMore than one vial of Cabazitaxel Accord may be necessary to administer the prescribed dose. \n \nThe dilution process must be carried out in an aseptic manner for preparing the solution for infusion. \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nPreparation of the infusion solution  \n \nStep 1 \nAseptically withdraw the required volume of \nCabazitaxel Accord (which contains 20 mg/ml of \ncabazitaxel), with a graduated syringe fitted with a \nneedle. As an example, a dose of 45 mg cabazitaxel \nwould require 2.25 ml of the Cabazitaxel Accord. \n\n \n  \n\nStep 2 \nInject in a sterile PVC-free container of either 5% \nglucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for infusion. The concentration of the \ninfusion solution should be between 0.10 mg/ml and \n0.26 mg/ml. \n \n\n \nStep 3 \nRemove the syringe and mix the content of the \ninfusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking \nmotion. The infusion solution is clear colourless \nsolution. \n\n \nStep 4 \nAs with all parenteral products, the resulting \ninfusion solution should be visually inspected prior \nto use. As the infusion solution is supersaturated, it \nmay crystallize over time. In this case, the solution \nmust not be used and should be discarded. \n\n \n \nThe infusion solution should be used immediately. However, in-use storage time can be longer under \nspecific conditions mentioned in section 6.3. \n \nAn in-line filter of 0.22 micrometer nominal pore size (also referred to as 0.2 micrometer) is \nrecommended during administration. \n \nDo not use PVC infusion containers or polyurethane infusion sets for the preparation and administration \nof cabazitaxel. \n \nCabazitaxel must not be mixed with any other medicinal products than those mentioned. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n \n7.

See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1 What Cabazitaxel Accord is and what it is used for \n2 What you need to know before you are given Cabazitaxel Accord \n3 How to use Cabazitaxel Accord \n4 Possible side effects \n5 How to store Cabazitaxel Accord \n6 Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Cabazitaxel Accord is and what it is used for \n \nThe name of your medicine is Cabazitaxel Accord. Its common name is cabazitaxel. It belongs to a \ngroup of medicines called “taxanes” used to treat cancers. \n \nCabazitaxel Accord is used to treat adults with prostate cancer that has progressed after having had \nother chemotherapy. It works by stopping cells from growing and multiplying. \n \nAs part of your treatment, you will also take a corticosteroid medicine (prednisone or prednisolone) by \nmouth every day. Ask your doctor to give you information about this other medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Cabazitaxel Accord \n \nDo not use Cabazitaxel Accord if \n• you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabazitaxel, to other taxanes, or polysorbate 80 or any of the \n\nother excipients of this medicine (listed in section 6), \n• the number of your white blood cells is too low (neutrophil counts less than or equal to \n\n1,500/mm3), \n• you have severe abnormal liver function, \n• you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever. \n \nYou should not be given Cabazitaxel Accord if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, \ntalk to your doctor before having Cabazitaxel Accord. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nBefore each treatment with Cabazitaxel Accord, you will have blood tests to check that you have \nenough blood cells and sufficient liver and kidney functions to receive Cabazitaxel Accord. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if: \n• you have fever. During treatment with Cabazitaxel Accord, it is more likely that your white blood \n\ncell count may be reduced. Your doctor will monitor your blood and general condition for signs \nof infections. He/she may give you other medicines to maintain the number of your blood cells. \nPeople with low blood counts can develop life-threatening infections. The earliest sign of \ninfection may be fever, so if you experience fever, tell your doctor right away. \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n• you have ever had any allergies. Serious allergic reactions can occur during treatment with \nCabazitaxel Accord. \n\n• you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, you feel sick (nausea) or you are being sick \n(vomiting). Any of these events could cause severe dehydration. Your doctor may need to treat \nyou. \n\n• you have feeling of numbness, tingling, burning or decreased sensation in your hands or feet. \n• you have any bleeding problems from the gut or have changes in the colour of your stool or \n\nstomach pain. If the bleeding or pain is severe, your doctor will stop your treatment with \nCabazitaxel Accord. This is because Cabazitaxel Accord may increase the risk of bleeding or \ndeveloping holes in the gut wall. \n\n• you have kidney problems. \n• liver problems occur during the treatment. \n• you experience any significant increase or decrease in daily urinary volume. \n• you have blood in your urine. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. Your doctor may reduce the dose of \nCabazitaxel Accord or stop the treatment. \n \nOther medicines and Cabazitaxel Accord \nPlease tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because some medicines can affect the \nway Cabazitaxel Accord works or Cabazitaxel Accord can affect how other medicines work. These \nmedicines include the following: \n• ketoconazole, rifampicin (for infections); \n• carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin (for seizures); \n• St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal remedy for depression and other conditions); \n• statins (such as simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pravastatin) (for reducing the \n\ncholesterol in your blood); \n• valsartan (for hypertension); \n• repaglinide (for diabetes). \n \nTalk to your doctor before getting vaccinations while you are receiving Cabazitaxel Accord. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nCabazitaxel Accord should not be used in pregnant women or women of childbearing age not using \ncontraception. \n \nCabazitaxel Accord should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nUse a condom during sex if your partner is or could become pregnant. Cabazitaxel Accord could be \npresent in your semen and may affect the foetus. You are advised not to father a child during and up \nto 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because \nCabazitaxel Accord may alter male fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel tired or dizzy when having this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or use any \ntools or machines until you feel better. \n \nCabazitaxel Accord contains ethanol (alcohol) \n \nThis medicine contains 1,185 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each vial, which is equivalent to \n16.33 Vol %. The amount in dose of this medicine is equivalent to 30 ml beer or 12 ml wine. \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likely to have an effect in adults. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nThe alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist if you are taking other medicines. \n \nIf you are addicted to alcohol, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to use Cabazitaxel Accord  \n \nInstructions for use \nAnti-allergic medicines will be given to you before you have Cabazitaxel Accord to reduce the risk \nof allergic reactions. \n \n• Cabazitaxel Accord will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse. \n• Cabazitaxel Accord must be prepared (diluted) before it is given. Practical information for \n\nhandling and administration of Cabazitaxel Accord for doctors, nurses and pharmacists is \nprovided with this leaflet. \n\n• Cabazitaxel Accord will be given by a drip (infusion) into one of your veins (intravenous use) in \nhospital for about an hour. \n\n• As part of your treatment, you will also take a corticosteroid medicine (prednisone or \nprednisolone) by mouth every day. \n\n \nHow much and how often to have \n• The usual dose depends on your body surface area. Your doctor will calculate your body surface \n\narea in square meters (m²) and will decide the dose you should have. \n• You will usually have an infusion once every 3 weeks. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Your \ndoctor will discuss these with you and will explain the potential risks and benefits of your treatment. \n \nSee a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects: \n• fever (high temperature). This is very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \n• severe loss of body fluids (dehydration). This is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n• This can occur if you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, or fever, or if you are being sick \n\n(vomiting). \n• severe stomach pain or stomach pain that doesn't go away. This can occur if you have a hole in \n\nthe stomach, food pipe, gut or bowel (gastrointestinal perforation). This can lead to death. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• decrease in the number of red (anaemia), or white blood cells (which are important in fighting \n\ninfection) \n• decrease in the number of platelets (which results in increased risk of bleeding) \n• loss of appetite (anorexia) \n• alteration in sense of taste \n• shortness of breath \n• cough \n• stomach upsets including feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea or constipation \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n• abdominal pain \n• short term hair loss (in most cases normal hair growth should return) \n• back pain \n• joint pain \n• blood in the urine \n• feeling tired, weak or lack of energy. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• urinary tract infection \n• lack of white blood cells associated with fever and infection \n• feeling of numbness, tingling, burning or decreased sensations in hands and feet \n• dizziness \n• headache \n• decrease or increase in blood pressure \n• uncomfortable feeling in the stomach, heart burn or belching \n• stomach pain \n• haemorrhoids \n• muscle spasm \n• painful or frequent urination \n• urinary incontinence \n• kidney disease or problems \n• sore in the mouth or on lips \n• infections or risk of infections \n• high blood sugar \n• low blood potassium \n• mental confusion \n• feeling anxious \n• abnormal feeling or loss of sensation or pain in hands and feet \n• ringing in the ear \n• trouble with balance \n• rapid or irregular heartbeat \n• blood clot in the leg \n• skin feeling hot or flushed \n• pain in mouth or throat \n• rectal bleeding \n• redness of the skin \n• muscle discomfort, aches or  pain \n• swelling of the feet or legs \n• chills \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n• inflammation of the bladder, which can occur when your bladder has been previously exposed \n\nto radiation therapy (cystitis due to radiation recall phenomenon). \n \nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n• interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the lungs causing coughing and difficulty breathing). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

If not used immediately, in-\nuse storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \nAfter final dilution in the infusion bag/bottle \nChemical and physical stability of the infusion solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours at ambient \ntemperature (15°C - 30°C) including the 1-hour infusion time and for 48 hours at refrigerated \nconditions including the 1-hour infusion time. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally \nnot be longer than 24 hour at 2°C-8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated \naseptic conditions. \n \nPreparation and administration precautions \nAs for any other antineoplastic agent, caution should be exercised when handling and preparing \nCabazitaxel Accord solutions, taking into account the use of containment devices, personal protective \nequipment (e.g. gloves), and preparation procedures. \nIf Cabazitaxel Accord, at any step of its handling, should come into contact with the skin, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous \nmembranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. \n \nCabazitaxel Accord should only be prepared and administered by personnel trained in handling \ncytotoxic agents.

Discard any unused solution. \nMore than one vial of Cabazitaxel Accord may be necessary to administer the prescribed dose. \n \nThe dilution process must be carried out in an aseptic manner for preparing the solution for infusion. \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nPreparation of the infusion solution  \n \nStep 1 \nAseptically withdraw the required volume of \nCabazitaxel Accord (which contains 20 mg/ml of \ncabazitaxel), with a graduated syringe fitted with a \nneedle. As an example, a dose of 45 mg \ncabazitaxel would require 2.25 ml of the \nCabazitaxel Accord. \n\n \n  \n\nStep 2 \nInject in a sterile PVC-free container of either 5% \nglucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for infusion. The concentration of \nthe infusion solution should be between \n0.10 mg/ml and 0.26 mg/ml. \n \n\n \nStep 3 \nRemove the syringe and mix the content of the \ninfusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking \nmotion. The infusion solution is clear colourless \nsolution. \n\n \nStep 4 \nAs with all parenteral products, the resulting \ninfusion solution should be visually inspected prior \nto use. As the infusion solution is supersaturated, it \nmay crystallize over time. In this case, the solution \nmust not be used and should be discarded. \n\n \n \nThe infusion solution should be used immediately. Information on shelf life and special precautions \nfor storage are above. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nMethod of administration \nCabazitaxel Accord is administered as a 1 hour infusion. \nAn in-line filter of 0.22 micrometer nominal pore size (also referred to as 0.2 micrometer) is \nrecommended during administration. \nPVC infusion containers or polyurethane infusion sets should not be used for the preparation and \nadministration of the infusion solution. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
