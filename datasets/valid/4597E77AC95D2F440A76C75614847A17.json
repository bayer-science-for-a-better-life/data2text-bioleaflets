NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nArsenic trioxide medac 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of arsenic trioxide. \nOne vial of 10 ml contains 10 mg of arsenic trioxide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nSterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution, free from particles. The pH of the solution is 6.0-8.0. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nArsenic trioxide medac is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients \nwith: \n\u2022 Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood \n\ncell count, \u2264 10 x 10\u00b3/\u00b5l) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) \n\u2022 Relapsed/refractory APL (previous treatment should have included a retinoid and \n\nchemotherapy) \ncharacterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the pro-myelocytic \nleukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR\u03b1) gene. \n \nThe response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been \nexamined. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nArsenic trioxide medac must be administered under the supervision of a physician who is experienced \nin the management of acute leukaemias, and the special monitoring procedures described in \nsection 4.4 must be followed. \n \nPosology \n \nThe same dose is recommended for adults and elderly. \n \nNewly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk APL \n \nInduction treatment schedule \nArsenic trioxide medac must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, given daily \nuntil complete remission (CR) is achieved. If CR has not occurred by day 60, dosing must be \ndiscontinued. \n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nConsolidation schedule \nArsenic trioxide medac must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 days per \nweek. Treatment should be continued for 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 cycles. \n \nRelapsed/refractory APL \n \nInduction treatment schedule \nArsenic trioxide medac must be administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day given \ndaily until CR is achieved (less than 5% blasts present in cellular bone marrow with no evidence of \nleukaemic cells). If CR has not occurred by day 50, dosing must be discontinued. \n \nConsolidation schedule \nConsolidation treatment must begin 3 to 4 weeks after completion of induction therapy. Arsenic \ntrioxide medac is to be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 25 doses given \n5 days per week, followed by 2 days interruption, repeated for 5 weeks. \n \nDose delay, modification and reinitiation \n \nTreatment with Arsenic trioxide medac must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of \ntherapy at any time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute common toxicity \ncriteria (CTC) is observed and judged to be possibly related to Arsenic trioxide medac treatment. \nPatients who experience such reactions that are considered Arsenic trioxide medac related must \nresume treatment only after resolution of the toxic event or after recovery to baseline status of the \nabnormality that prompted the interruption. In such cases, treatment must resume at 50% of the \npreceding daily dose. If the toxic event does not recur within 7 days of restarting treatment at the \nreduced dose, the daily dose can be escalated back to 100% of the original dose. Patients who \nexperience a recurrence of toxicity must be removed from treatment. For electrocardiogram (ECG), \nelectrolyte abnormalities and hepatotoxicity see section 4.4. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \nduring the treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic trioxide \nmedac in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic \ntrioxide medac in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Arsenic trioxide medac in children aged up to 17 years has not been \nestablished. Currently available data for children aged 5 to 16 years are described in section 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. No data are available for children under 5 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nArsenic trioxide medac must be administered intravenously over 1-2 hours. The infusion duration may \nbe extended up to 4 hours if vasomotor reactions are observed. A central venous catheter is not \nrequired. Patients must be hospitalised at the beginning of treatment due to symptoms of disease and \nto ensure adequate monitoring. \n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinically unstable APL patients are especially at risk and will require more frequent monitoring of \nelectrolyte and glycaemia levels as well as more frequent haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \nparameter tests. \n \nLeukocyte activation syndrome (APL differentiation syndrome) \n \n27 % of patients with APL, in the relapsed/refractory setting, treated with arsenic trioxide have \nexperienced symptoms similar to a syndrome called the retinoic-acid-acute promyelocytic leukaemia \n(RA-APL) or APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight gain, \npulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis. This syndrome \ncan be fatal. In newly diagnosed APL patients treated with arsenic trioxide and ATRA, APL \ndifferentiation syndrome was observed in 19 % including 5 severe cases. At the first signs that could \nsuggest the syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnoea and/or weight gain, abnormal chest auscultatory \nfindings or radiographic abnormalities), treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac must be temporarily \ndiscontinued and high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously twice a day) must be \nimmediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count and continued for at least 3 days or longer \nuntil signs and symptoms have abated. If clinically justified/required, concomitant diuretic therapy is \nalso recommended. The majority of patients do not require permanent termination of Arsenic trioxide \nmedac therapy during treatment of the APL differentiation syndrome. As soon as signs and symptoms \nhave subsided, treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac can be resumed at 50 % of the previous dose \nduring the first 7 days. Thereafter, in the absence of worsening of the previous toxicity, Arsenic \ntrioxide medac might be resumed at full dosage. In the case of the reappearance of symptoms Arsenic \ntrioxide medac should be reduced to the previous dosage. In order to prevent the development of the \nAPL differentiation syndrome during induction treatment, prednisone (0.5 mg/kg body weight per day \nthroughout induction treatment) may be administered from day 1 of Arsenic trioxide medac \napplication to the end of induction therapy in APL patients. It is recommended that chemotherapy not \nbe added to treatment with steroids since there is no experience with administration of both steroids \nand chemotherapy during treatment of the leukocyte activation syndrome due to Arsenic trioxide \nmedac. Post-marketing experience suggests that a similar syndrome may occur in patients with other \ntypes of malignancy. Monitoring and management for these patients should be as described above. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nECG abnormalities \n \nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block. QT \nprolongation can lead to a torsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. Previous \ntreatment with anthracyclines may increase the risk of QT prolongation. The risk of torsade de pointes \nis related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts (such as class Ia and III antiarrythmics (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide), \nantipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), some macrolides (e.g. \nerythromycin), some antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole), some quinolone antibiotics (e.g. \nsparfloxacin), and other individual medicinal products known to increase QT interval (e.g. cisapride)), \na history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, \nadministration of potassium-wasting diuretics, amphotericin B or other conditions that result in \nhypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia. In clinical studies, in the relapsed/refractory setting, 40 % of \npatients treated with arsenic trioxide experienced at least one QT corrected (QTc) interval \nprolongation greater than 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks \nafter arsenic trioxide infusion, and then returned to baseline by the end of 8 weeks after arsenic \ntrioxide infusion. One patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including \namphotericin B) had asymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL with \narsenic trioxide. In newly diagnosed APL patients 15.6 % showed QTc prolongation with arsenic \ntrioxide in combination with ATRA (see section 4.8). In one newly diagnosed patient induction \ntreatment was terminated because of severe prolongation of the QTc interval and electrolyte \nabnormalities on day 3 of induction treatment. \n \nECG and electrolyte monitoring recommendations \n \nPrior to initiating therapy with Arsenic trioxide medac, a 12-lead ECG must be performed and serum \nelectrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine must be assessed; preexisting \nelectrolyte abnormalities must be corrected and, if possible, medicinal products that are known to \nprolong the QT interval must be discontinued. Patients with risk factors of QTc prolongation or risk \nfactors of torsade de pointes should be monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring (ECG). For QTc \ngreater than 500 msec, corrective measures must be completed and the QTc reassessed with serial \nECGs and, if available, a specialist advice could be sought prior to considering using Arsenic trioxide \nmedac. During therapy with Arsenic trioxide medac, potassium concentrations must be kept above \n4 mEq/l and magnesium concentrations must be kept above 1.8 mg/dl. Patients who reach an absolute \nQT interval value > 500 msec must be reassessed and immediate action must be taken to correct \nconcomitant risk factors, if any, while the risk/benefit of continuing versus suspending Arsenic \ntrioxide medac therapy must be considered. If syncope, rapid or irregular heartbeat develops, the \npatient must be hospitalised and monitored continuously, serum electrolytes must be assessed, Arsenic \ntrioxide medac therapy must be temporarily discontinued until the QTc interval regresses to below \n460 msec, electrolyte abnormalities are corrected, and the syncope and irregular heartbeat cease. After \nrecovery, treatment should be resumed at 50 % of the preceding daily dose. If QTc prolongation does \nnot recur within 7 days of restarting treatment at the reduced dose, treatment with Arsenic trioxide \nmedac can be resumed at 0.11 mg/kg body weight per day for a second week. The daily dose can be \nescalated back to 100 % of the original dose if no prolongation occurs. There are no data on the effect \nof arsenic trioxide on the QTc interval during the infusion. ECGs must be obtained twice weekly, and \nmore frequently for clinically unstable patients, during induction and consolidation. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatotoxicity (grade 3 or greater) \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2 % developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with \nATRA (see section 4.8). However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either \narsenic trioxide, ATRA or both. Treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac must be discontinued before \nthe scheduled end of therapy at any time that a hepatotoxicity grade 3 or greater on the CTC is \nobserved. As soon as bilirubin and/or SGOT and/or alkaline phosphatase are decreased to below \n4 times the normal upper level, treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac should be resumed at 50 % of \nthe previous dose during the first 7 days. Thereafter, in absence of worsening of the previous toxicity, \nArsenic trioxide medac should be resumed at full dosage. In case of reappearance of hepatotoxicity, \nArsenic trioxide medac must be permanently discontinued. \n \nDose delay and modification \n \nTreatment with Arsenic trioxide medac must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of \ntherapy at any time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute CTC is observed \nand judged to be possibly related to Arsenic trioxide medac treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nThe patient\u2019s electrolyte and glycaemia levels, as well as haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \nparameter tests must be monitored at least twice weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable \npatients during the induction phase and at least weekly during the consolidation phase. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic \ntrioxide medac in patients with renal impairment. The experience in patients with severe renal \nimpairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required. \nThe use of Arsenic trioxide medac in patients on dialysis has not been studied. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \nduring the treatment with arsenic trioxide caution is advised in the use of Arsenic trioxide medac in \npatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 on hepatotoxicity and section 4.8). The experience in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required. \n \nElderly \n \nThere is limited clinical data on the use of Arsenic trioxide medac in the elderly population. Caution is \nneeded in these patients. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHyperleukocytosis \n \nTreatment with arsenic trioxide has been associated with the development of hyperleukocytosis \n(\u2265 10 x 10\u00b3/\u03bcl) in some relapsed/refractory APL patients. There did not appear to be a relationship \nbetween baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts and development of hyperleukocytosis nor did there \nappear to be a correlation between baseline WBC count and peak WBC counts. Hyperleukocytosis \nwas never treated with additional chemotherapy and resolved on continuation of arsenic trioxide. \nWBC counts during consolidation were not as high as during induction treatment and were \n< 10 x 10\u00b3/\u03bcl, except in one patient who had a WBC count of 22 x 10\u00b3/\u03bcl during consolidation. Twenty \nrelapsed/refractory APL patients (50 %) experienced leukocytosis; however, in all these patients, the \nWBC count was declining or had normalised by the time of bone marrow remission and cytotoxic \nchemotherapy or leukopheresis was not required. In newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate \nrisk APL leukocytosis developed during induction therapy in 35 of 74 (47 %) patients (see \nsection 4.8). However all cases were successfully managed with hydroxyurea therapy. \n \nIn newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory APL patients who develop sustained leukocytosis after \ninitiation of therapy, hydroxyurea should be administered. Hydroxyurea should be continued at a \ngiven dose to keep the white blood cell count \u2264 10 x 10\u00b3/\u03bcl and subsequently tapered. \n \nTable 1 Recommendation for initiation of hydroxyurea \nWBC Hydroxyurea \n10\u201350 x 10\u00b3/\u00b5l 500 mg four times a day \n> 50 x 10\u00b3/\u00b5l 1,000 mg four times a day \n\n \nDevelopment of second primary malignancies \n \nThe active ingredient of Arsenic trioxide medac, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor \npatients for the development of second primary malignancies. \n \nEncephalopathy \n \nCases of encephalopathy were reported with treatment with arsenic trioxide. Wernicke encephalopathy \nafter arsenic trioxide treatment was reported in patients with vitamin B1 deficiency. Patients at risk of \nB1 deficiency should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of encephalopathy after arsenic \ntrioxide initiation. Some cases recovered with vitamin B1 supplementation. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal assessments of pharmacokinetic interactions between Arsenic trioxide medac and other \ntherapeutic medicinal products have been conducted. \n \nMedicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation, hypokalaemia or \nhypomagnesaemia \n \nQT/QTc prolongation is expected during treatment with arsenic trioxide, and torsade de pointes and \ncomplete heart block have been reported. Patients who are receiving, or who have received, medicinal \nproducts known to cause hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, such as diuretics or amphotericin B, \nmay be at higher risk for torsade de pointes. Caution is advised when Arsenic trioxide medac is \ncoadministered with other medicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation such as \nmacrolide antibiotics, the antipsychotic thioridazine, or medicinal products known to cause \nhypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia. Additional information about QT prolonging medicinal agents, is \nprovided in section 4.4. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nMedicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic effects \n \nHepatotoxic effects may occur during the treatment with arsenic trioxide, caution is advised when \nArsenic trioxide medac is coadministered with other medicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic \neffects (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nOther antileukaemic medicinal products \n \nThe influence of Arsenic trioxide medac on the efficacy of other antileukaemic medicinal products is \nunknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential and men must use effective contraception during treatment with \nArsenic trioxide medac. \n \nPregnancy \n \nArsenic trioxide has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using Arsenic trioxide medac. If this medicinal product is \nused during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product, the patient must \nbe informed of the potential harm to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nArsenic is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in \nbreast-feeding children from Arsenic trioxide medac, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to and \nthroughout administration. \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical or non-clinical fertility studies have been conducted with Arsenic trioxide medac. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nArsenic trioxide medac has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRelated adverse reactions of CTC grade 3 and 4 occurred in 37 % of relapsed/refractory APL patients \nin clinical trials. The most commonly reported reactions were hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, \nneutropenia, and increased alanine amino transferase (ALT). Leukocytosis occurred in 50 % of \npatients with relapsed/refractory APL, as determined by haematology assessments. \n \nSerious adverse reactions were common (1-10 %) and not unexpected in the relapsed/refractory \npopulation. Those serious adverse reactions attributed to arsenic trioxide included APL differentiation \nsyndrome (3), leukocytosis (3), prolonged QT interval (4, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial \nfibrillation/atrial flutter (1), hyperglycaemia (2) and a variety of serious adverse reactions related to \nhaemorrhage, infections, pain, diarrhoea, nausea. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn general, treatment-emergent adverse events tended to decrease over time, in relapsed/refractory \nAPL patients perhaps accounted for by amelioration of the underlying disease process. Patients tended \nto tolerate consolidation and maintenance treatment with less toxicity than in induction. This is \nprobably due to the confounding of adverse events by the uncontrolled disease process early on in the \ntreatment course and the myriad concomitant medicinal products required to control symptoms and \nmorbidity. \n \nIn a phase 3, multicentre, noninferiority trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy with ATRA plus \narsenic trioxide in newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk APL patients (Study APL0406; see also \nsection 5.1), serious adverse reactions including hepatic toxicity, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and \nQTc prolongation were observed in patients treated with arsenic trioxide. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following undesirable effects have been reported in the APL0406 study in newly diagnosed \npatients and in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience in relapsed/refractory APL patients. \nUndesirable effects are listed in table 2 below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and \nfrequencies observed during arsenic trioxide clinical trials in 52 patients with refractory/relapsed APL. \nFrequencies are defined as: (very common \u2265 1/10), (common \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), (uncommon \n\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2 \n All grades Grades \u2265 3 \nInfections and infestations \nHerpes zoster Common Not known \nSepsis Not known Not known \nPneumonia Not known Not known \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders   \nFebrile neutropenia Common Common \nLeukocytosis Common Common \nNeutropenia Common Common \nPancytopenia Common Common \nThrombocytopenia Common Common \nAnaemia Common Not known \nLeukopenia Not known Not known \nLymphopenia Not known Not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nHyperglycaemia Very Common Very Common \nHypokalaemia Very Common Very Common \nHypomagnesaemia Very Common Common \nHypernatraemia Common Common \nKetoacidosis Common Common \nHypermagnesaemia Common Not known \nDehydration Not known Not known \nFluid retention Not known Not known \nPsychiatric disorders \nConfusional state Not known Not known \nNervous system disorders   \nParaesthesia Very Common Common \nDizziness Very Common Not known \nHeadache Very Common Not known \nConvulsion Common Not known \nEncephalopathy, Wernicke \nencephalopathy \n\nNot known Not known \n\n\n\n10 \n\nEye disorders \nVision blurred Common Not known \nCardiac disorders \nTachycardia Very Common Common \nPericardial effusion Common Common \nVentricular extrasystoles Common Not known \nCardiac failure Not known Not known \nVentricular tachycardia Not known Not known \nVascular disorders \nVasculitis Common Common \nHypotension Common Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nDifferentiation syndrome Very Common Very Common \nDyspnoea Very Common Common \nHypoxia Common Common \nPleural effusion Common Common \nPleuritic pain Common Common \nPulmonary alveolar haemorrhage Common Common \nPneumonitis Not known Not known \nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhoea Very Common Common \nVomiting Very Common Not known \nNausea Very Common Not known \nAbdominal pain Common Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nPruritus Very Common Not known \nRash Very Common Not known \nErythema Common Common \nFace oedema Common Not known \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMyalgia Very Common Common \nArthralgia Common Common \nBone pain Common Common \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRenal failure Common Not known \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nPyrexia Very Common Common \nPain Very Common Common \nFatigue Very Common Not known \nOedema Very Common Not known \nChest pain Common Common \nChills Common Not known \nInvestigations \nAlanine amino transferase increased Very Common Common \nAspartate amino transferase increased Very Common Common \nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged Very Common Common \nHyperbilirubinaemia Common Common \nBlood creatinine increased Common Not known \nWeight increased Common Not known \nGamma-glutamyltransferase increased* Not known* Not known* \n*In the CALGB study C9710, 2 cases of grade \u2265 3 increased GGT were reported out of the \n200 patients who received arsenic trioxide consolidation cycles (cycle 1 and cycle 2) versus none in \nthe control arm. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDifferentiation syndrome \n \nDuring arsenic trioxide treatment, 14 of the 52 patients in the APL studies in the relapsed setting had \none or more symptoms of APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight \ngain, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis (see \nsection 4.4). Twenty-seven patients had leukocytosis (WBC \u2265 10 x 10\u00b3/ \u03bcl) during induction, 4 of \nwhom had values above 100,000/ \u03bcl. Baseline WBCcounts did not correlate with development of \nleukocytosis on study, and WBC counts during consolidation therapy were not as high as during \ninduction. In these studies, leukocytosis was not treated with chemotherapeutic medicinal products. \nMedicinal products that are used to lower the white blood cell count often exacerbate the toxicities \nassociated with leukocytosis, and no standard approach has proven effective. One patient treated under \na compassionate use program died from cerebral infarct due to leukocytosis, following treatment with \nchemotherapeutic medicinal products to lower WBC count. Observation is the recommended approach \nwith intervention only in selected cases. \n \nMortality in the pivotal studies in the relapsed setting from disseminated intravascular coagulation \n(DIC) associated haemorrhage was very common (> 10%), which is consistent with the early mortality \nreported in the literature. \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, differentiation syndrome was observed \nin 19 % including 5 severe cases. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, a differentiation syndrome, like retinoic acid syndrome, has also been \nreported for the treatment of malignancies other than APL with arsenic trioxide. \n \nQT interval prolongation \n \nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation (see section 4.4). QT prolongation can lead to a \ntorsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. The risk of torsade de pointes is \nrelated to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts, a history of torsade de pointes, preexisting QT interval prolongation, congestive heart \nfailure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalaemia \nor hypomagnesaemia. One patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including \namphotericin B) had asymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL with \narsenic trioxide. She went onto consolidation without further evidence of QT prolongation. \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients, with low to intermediate risk APL, QTc prolongation was observed in \n15.6 %. In one patient induction treatment was terminated because of severe prolongation of the QTc \ninterval and electrolyte abnormalities on day 3. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n \nPeripheral neuropathy, characterised by paraesthesia/dysesthesia, is a common and well-known effect \nof environmental arsenic. Only 2 relapsed/refractory APL patients discontinued treatment early due to \nthis adverse reaction and one went on to receive additional arsenic trioxide on a subsequent protocol. \nForty-four percent of relapsed/refractory APL patients experienced symptoms that could be associated \nwith neuropathy; most were mild to moderate and were reversible upon cessation of treatment with \narsenic trioxide. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nHepatotoxicity (grade 3-4) \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2 % developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with \nATRA. However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either arsenic trioxide, \nATRA or both (see section 4.4). \n \nHaematological and gastrointestinal toxicity \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, gastrointestinal toxicity, grade 3-4 \nneutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred, however these were 2.2 times less frequent \nin patients treated with arsenic trioxide in combination with ATRA compared to patients treated with \nATRA + chemotherapy. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf symptoms suggestive of serious acute arsenic toxicity (e.g. convulsions, muscle weakness and \nconfusion) appear, Arsenic trioxide medac must be immediately discontinued and chelating therapy \nwith penicillamine at a daily dose \u2264 1 g per day may be considered. The duration of treatment with \npenicillamine must be evaluated taking into account the urinary arsenic laboratory values. For patients \nwho cannot take oral medicinal product, dimercaprol administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg \nintramuscularly every 4 hours until any immediately life-threatening toxicity has subsided may be \nconsidered. Thereafter, penicillamine at a daily dose \u2264 1 g per day may be given. In the presence of \ncoagulopathy, the oral administration of the chelating agent Dimercaptosuccinic Acid Succimer (DCI) \n10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m\u00b2 every 8 hours during 5 days and then every 12 hours during 2 weeks is \nrecommended. For patients with severe, acute arsenic overdose, dialysis should be considered \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX27 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of Arsenic trioxide medac is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide \ncauses morphological changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of \napoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage \nor degradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR\u03b1. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed non high risk APL patients \n \nArsenic trioxide has been investigated in 77 newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk \nAPL, in a controlled, randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and \nsafety of arsenic trioxide combined with ATRA with those of ATRA + chemotherapy (eg, idarubicin \nand mitoxantrone) (Study APL0406). Patients with newly diagnosed APL confirmed by the presence \nof t(15;17) or PML/RAR\u03b1 by RT-PCR or micro speckled PML nuclear distribution in leukaemic cells \nwere included. No data are available on patients with variant translocations like t(11;17) \n(PLZF/RAR\u03b1). Patients with significant arrhythmias, ECG abnormalities (congenital long QT \nsyndrome, history or presence of significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmia, clinically significant \nresting bradycardia (< 50 beats per minute), QTc > 450 msec on screening ECG, right bundle branch \nblock plus left anterior hemiblock, bifascicular block) or neuropathy were excluded from the study. \nPatients in the ATRA + arsenic trioxide treatment group received oral ATRA at 45 mg/m\u00b2 daily and \nIV arsenic trioxide at 0.15 mg/kg daily until CR. During consolidation, ATRA was given at the same \ndose for periods of 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off for a total of 7 courses, and arsenic trioxide was given \nat the same dose 5 days per week, 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 courses. Patients in the \nATRA + chemotherapy treatment group received IV idarubicin at 12 mg/m\u00b2 on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 and \noral ATRA at 45 mg/m\u00b2 daily until CR. During consolidation, patients received idarubicin at 5 mg/m\u00b2 \non days 1 to 4 and ATRA at 45 mg/m\u00b2 daily for 15 days, then IV mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1 \nto 5 and ATRA again at 45 mg/m\u00b2 daily for 15 days, and finally a single dose of idarubicin at \n12 mg/m\u00b2 and ATRA at 45 mg/m\u00b2 daily for 15 days. Each course of consolidation was initiated at \nhaematological recovery from the previous course defined as absolute neutrophil count > 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets > 100 x 109/L. Patients in the ATRA + chemotherapy treatment group also received \nmaintenance treatment for up to 2 years, consisting of oral 6-mercaptopurine at 50 mg/m\u00b2 daily, \nintramuscular methotrexate at 15 mg/m\u00b2 weekly, and ATRA at 45 mg/m\u00b2 daily for 15 days every \n3 months. \n \nThe key efficacy results are summarised in table 3 below: \n \nTable 3 \n\nEndpoint ATRA + \narsenic \ntrioxide \n(n = 77) \n\n[%] \n\nATRA + \nChemotherapy \n\n(n = 79) \n[%] \n\nConfidence \ninterval (CI) \n\nP-value \n\n2-year event-free \nsurvival (EFS) 97 86 \n\n95 % CI for the \ndifference, 2-22 \n\npercentage \npoints \n\np < 0.001 \nfor noninferiority \n\n \np = 0.02 \n\nfor superiority of \nATRA+arsenic \n\ntrioxide \nHaematalogic \ncomplete remission \n(HCR) \n\n100 95 \n \n\np = 0.12 \n\n2-year overall \nsurvival (OS) 99 91 \n\n p = 0.02 \n\n2-year disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) 97 90 \n\n p = 0.11 \n\n2-year cumulative \nincidence of relapse \n(CIR) \n\n1 6 \n \n\np = 0.24 \n\nAPL = acute promyelocytic leukaemia; ATRA = all-trans-retinoic acid \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nRelapsed/refractory APL \n \nArsenic trioxide has been investigated in 52 APL patients, previously treated with an anthracycline \nand a retinoid regimen, in two open-label, single-arm, non-comparative studies. One was a single \ninvestigator clinical study (n = 12) and the other was a multicentre, 9-institution study (n = 40). \nPatients in the first study received a median dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day of arsenic trioxide (range 0.06 to \n0.20 mg/kg/day) and patients in the multicentre study received a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. \nArsenic trioxide was administered intravenously over 1 to 2 hours until the bone marrow was free of \nleukaemic cells, up to a maximum of 60 days. Patients with CR received consolidation therapy with \narsenic trioxide for 25 additional doses over a 5-week period. Consolidation therapy began 6 weeks \n(range, 3-8) after induction in the single institution study and 4 weeks (range, 3-6) in the multicentre \nstudy. CR was defined as the absence of visible leukaemic cells in the bone marrow and peripheral \nrecovery of platelets and white blood cells. \n \nPatients in the single centre study had relapsed following 1-6 prior therapy regimens and 2 patients \nhad relapsed following stem cell transplantation. Patients in the multicentre study had relapsed \nfollowing 1-4 prior therapy regimens and 5 patients had relapsed following stem cell transplantation. \nThe median age in the single centre study was 33 years (age range 9 to 75). The median age in the \nmulticentre study was 40 years (age range 5 to 73). \nThe results are summarised in the table 4 below. \n \nTable 4 \n Single centre study \n\nN = 12 \nMulticentre study \n\nN = 40 \nArsenic trioxide dose, \nmg/kg/day (median, range) \n\n0.16 (0.06 \u2013 0.20) 0.15 \n\nCR 11 (92 %) 34 (85 %) \nTime to bone marrow \nremission (median) \n\n32 days 35 days \n\nTime to CR (median) 54 days 59 days \n18-month survival 67 % 66 % \n \nThe single institution study included 2 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), both of whom achieved \nCR. The multicentre study included 5 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), 3 of whom achieved CR. No \nchildren of less than 5 years of age were treated. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIn a follow-up treatment after consolidation, 7 patients in the single institution study and 18 patients in \nthe multicentre study received further maintenance therapy with arsenic trioxide. Three patients from \nthe single institution study and 15 patients from the multicentre study had stem cell transplants after \ncompleting arsenic trioxide. The Kaplan-Meier median CR duration for the single institution study is \n14 months and has not been reached for the multicentre study. At last follow-up, 6 of 12 patients in the \nsingle institution study were alive with a median follow--up time of 28 months (range 25 to 29). In the \nmulticentre study 27 of 40 patients were alive with a median follow-up time of 16 months (range 9 \nto 25).

The response rate was \nsimilar for both genders. There is no experience on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the variant APL \ncontaining the t(11;17) and t(5;17) chromosomal translocations. \nPaediatric population \n \nThe experience in children is limited. Of 7 patients under 18 years of age (range 5 to 16 years) treated \nwith arsenic trioxide at the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 patients achieved a complete \nresponse (see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe inorganic, lyophilized form of arsenic trioxide, when placed into solution, immediately forms the \nhydrolysis product arsenious acid (AsIII). AsIII is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic \ntrioxide. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution (Vd) for AsIII is large (> 400 L) indicating significant distribution into the \ntissues with negligible protein binding. Vd is also weight dependent, increasing with increasing body \nweight. Total arsenic accumulates mainly in the liver, kidney, and heart and, to a lesser extent, in the \nlung, hair, and nails. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves oxidation of arsenious acid (AsIII), the active species of \narsenic trioxide, to arsenic acid (AsV), as well as oxidative methylation to monomethylarsonic acid \n(MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) by methyltransferases, primarily in the liver. The \npentavalent metabolites, MMAV and DMAV, are slow to appear in plasma (approximately 10-24 hours \nafter first administration of arsenic trioxide), but due to their longer half-life, accumulate more upon \nmultiple dosing than does AsIII. The extent of accumulation of these metabolites is dependent on the \ndosing regimen. Approximate accumulation ranged from 1.4- to 8-fold following multiple as \ncompared to single dose administration. AsV is present in plasma only at relatively low levels. \n \nIn vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes revealed that arsenic trioxide has no \ninhibitory activity on substrates of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, 4A9/11. Substances that are substrates for these P450 enzymes are not \nexpected to interact with Arsenic trioxide medac. \n \nElimination \n \nApproximately 15 % of the administered arsenic trioxide dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nAsIII. The methylated metabolites of AsIII (MMAV, DMAV) are primarily excreted in the urine. The \nplasma concentration of AsIII declines from peak plasma concentration in a biphasic manner with a \nmean terminal elimination half-life of 10 to 14 hours. The total clearance of AsIII over the single-dose \nrange of 7-32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg) is 49 L/h and the renal clearance is 9 L/h. Clearance is \nnot dependent on the weight of the subject or the dose administered over the dose range studied. The \nmean estimated terminal elimination half-lives of the metabolites MMAV and DMAV are 32 hours and \n70 hours, respectively. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPlasma clearance of AsIII was not altered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nof 50-80 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-49 mL/min). The plasma \nclearance of AsIII in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) \nwas 40 % lower when compared with patients with normal renal function (see section 4.4). \n \nSystemic exposure to MMAV and DMAV tended to be larger in patients with renal impairment; the \nclinical consequence of this is unknown but no increased toxicity was noted. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPharmacokinetic data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma having mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment indicate that AsIII or AsV do not accumulate following twice-weekly infusions. No clear \ntrend toward an increase in systemic exposure to AsIII, AsV, MMAV or DMAV was observed with \ndecreasing level of hepatic function as assessed by dose-normalised (per mg dose) area under the \ncurve (AUC). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn the total single dose range of 7 to 32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg), systemic exposure (AUC) \nappears to be linear. The decline from peak plasma concentration of AsIII occurs in a biphasic manner \nand is characterised by an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination \nphase. After administration at 0.15 mg/kg on a daily (n = 6) or twice-weekly (n = 3) regimen, an \napproximate 2-fold accumulation of AsIII was observed as compared to a single infusion. This \naccumulation was slightly more than expected based on single-dose results. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nLimited reproductive toxicity studies of arsenic trioxide in animals indicate embryotoxicity and \nteratogenicity (neural tube defects, anophthalmia and microphthalmia) at administration of 1-10 times \nthe recommended clinical dose (mg/m\u00b2). Fertility studies have not been conducted with Arsenic \ntrioxide medac. Arsenic compounds induce chromosomal aberrations and morphological \ntransformations of mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. No formal carcinogenicity studies of arsenic \ntrioxide have been performed. However, arsenic trioxide and other inorganic arsenic compounds are \nrecognised as human carcinogens. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Arsenic trioxide medac is and what it is used for \n \nArsenic trioxide medac contains the active substance arsenic trioxide which is an anticancer medicine. \nThe mechanism of action of Arsenic trioxide medac is not completely understood. \n \nArsenic trioxide medac is used in adult patients with newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute \npromyelocytic leukaemia (APL), and in adult patients, whose disease has not responded to other \ntherapies. APL is a unique type of myeloid leukaemia, a disease in which abnormal white blood cells \nand abnormal bleeding and bruising occur. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Arsenic trioxide medac \n \nPlease tell your doctor,pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou will not be given Arsenic trioxide medac \nIf you are allergic to arsenic trioxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nYou must talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Arsenic trioxide medac, if \n\u2022 you have impaired kidney function. \n\u2022 you have any liver problems. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nYour doctor will take the following precautions: \n\u2022 Tests will be performed to check the amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium and creatinine \n\nin your blood before your first dose of Arsenic trioxide medac. \n\u2022 You should have an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram, ECG) performed \n\nbefore your first dose. \n\u2022 Blood tests (potassium, calcium, liver function) should be repeated during your treatment with \n\nArsenic trioxide medac. \n\u2022 In addition, you will receive electrocardiograms twice weekly. \n\u2022 If you are at risk for a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. torsade de pointes or QTc \n\nprolongation), your heart will be monitored continuously. \n\u2022 Your doctor may monitor your health during and after treatment, since arsenic trioxide, the \n\nactive substance in Arsenic trioxide medac, may cause other cancers. You should report any \nnew and exceptional symptoms and circumstances whenever you see your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Follow-up of your cognitive and mobility functions if you are at risk for vitamin B1 deficiency. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nArsenic trioxide medac is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Arsenic trioxide medac \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIn particular tell your doctor or pharmacist \n\u2022 if you are taking any of various types of medicines which could cause a change in the rhythm of \n\nyour heartbeat. These include: \n- some types of antiarrhythmics (medicines used to correct irregular heart beats, e.g. \n\nquinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) \n- medicines to treat psychosis (loss of contact with reality, e.g. thioridazine) \n- medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline) \n- some types of medicines to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin and \n\nsparfloxacin) \n- some medicines to treat allergies such as hayfever, called antihistamines (e.g. \n\nterfenadine and astemizole) \n- any medicines that cause a decrease in magnesium or potassium in your blood (e.g. \n\namphotericin B) \n- cisapride (a medicine used to relieve certain stomach problems). \n\nThe effect of these medicines on your heartbeat can be made worse by Arsenic trioxide medac. \nYou must be sure to tell your doctor or pharmacist about all medicines you are taking. \n\n\u2022 if you are taking or have recently taken any medicine which may affect your liver. If you are not \nsure, show the bottle or pack to your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \nArsenic trioxide medac with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your food or drink while you are receiving Arsenic trioxide medac. \n \nPregnancy \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Arsenic trioxide medac may \ncause harm to the foetus when used by pregnant women. \nIf you are able to become pregnant, you must use effective birth control during treatment with Arsenic \ntrioxide medac. \nIf you are pregnant or you become pregnant during the treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac, you \nmust ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \nMen should also use effective contraception during treatment with Arsenic trioxide medac. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nBreast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. The arsenic in Arsenic trioxide \nmedac passes into breast milk. \nBecause Arsenic trioxide medac can harm breastfed children, do not breast-feed while on Arsenic \ntrioxide medac. \n \nDriving and using machines \nArsenic trioxide medac is expected to have no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use \nmachines. If you experience discomfort or if you feel unwell after an Arsenic trioxide medac injection, \nyou should wait until the symptoms go away before driving or using machines. \n \nArsenic trioxide medac contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How Arsenic trioxide medac is used \n \nArsenic trioxide medac must be given under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of acute leukaemias. \n \nDuration and frequency of treatment \n \nPatients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia \nYour doctor will give you Arsenic trioxide medac once every day as an infusion.
