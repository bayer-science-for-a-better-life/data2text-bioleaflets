This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZiextenzo 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim* in 0.6 mL solution for injection. The \nconcentration is 10 mg/mL based on protein only**. \n \n*Produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology followed by conjugation with \npolyethylene glycol (PEG). \n** The concentration is 20 mg/mL if the PEG moiety is included. \n \nThe potency of this product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or \nnon-pegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1 \n \nExcipients with known effect \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nClear, colourless to slightly yellowish solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \nand myelodysplastic syndromes). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZiextenzo therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \nhaematology. \n \nPosology \n \nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Ziextenzo is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, \ngiven at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in children has not yet been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nNo dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end stage renal \ndisease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nZiextenzo is for subcutaneous use. The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), the trade name \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nGeneral warnings and precautions \n \nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for \npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (see section 5.1). \nHowever, the long-term effects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in AML; therefore, it should \nbe used with caution in this patient population. \n \nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary AML; therefore, it should \nnot be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from AML. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with \ncytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens. \n \nPulmonary adverse events \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs \nof pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil count \nmay be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such circumstances \npegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate treatment \ngiven (see section 4.8). \n \nGlomerulonephritis \n \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. \nUrinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \n \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration \nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who \ndevelop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \n \nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal cases, \nhave been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, spleen size \nshould be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture \nshould be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. \n \nThrombocytopenia and anaemia \n \nTreatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full dose \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering single \nor combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. \n \nSickle cell anaemia \n \nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing \npegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicine with \nsplenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. \n \nLeukocytosis \n \nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 1% of patients \nreceiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been \nreported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after \nadministration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicine. Consistent with the \nclinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be performed at regular intervals \nduring therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/L after the expected nadir, this medicine should be \ndiscontinued immediately. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment has been \nreported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Permanently discontinue pegfilgrastim in patients with \nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer pegfilgrastim to patients with a history of \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nhypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy \nshould be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in \nassociation with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of pegfilgrastim, \ntreatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time.  \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \nantibodies against pegfilgrastim are generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n \nAortitis \n \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and inflammatory markers \n(e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count) were raised. In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. \n \nOther warnings \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or \nhealthy donors have not been adequately evaluated. \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results. \n \n \nThis medicinal product contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to \n50 mg / mL. The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) \nand dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a \npegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In \nclinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant \nuse of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models \nconcomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other antimetabolites has been \nshown to potentiate myelosuppression. \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been specifically \ninvestigated in clinical trials. \n \nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g. nitrosoureas. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not \nindicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pegfilgrastim is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim/metabolites in human milk, a risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from pegfilgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \nsurface area) (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPegfilgrastim has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [\u2265 1/10]) and \nmusculoskeletal pain (common [\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10]). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate \nseverity, transient and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics. \n \nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythaema, \nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon \n[\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100]). Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving \npegfilgrastim (uncommon) (see section 4.4). \n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following administration \nof granulocyte colony-stimulating factors; see section 4.4 and section \u201cDescription of selected adverse \nreactions\u201d below. \n \nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon. \n \nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4). \n \nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in \nrespiratory failure or ARDS, which may be fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nIsolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell \ndisease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting.

The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based upon 1,576 patients receiving pegfilgrastim in nine randomised clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nUncommon cases of Sweet\u2019s syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \nhaematological malignancies may play a role. \n \nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. The \nmechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions, including injection site erythaema (uncommon) as well as injection site pain \n(common) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim. \n \nCommon cases of leukocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] > 100 x 109/L) have been reported (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated clinical \neffects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, with no \nassociated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving pegfilgrastim following cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. \n \nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. \n \nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. \n \nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. \n \nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post-marketing setting with granulocyte \ncolony-stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger \nchildren aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and 12-21 years \nrespectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was bone pain (see \nsection 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy \nvolunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse \nevents were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code: L03AA13 \n \nZiextenzo is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nHuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production \nand release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of recombinant \nhuman G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. Pegfilgrastim \nis a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. \nPegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a marked \nincrease in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes \nand/or lymphocytes. Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to pegfilgrastim show \nnormal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. As with \nother haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human \nendothelial cells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and \nsimilar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer \nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of \n11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to \nresult in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile \nneutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration of \ngrade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the filgrastim \ngroup (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile neutropenia \nwas 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated patients (difference \n7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n = 310), which used a weight-adjusted dose (100 \u00b5g/kg), \nthe mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.7 days, compared with \n1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% CI-0.36, 0.30). The overall rate of febrile \nneutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 18% of patients treated with filgrastim \n(difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%, -1.1%). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy regimen \nassociated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles). \nNine hundred and twenty eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of pegfilgrastim \nor placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The incidence of febrile \nneutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared with placebo (1% \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nversus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use associated with a \nclinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group compared with placebo \n(1% versus 14%, p < 0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p < 0.001). \n \nA small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de \nnovo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, \nadministered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was \nestimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4). \n \nIn a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients receiving \n100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n(VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 109) was \nobserved in younger children aged 0-5 years (8.9 days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years and \n12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher incidence of febrile \nneutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (75%) compared to older children aged \n6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim occurs \nat 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained during the \nperiod of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of pegfilgrastim is \nnon-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increasing dose. \nPegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes \nsaturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum \nconcentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see Figure 1). \n \n\nFigure 1. Profile of median pegfilgrastim serum concentration and absolute neutrophil count \n(ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 6 mg injection \n\n \n \nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not \nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open-label, single dose study (n = 31) \nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nElderly \n \nLimited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \nsimilar to that in adults. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \nreceived 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest age \ngroup (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) \n(47.9 \u00b1 22.5 mcg\u00b7hr/ml) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 \u00b1 13.1 mcg hr/ml and \n29.3 \u00b1 23.2 mcg\u00b7hr/ml, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age group \n(0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with \nhigh-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of \ndoxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement. \n \nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nZiextenzo 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\npegfilgrastim \n \n\u25bcThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their symptoms of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ziextenzo is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Ziextenzo \n3. How to use Ziextenzo \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ziextenzo \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ziextenzo is and what it is used for \n \nZiextenzo contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. \n \nZiextenzo is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are important \nas they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy \nwhich can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells fall to a low \nlevel there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of \ninfection. \n \nYour doctor has given you Ziextenzo to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Ziextenzo \n \nDo not use Ziextenzo  \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ziextenzo: \n \n\u2022 if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \n\nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin \nthat itch. \n\n\u2022 if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS). \n\n\u2022 if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: \n- swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, \n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of \ntiredness \n\n These could be symptoms of condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood to \nleak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4. \n\n\u2022 if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a \nproblem with your spleen (splenomegaly). \n\n\u2022 if you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary \noedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung \ninfiltration). \n\n\u2022 if you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or \ndecreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. \n\n\u2022 if you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. \n\u2022 if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, \n\nlips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing these \ncould be signs of a severe allergic reaction. \n\n\u2022 Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \nbody) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include \nfever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor \nif you experience these symptoms. \n\n \nYour doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as pegfilgrastim can harm the tiny filters inside \nyour kidneys (glomerulonephritis). \n \nSevere skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Ziextenzo. Stop \nusing Ziextenzo and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in \nsection 4. \n \nYou should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or \nare likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Ziextenzo, unless instructed by your \ndoctor. \n \nLoss of response to pegfilgrastim \n \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, your \ndoctor will investigate the reasons why, including whether you have developed antibodies which \nneutralise pegfilgrastim\u2019s activity. \n \nOther medicines and Ziextenzo \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Pegfilgrastim has not been tested \nin pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\u2022 are pregnant; \n\u2022 think you may be pregnant; or \n\u2022 are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you become pregnant during Ziextenzo treatment, please inform your doctor.  \n \nUnless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Ziextenzo. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nZiextenzo has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nZiextenzo contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium \n \nThis medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filed syringe which is equivalent to 50 mg / mL. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Ziextenzo \n \nZiextenzo is for use in adults aged 18 and over. \n \nAlways use Ziextenzo exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are unsure. The usual dose is one 6 mg subcutaneous injection (injection under your \nskin) using a pre-filled syringe and it should be given at least 24 hours after your last dose of \nchemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. \n \nInjecting Ziextenzo yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Ziextenzo yourself. Your \ndoctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been \ntrained. \n \nFor further instructions on how to inject yourself with Ziextenzo, please read the section at the end of \nthis leaflet. \n \nDo not shake Ziextenzo vigorously as this may affect its activity. \n \nIf you use more Ziextenzo than you should \n \nIf you use more Ziextenzo than you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you forget to inject Ziextenzo \n \nIf you are injecting yourself and have forgotten a dose of Ziextenzo, you should contact your doctor to \ndiscuss when you should inject the next dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n4.

body. ziextenzo is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). white blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. these cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. if white blood cells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. your doctor has given you ziextenzo to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ziextenzo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 2, "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 9, "Score": 0.7836407423019409, "Text":

to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ziextenzo: if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin that itch. if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. this can be a sign of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: - swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness these could be symptoms of condition called \"capillary leak syndrome\" which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body. see section 4. if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. this may be a sign of a problem with your spleen (splenomegaly). if you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung infiltration). if you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. if you have sickle cell anaemia. your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. the symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as pegfilgrastim can harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis). severe skin reactions (stevens-johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of ziextenzo. stop using ziextenzo and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in section 4. you should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. if you develop or are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use ziextenzo, unless instructed by your doctor. loss of response to pegfilgrastim if you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why, including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise pegfilgrastim's activity. other medicines and ziextenzo tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. pegfilgrastim has not been tested in pregnant women. it is important to tell your doctor if you: are pregnant; think you may be pregnant; or are planning to have a baby. if you become pregnant during ziextenzo treatment, please inform your doctor. unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use ziextenzo. driving and using machines ziextenzo has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. ziextenzo contains sorbitol (e420) and sodium this medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filed syringe which is equivalent to 50 mg / ml. this medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially
