NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYTRACIS radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. \n \n \n2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of sterile solution contains 1.850 GBq Yttrium (90Y) chloride, at the date of calibration, \ncorresponding to 92 ng of Yttrium. \n \nOne vial contains 0.925 to 3.700 GBq (see section 6.5). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nRadiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. \n \nClear, colourless solution, free of particulate matter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTo be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed \nand authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. \n \nRadiopharmaceutical precursor - Not intended for direct application to patients. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nYTRACIS is only to be used by specialists with the appropriate experience. \n \nThe quantity of YTRACIS required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled \nmedicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product \nradiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of \nthe particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nYTRACIS is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products, which are subsequently \nadministered by approved route. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nDo not administer YTRACIS directly to the patient. \nYTRACIS is contraindicated in the following cases: \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6). \n \nFor information on contraindications to particular Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared \nby radiolabelling with YTRACIS, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of \nthe particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe content of the vial of YTRACIS is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used \nfor the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other \nsubstrates. \n \nRadioactive medicinal products should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons \nin designated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and appropriate licences of the competent authorities. \n \nRadioactive medicinal products should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both \nradiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. \n \nFor information concerning special warnings and precautions for use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled \nmedicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. \n \nParticular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and \nadolescents.  \n\n \n4.5  Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nFor information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal \nproducts refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled. \n\n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nYTRACIS is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not \nbeen excluded (see section 4.3 Contraindications). \n\n \nWhen it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of childbearing potential, \ninformation should always be sought about pregnancy. Any woman who has missed a period should \nbe assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. Alternative techniques which do not involve \nionising radiation should always be considered. \n \nRadionuclide procedures carried out in pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus. \nThe absorbed dose to the uterus following administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal \nproducts is dependent on the specific medicinal product being radiolabelled and is to be specified in \nthe Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nBefore administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration \nshould be given to whether the administration could be reasonably delayed until the mother has \nceased breastfeeding. If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be advised to \nstop breastfeeding. \n \nFor information concerning the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy and \nlactation refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive or use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nEffects on ability to drive or use machines following treatment by Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal \nproducts will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n\n \n4.8  Undesirable Effects \n \nPossible side effects following the intravenous administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal \nproducts prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS, will be dependent on the specific medicinal \nproduct being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. For each patient, \nexposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The activity \nadministered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing \nin mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result. \n \nThe radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and \nmutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the \ndisease itself. \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe presence of free Yttrium (90Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Ytracis \nwill lead to increase bone marrow toxicity and haematopoetic stem cell damage. Therefore, in case of \nan inadvertent administration of Ytracis, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by \nimmediate (i.e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or \nCa- EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. \n \nThe following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Ytracis for \nradiolabelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: \n Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or \n Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)  \n \nThese chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the \nyttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, \nEDTA). These complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.  \n \n1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over \n3-4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100-250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline).  \n \nThe chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide \nis circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval >1 hour \ndoes not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. \nIntravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions \nimmediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow.  \n \nThe toxicity of the free Yttrium (90Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body \nduring therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Not applicable \nATC code: Not applicable \n \nYttrium (90Y) chloride is produced by decay of its radioactive precursor Strontium (90Sr). It decays by \nemission of beta radiation of 2.281 MeV (99.98 %) of maximal energy to stable Zirconium (90Zr). \n90Y-yttrium has a half-life of 2.67 days (64.1 hours). \n \nThe pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with YTRACIS, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package \nleaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with YTRACIS, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nIn the rat, following intravenous administration, Yttrium (90Y) chloride is rapidly cleared from the \nblood. At 1 and 24 hours, blood radioactivity decreases from 11 % to 0.14 % of the administered \nactivity. The two main organs where Yttrium (90Y) chloride distributes are the liver and bones. In the \nliver, 18 % of the injected activity is taken up 5 min after injection. Liver uptake decreases then to \n8.4 % 24 hours after injection. In bone, percentage of injected activity increases from 3.1 % at 5 min \nto 18 % at 6 hours and then decreases with time. Faecal and urinary elimination is slow: about 13 % \nof the administered activity is eliminated in 15 days. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling \nwith YTRACIS prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nThere are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium (90Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction \nin animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1  List of excipients \n \nHydrochloric acid 30 % \nWater for injections \n \n6.2  Incompatibilities \n \nRadiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, with \nYttrium (90Y) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. \nIt is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the radiolabelled \nmedicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only \nsyringe needles (for example non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to \nminimise trace metal impurity levels. \n \n6.3  Shelf life  \n \n7 days from the date/hour of manufacture. \n \n6.4  Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in the original package. \n \nStorage should be in accordance with local regulations for radioactive substances. \n \n6.5  Nature and contents of container \n \nColourless Type I glass 2-ml vial, closed with Teflon-coated bromobutyl rubber stopper and \naluminium overseal. \n \n1 vial contains 0.5 to 2 ml (corresponding to 0.925 to 3.700 GBq calibrated three or four days after the \nmanufacturing date) depending on the ordered radioactivity. \n \nThe vial is supplied in a lead pot of appropriate thickness. \n \n6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe administration of radioactive medicinal products creates risks for other persons from external \nradiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in \naccordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nSee section 12, for detailed instructions of product preparation. \n \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n7.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nBefore use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an \nionisation chamber. Yttrium (90Y) is a beta pure emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation \nchamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under \ngeometric conditions which have been appropriately validated. \nUsual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected. \n \nThe vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. See section 4. \n \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What YTRACIS is and what it is used for  \n2. Before you use YTRACIS \n3. How to use YTRACIS \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store YTRACIS \n6. Further information \n \n \n \n1. WHAT YTRACIS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  \n \nYTRACIS is a radioactive medicine used in combination with another medicine product which targets \nspecific body cells. When the target is reached, Ytracis gives tiny radiation doses to these specific \nsites. \n \nFor further information regarding the treatment and possible effects caused by the medicinal product \nto be radiolabelled please refer to the package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE YTRACIS \n \nDo not use YTRACIS: \n- if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or any of the other ingredients of \nYTRACIS. \n- if you are pregnant or if there is a possibility that you might be pregnant (see below). \n \nTake special care with YTRACIS: \nYTRACIS is not to be administered directly to the patient. \n \nBecause there are strict laws covering the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity, YTRACIS will \nalways be used in a hospital or a similar setting. It will only be handled and administered by people \nwho are trained and qualified in the safe handling of radioactive material. \n \nParticular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and \nadolescents. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nPregnancy: \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nIt is important to tell your doctor if there is any possibility that you are pregnant. Any woman who has \nmissed a period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. Alternative techniques \nwhich do not involve radioactive medicines should always be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding: \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nYou will be asked to stop breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines: \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nTaking other medicines: \nNo interactions of Yttrium (90Y) chloride with other medicinal products are known because no studies \nhave investigated this issue. \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE YTRACIS \n \nYTRACIS is not to be administered directly to the patient. \n \nDosage \nYour physician will decide on the amount of YTRACIS to be used in your case.  \n \nMethod of Administration \nYTRACIS is intended for radiolabelling of medicinal products to treat specific diseases, which are \nsubsequently administered by approved route. \n \nIf you use more YTRACIS than you should \nSince YTRACIS is administered by a doctor under strictly controlled conditions there is little chance \nof possible overdose. However, should this occur, you will receive appropriate treatment from your \ndoctor.  \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, YTRACIS can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nFor more information, refer to the package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n5. HOW TO STORE  YTRACIS \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \nDo not use after the expiry date and time stated on the label. \nStore in the original package. \nStore in accordance with local regulations for radioactive substances. \n \nThe product label includes the appropriate storage conditions and the expiry date for the batch of \nproduct. Hospital personnel will ensure that the product is stored correctly and not administered to \nyou after the stated expiry date.  \n \n \n6. FURTHER INFORMATION \n \nWhat YTRACIS contains \n \n- The active substance is Yttrium (90Y) chloride. \n\nEach millilitre of solution contains 1.850 GBq of Yttrium (90Y) chloride at the date of \ncalibration.(GBq : GigaBecquerel, Becquerel is the unit in which radioactivity is measured).  \n\n- The other ingredients are hydrochloric acid and water for injections. \n \nWhat YTRACIS looks like and contents of the pack \n \nYTRACIS is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. \n \nThis medicine is a clear and colourless solution which is packed in a colourless Type I glass 2-ml vial \nclosed with Teflon-coated bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium overseal. \n \nA vial contains 0.5 ml (0.925 GBq at calibration) to 2 ml (3.700 GBq at calibration). \n \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nCIS bio international \nBoîte Postale 32 \nF-91192 Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex \nFRANCE \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in (). \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site:  \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n \n \nThe following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: \nFor detailed information refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of YTRACIS. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
