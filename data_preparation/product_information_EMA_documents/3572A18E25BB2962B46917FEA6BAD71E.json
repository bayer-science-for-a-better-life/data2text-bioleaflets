This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIdefirix 11 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 11 mg imlifidase produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nAfter reconstitution and dilution, each mL of concentrate contains 10 mg imlifidase.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nThe powder is a white cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIdefirix is indicated for desensitisation treatment of highly sensitised adult kidney transplant patients \nwith positive crossmatch against an available deceased donor. The use of Idefirix should be reserved \nfor patients unlikely to be transplanted under the available kidney allocation system including \nprioritisation programmes for highly sensitised patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be prescribed and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of immunosuppressive therapy and of sensitised renal transplant patients.  \n \nImlifidase is restricted to hospital use only. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose is based on patient body weight (kg). The recommended dose is 0.25 mg/kg administered as \na single dose preferably within 24 hours before transplantation. One dose is adequate for crossmatch \nconversion in the majority of patients but if needed a second dose can be administered within 24 hours \nafter the first dose.  \n \nAfter treatment with imlifidase, crossmatch conversion from positive to negative should be confirmed \nbefore transplantation (see section 4.4). \n \nPremedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines should be given to reduce the risk of infusion \nreactions in accordance with transplant centre routines.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSince respiratory tract infections are the most common infections in patients with \nhypogammaglobulinemia, prophylactic oral antibiotics covering respiratory tract pathogens should be \nadded to the standard of care for 4 weeks (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients treated with imlifidase should, in addition, receive standard of care induction T-cell depleting \nagents with or without B-cell depleting agents (see section 5.1), i.e. imlifidase does not eliminate the \nneed for standard of care immunosuppressive therapy.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nData on the use in patients older than 65 years are limited, but there is no evidence to suggest that dose \nadjustment is required in these patients.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of imlifidase in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment have not \nbeen established. No data are available.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of imlifidase in children and adolescents 0 to 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIdefirix is for intravenous use only following reconstitution and dilution. \n \nThe entire, fully diluted infusion should be administered over a period of 15 minutes and must be \nadministered with an infusion set and a sterile, inline, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore \nsize of 0.2 μm). Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line is flushed with \ninfusion fluid to ensure administration of the complete dose. Do not store any unused portion of the \nsolution for infusion for re-use. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Ongoing serious infection. \n- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Patients with this blood disorder may be at risk \n\nof developing serum sickness.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions have been reported with imlifidase administration in clinical studies (see \nsection 4.8). If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, imlifidase therapy should be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Mild or moderate infusion-related \nreactions occurring during imlifidase treatment can be managed by temporarily interrupting the \ninfusion, and/or by administration of medicinal products, such as antihistamines, antipyretics and \ncorticosteroids. An interrupted infusion can be restarted when the symptoms have abated. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nInfection and infection prophylaxis \n \nFor kidney transplantation, ongoing serious infections of any origin (bacterial, viral or fungal) are \nconsidered a contraindication, and chronic infections such as HBV or HIV have to be well controlled. \nThe temporary reduction of IgG by imlifidase must be taken into consideration. The most common \ninfections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are respiratory tract infections. Therefore, in \naddition to the standard of care infection prophylaxis in kidney transplantation in general (against \nPneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus and oral candida), all patients should also receive prophylactic \noral antibiotics covering respiratory tract pathogens for 4 weeks. Should a patient for any reason not \nbe transplanted after imlifidase treatment, prophylactic oral antibiotics covering respiratory tract \npathogens should still be given for 4 weeks.   \n \nUse of imlifidase and T-cell depleting induction therapy with or without memory B-cell depleting \ntherapies may increase the risk of reactivation of live-attenuated vaccines and/or latent tuberculosis.   \n \nVaccinations \n \nDue to the reduced IgG levels after treatment with imlifidase, there is a risk for a temporary reduction \nof vaccine protection for up to 4 weeks following imlifidase treatment.   \n \nAntibody-mediated rejection (AMR)  \n \nAMR may occur as a consequence of rebound of donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Patients with very \nhigh levels of DSA before transplantation are more likely to experience early AMR that requires \nintervention. Most patients in the clinical studies had rebound of DSA that peaked between 7 and \n21 days after imlifidase treatment, and AMR occurred in approximately 30% of the patients. All \npatients with AMR in clinical studies were successfully managed with standard of care treatment. The \nre-appearance of DSAs and increased risk of AMR in highly sensitised patients require physician’s \nprevious experience from managing sensitised patients, resources and preparedness to diagnose and \ntreat acute AMRs according to standard clinical practice. Management of patients should include close \nmonitoring of HLA antibodies and serum or plasma creatinine as well as readiness to perform biopsies \nwhen AMR is suspected.   \n \nPatients with positive T-cell complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch test \n \nThere is very limited experience in patients with a confirmed positive T-cell CDC-crossmatch test \nbefore imlifidase treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nThe potential influence of anti-imlifidase antibodies (ADA) on the efficacy and safety of a second \nimlifidase dose given within 24 hours of the first is expected to be negligible, since the production of \nADA in response to the first dose has not yet started to develop. \n \nConfirmation of crossmatch conversion  \n \nEach clinic should follow its standard protocol for confirmation of crossmatch conversion from \npositive to negative. If complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch (CDCXM) is used, the \nfollowing needs to be considered to avoid false positive results: IgM has to be inactivated to be able to \nspecifically assess the cytotoxic capacity of IgG. The use of an anti-human globulin (AHG) step \nshould be avoided. If used, it should be confirmed that the AHG is directed against the Fc-part and not \nagainst the Fab-part of the IgG. Use of AHG, directed against the Fab-part, will not allow correct \nreadout of a CDCXM in an imlifidase-treated patient.    \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAntibody-based medicinal products \n \nImlifidase is a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves IgG. As a consequence, IgG-based medicinal \nproducts may be inactivated if given in connection with imlifidase. Antibody-based medicinal \nproducts cleaved by imlifidase include, but are not limited to basiliximab, rituximab, alemtuzumab, \nadalimumab, denosumab, belatacept, etanercept, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) and \nintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (see section 4.5 for recommended time intervals between \nadministration of imlifidase and antibody-based medicinal products). \n \nIVIg may contain neutralising antibodies against imlifidase, which may inactivate imlifidase if IVIg is \ngiven before imlifidase (see section 4.5).  \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nImlifidase specifically cleaves IgG; the species specificity results in degradation of all subclasses of \nhuman and rabbit IgG. As a consequence, medicinal products based on human or rabbit IgG may be \ninactivated if given in connection with imlifidase. Antibody-based medicinal products cleaved by \nimlifidase include, but are not limited to basiliximab, rituximab, alemtuzumab, adalimumab, \ndenosumab, belatacept, etanercept, rATG and IVIg.  \n \nImlifidase does not degrade equine anti-thymocyte globulin and no time interval between \nadministrations needs to be considered. Eculizumab is not cleaved by imlifidase at the recommended \ndose level. \n \nTable 1 Recommended time intervals for administration of antibody-based medicinal \n products after administration of imlifidase  \n\nMedicinal product  Recommended time interval after administration of \n0.25 mg/kg imlifidase \n\nequine anti-thymocyte globulin, \neculizumab \n\nNo time interval needed (can be administered \nconcomitantly with imlifidase) \n\nintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 12 hours \nalemtuzumab, adalimumab, \nbasiliximab, denosumab, etanercept, \nrituximab \n\n4 days \n\nrabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin \n(rATG), belatacept \n\n1 week \n\n \nAlso, IVIg may contain neutralising antibodies against imlifidase, which may inactivate imlifidase if \nIVIg is given before imlifidase. The half-life of IVIg (3-4 weeks) should be considered before \nimlifidase administration to patients treated with IVIg. In clinical studies, IVIg was not administered \nwithin 4 weeks before imlifidase infusion. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from use of imlifidase in pregnant women since pregnancy is a contraindication to \nkidney transplantation.  \nStudies in rabbits do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of imlifidase with respect to \nembryonic/foetal development (see section 5.3).  \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of imlifidase during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether imlifidase is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be \nexcluded.  \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued before imlifidase exposure.  \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies on fertility and postnatal development have been conducted (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common serious adverse reactions in clinical studies were pneumonia (5.6%) and sepsis \n(3.7%). The most common adverse reactions were infections (16.7%) (including pneumonia (5.6%), \nurinary tract infection (5.6%) and sepsis (3.7%)), infusion site pain (3.7%), infusion related reactions \n(3.7%), alanine aminotransferase increased (3.7%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (3.7%), \nmyalgia (3.7%), headache (3.7%) and flushing (3.7%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions described in this section were identified in the clinical studies (N=54). \nThe adverse reactions are presented according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. The frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nTable 2  Adverse reactions  \n\nMedDRA system organ class Adverse reaction/ \nFrequency \n\n Very common Common  \nInfections and infestations Bacterial and viral \n\ninfection \nAbdominal infection \nAdenovirus infection  \nCatheter site infection  \nInfection \nInfluenza \nParvovirus infection \nPneumonia \nPostoperative wound infection \nSepsis \nUpper respiratory tract infection \nUrinary tract infection \nWound infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Anaemia \n\nImmune system disorders Transplant rejection \nNervous system disorders  Dizziness postural \n\nHeadache \nEye disorders  Scleral haemorrhage \n\nVisual impairment \nCardiac disorders  Sinus tachycardia \nVascular disorders  Flushing \n\nHypertension \nHypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n Dyspnoea \n\nSkin and subcutanous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Feeling hot \nInfusion site pain \n\nInvestigations  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \nincreased \nAspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) increased \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\n Infusion related reactions \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nIn the clinical studies, 16.7% of the patients experienced an infection. Nine infections were serious and \nassessed as related to imlifidase in the clinical studies, whereof 5 started within 30 days after \nimlifidase treatment. Eight of the 9 related serious infections had a duration of less than 30 days. The \nincidence and pattern (including infectious agent) of serious or severe infections were not different \nfrom those observed in kidney-transplanted patients in general (see section 4.4).  \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions, including dyspnoea and flushing were reported in 5.6% of the patients, one \nresulting in interruption of the imlifidase infusion and the patient not being transplanted. Except for \n\n\n\n8 \n\none event of mild rash, all infusion-related reactions started on the day of imlifidase infusion and \nresolved within 90 minutes (see section 4.4). \n   \nMyalgia \nMyalgia was reported for 2 patients (3.7%) in the clinical studies. One of the patients had severe \nmyalgia without any findings of muscle damage. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with doses higher than the recommended. In the event of an overdose, the \npatient should be monitored closely and treated symptomatically. \nNo specific antidote exists, but depletion of IgG can be restored by administration of IVIg.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA41. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nImlifidase is a cysteine protease derived from the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-degrading enzyme of \nStreptococcus pyogenes that cleaves the heavy chains of all human IgG subclasses but no other \nimmunoglobulins. The cleavage of IgG leads to elimination of Fc-dependent effector functions, \nincluding CDC and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). By cleaving all IgG, \nimlifidase reduces the level of DSA, thus enabling transplantation.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that IgG was cleaved within a few hours after administration of \nimlifidase 0.25 mg/kg. No early increase in plasma IgG due to reflux of uncleaved IgG from the \nextravascular compartment has been observed, indicating that imlifidase cleaves not only the plasma \nIgG but the entire IgG pool, including the extravascular IgG. The return of endogenous IgG starts \n1-2 weeks after imlifidase administration and continues over the next weeks. \n \nIt should be noted that turbidimetry/nephelometry methods, commonly used at hospitals for total IgG \nmeasurements, do not discriminate between different IgG fragments generated after imlifidase \ntreatment, and can therefore not be used to evaluate treatment effect.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThree open-label, single-arm, 6-months, clinical studies evaluated the dosing regimen, efficacy, and \nsafety of imlifidase as pre-transplant treatment to reduce donor-specific IgG and enable highly \nsensitised transplant candidates to be eligible for kidney transplantation. 46 patients between 20 and \n73 years of age were transplanted, all diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and on dialysis, \n21 (46%) women and 25 (54%) men. All patients were sensitised, 41 (89%) were highly sensitised \n(cPRA ≥ 80%), 33 (72%) of whom had a cPRA ≥ 95%. All patients that were crossmatch-positive \nbefore treatment with imlifidase were converted to negative within 24 hours. PKPD modelling showed \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nthat at 2 hours after administration of 0.25 mg/kg imlifidase, a crossmatch test is likely to become \nnegative in 96% of the patients, and after 6 hours at least 99.5% of the patients are likely to become \ncrossmatch test negative. All 46 patients were alive at 6 months with a kidney graft survival of 93%. \nKidney function was restored to the expected range for kidney-transplanted patients with 90% of the \npatients having an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 6 months.  \n \nStudy 03 evaluated safety and efficacy of imlifidase at different dosing regimens before kidney \ntransplantation in patients with ESRD. Ten patients were treated with a single dose of 0.25 (n=5) or \n0.5 (n=5) mg/kg imlifidase and transplanted. Seven patients were DSA-positive and 6 patients had a \npositive crossmatch before imlifidase treatment. DSA was reduced in all 7 patients and all positive \ncrossmatches were converted to negative after treatment. All 10 patients were successfully \ntransplanted and had a functioning kidney at 6 months. Eight of the 10 patients had an eGFR \n>30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients received immunosuppressive treatment including corticosteroids, \ncalcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil, and IVIg. Three patients experienced AMR during the \nstudy, none leading to graft loss. \n \nStudy 04 evaluated efficacy and safety of imlifidase in highly HLA-sensitised patients. 17 patients \nwere included and treated with a single dose of 0.24 mg/kg. 15 (88%) patients were DSA-positive and \n14 (82%) patients had a positive crossmatch before imlifidase treatment. DSA was reduced to levels \nacceptable for transplantation in all patients, and all patients were transplanted within few hours after \nimlifidase treatment. 16 of the 17 patients had a functioning kidney at 6 months with 15 (94%) patients \nhaving an eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Two patients experienced AMR, none leading to graft loss. \nPatients received immunosuppressive treatment including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitor, \nmycophenolate mofetil, alemtuzumab, and IVIg. \n \nStudy 06 evaluated the efficacy and safety of imlifidase in removing DSAs and converting a positive \ncrossmatch to negative in highly sensitised patients, thus, enabling transplantation. All patients \nincluded were on the kidney transplant waiting-list and had positive crossmatch to their available \ndonor before study inclusion (including 2 patients with a confirmed positive T-cell CDC-crossmatch \ntest). 18 patients received the full dose of 0.25 mg/kg imlifidase, 3 of whom received 2 doses \n12-13 hours apart, which resulted in cleavage of IgG and conversion of a positive crossmatch to \nnegative in all patients. 57% of the analysed patients were crossmatch-converted within 2 hours, and \n82% within 6 hours. All patients were successfully transplanted and 16 (89%) had a functioning \nkidney at 6-months (including the 2 patients with a confirmed positive T-cell CDC-crossmatch test). \n15 (94%) patients had an eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients received immunosuppressive treatment \nincluding corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, IVIg and \nalemtuzumab or equine anti-thymocyte globulin. Seven patients experienced active AMR, and another \npatient had subclinical AMR, none leading to graft loss.  \n \nElderly \n \nThree patients aged 65 years and older have received imlifidase before kidney transplantation in \nclinical studies. The safety and efficacy outcomes for these patients were consistent with the overall \nstudy population as assessed by patient and graft survival, renal function, and acute rejection. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nimlifidase in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in renal transplantation (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.  \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of imlifidase were comparable in healthy subjects and patients with ESRD. The \nexposure to imlifidase increased proportionally after a single intravenous 15-minute infusion of 0.12 to \n0.50 mg/kg body weight.   \nThe maximum concentration (Cmax) of imlifidase was observed at or soon after the end of the infusion, \nwith a mean of 5.8 (4.2-8.9) µg/mL after a dose of 0.25 mg/kg. The elimination of imlifidase was \ncharacterised by an initial distribution phase with a mean half-life of 1.8 (0.6-3.6) hours and a slower \nelimination phase with a mean half-life of 89 (60-238) hours. The mean clearance (CL) was \n1.8 (0.6-7.9) mL/h/kg and the distribution volume (Vz) was 0.20 (0.06-0.55) L/kg during the \nelimination phase. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits \nand dogs, and an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits. Due to the rapid and extensive \ndevelopment of anti-imlifidase antibodies and associated toxicity after repeated administrations, a \nstudy on fertility and early embryonic development has not been feasible. No toxicity to the \nreproductive organs was observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies but the potential effect of imlifidase \non male and female reproductive organs has not been fully addressed. No studies on pre- or postnatal \ntoxicity have been conducted. No genotoxicity studies were performed since the active substance is a \nprotein and is unlikely to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nIdefirix 11 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nimlifidase \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Idefirix is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Idefirix  \n3. How to use Idefirix \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Idefirix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Idefirix is and what it is used for \n \nIdefirix contains the active substance imlifidase, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nimmunosuppressants. It is given before your kidney transplantation to prevent the immune system \n(your body's defences) from rejecting the donated kidney. \n \nIdefirix works by breaking down a type of antibody in the body called immunoglobulin G (IgG), \nwhich is involved in destroying 'foreign' or harmful substances. \n \nImlifidase is a protein from a bacterium called Streptococcus pyogenes. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Idefirix  \n \nYou must not be given Idefirix \n- If you are allergic to imlifidase or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have a severe infection. \n- If you have a blood disorder called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), that results in \n\nblood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nInfusion reactions \nIdefirix contains a protein and it can cause allergic reactions in some people. You will receive \nmedicines to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. If you get any symptoms of an allergic reaction, \nsuch as severe rash, shortness of breath, feeling hot, flushing, during the infusion (‘drip’), the infusion \nmay need to be slowed down or stopped. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can \nbe continued. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nInfections \nIgG is important for protecting you against infections and since Idefirix breaks down IgG, you will \nreceive antibiotics to reduce the risk of infections. \n \nAntibody-mediated rejection (AMR)  \nYour body will produce new IgG antibodies, which may attack the transplanted kidney. Your doctor \nwill monitor you closely and you will receive medicines to reduce the risk of rejection. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been \nstudied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Idefirix \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Idefirix can \naffect the way some medicines work, and the dose of these may have to be adjusted.  \n \nAs Idefirix breaks down IgG, IgG-based medicines may not work if given at the same time as Idefirix. \nThis includes the following medicines:  \n- basiliximab (used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants) \n- rituximab (used to treat cancers such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic \n\nleukaemia and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis) \n- alemtuzumab (used to treat a form of multiple sclerosis) \n- adalimumab (used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) \n- denosumab (used to treat osteoporosis) \n- belatacept (used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants) \n- etanercept (used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \n\nankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis) \n- rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) (used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants) \n- intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (used to increase abnormally low immuniglobulin levels in \n\nthe blood or to treat inflammatory diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, Kawasaki disease \nand chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIdefirix is not recommended during pregnancy. \nTalk to your doctor if you think you may be pregnant. \n \nIt is not known whether Idefirix passes into breast milk. You should not breast-feed if you are being \ntreated with Idefirix. \n \nIdefirix contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n′sodium-free′. \n \n \n3. How to use Idefirix \n \nIdefirix will be prescribed by a doctor with experience in kidney transplantation and it is for use in a \nhospital. The medicine will be given by infusion into your vein over about 15 minutes.  \n \nA healthcare professional will calculate the right dose for you based on your weight. Idefirix is usually \ngiven as a single dose, but your doctor may decide to give a second dose before the transplantation.  \n \nInformation for healthcare professionals on dose calculation, preparation and infusion of Idefirix is \ngiven at the end of this leaflet. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIf you receive more Idefirix than you should \nDuring and after the infusion you will be closely monitored. Healthcare professionals will check for \nany side effects. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following: \n- Signs of infection, such as fever, chills, cough, feeling weak or generally unwell (very common \n\n- may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \n- Signs of an infusion reaction, such as severe rash, shortness of breath, feeling hot, flushing \n\n(common - may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  \n- Muscle pain or fatigue (symptoms of myalgia) (common - may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Infections: lung infection (pneumonia), infections of the blood (sepsis), abdominal infection, \n\nupper respiratory tract infection, adenovirus infection, parvovirus infection, urinary tract \ninfection, influenza, wound infection, post-operative wound infection, catheter site infection \n\n- Transplant rejection (IgG antibodies will try to reject your donor kidney and you can feel \ngeneral discomfort) \n\n- High or low blood pressure (symptoms of low blood pressure can be dizziness and symptoms of \nhigh blood pressure can be headache)  \n\n- Low number of red blood cells (anaemia) \n- Dizziness at change of body position, e.g. when standing up \n- Headache \n- Burst blood vessel in the eye \n- Decreased vision \n- Increased heart rate \n- Infusion site pain \n- Increased liver enzymes (seen in blood tests) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Idefirix \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Idefirix is stored in the hospital pharmacy. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the vial label and carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2-8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect from \nlight.  \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability after reconsitution and dilution has been demonstrated for \n24 hours at 2-8°C and for 4 hours at 25°C during this period. \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice particulate matter or discoloration after reconstitution. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater.

Invert the infusion bag several times \nto thoroughly mix the solution. The infusion bag should be protected from light. \n \nPrior to use the solution for infusion should be inspected visually for particulate matter or \ndiscolouration. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed.  \n \nAdministration  \nThe entire, fully diluted infusion should be infused over 15 minutes through an infusion set and a \nsterile, inline, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size of 0.2 μm). At the end of the \ninfusion, flushing the intravenous line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion will \nensure that the patient receives the full dose. Do not store any unused infusion solution for use later.  \n  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnex IV \n \n\nConclusions on the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation presented by the \nEuropean Medicines Agency \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on: \n\n• Conditional marketing authorisation \n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \nfavourable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as further \nexplained in the European Public Assessment Report. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
