HEMANGIOL is to be given during or right after a feed to avoid the risk of hypoglycaemia. \nIf the child is not eating or is vomiting it is recommended to skip the dose.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIn case the child spits up a dose or does not take all of the medicinal product no other dose should be \ngiven before the next scheduled dose. \n \nDuring the titration phase, each dose increase must be managed and monitored by a physician in the \nsame conditions as the administration of the initial dose. After the titration phase, the dose will be \nreadjusted by the physician according to the changes in the child’s weight.  \n \nClinical monitoring of the child condition, and dose readjustment, need to be performed at least \nmonthly. \n \nDuration of treatment: \nHEMANGIOL should be administered for a 6-month period.  \nDiscontinuation of treatment does not require a progressive decrease in the dose. \nIn the minority of patients showing a relapse of symptoms after treatment discontinuation, treatment \nmay be re-initiated under the same conditions with a satisfactory response. \n \nPaediatric populations \nIn the absence of clinical efficacy and safety data, HEMANGIOL should not be used in infants aged \nbelow 5 weeks. \nThere is no clinical efficacy and safety data in the clinical studies carried out with HEMANGIOL to \nrecommend its initiation in infants and children aged above 5 months. \n \nInfants with hepatic or renal impairment  \nIn the absence of data, administration of the medicinal product is not recommended to infants with \nhepatic or renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration  \nOral use. \nHEMANGIOL should be administered directly into the child's mouth using the graduated oral syringe, \ncalibrated in mg of propranolol base, supplied with the oral solution bottle (see instructions for use in \nsection 3 of the patient information leaflet). \nThe bottle should not be shaken before use. \nIf necessary, the medicinal product may be diluted in a small quantity of baby-milk or age-adapted \napple and/or orange fruit juice. The medicine should not be put in the full filled bottle. \nThe mixing may be done with one teaspoonful (approximately 5 mL) of milk for children weighing up \nto 5 kg, or with a tablespoonful (approximately 15 mL) of milk or fruit juice for children weighing \nmore than 5 kg, delivered in a baby’s bottle. The mixing should be used within 2 hours. \nHEMANGIOL and the feed must be given by the same person in order to avoid the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. If different people are involved, good communication is essential in order to ensure \nthe safety of the child. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Premature infants, for whom the corrected age of 5 weeks has not been reached (the corrected \n\nage being calculated by subtracting the number of weeks of prematurity from the actual age) \n• Breastfed infants, if the mother is treated with medicinal products contraindicated with \n\npropranolol  \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1  \n• Asthma or history of bronchospasm \n• Second- or third-degree atrioventricular blocks \n• Disease of the sinus node (including sinoatrial block) \n• Bradycardia below the following limits: \nAge 0-3 months 3-6 months 6-12 months \nHeart rate (beats/min) 100 90 80 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n• Low blood pressure below the following limits: \nAge 0-3 months 3-6 months 6-12 months \nBlood pressure (mmHg) 65/45 70/50 80/55 \n \n• Cardiogenic shock \n• Heart failure not controlled by treatment \n• Prinzmetal’s angina \n• Severe peripheral arterial circulatory disturbances (Raynaud’s phenomenon) \n• Infants prone to hypoglycaemia  \n• Phaeochromocytoma \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInitiation of treatment \nPrior to initiating propranolol therapy, screening for risks associated with propranolol use must be \nperformed. An analysis of the medical history and a full clinical examination must be performed \nincluding heart rate, cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. \nIn case of suspected cardiac abnormality, a specialist advice must be sought before treatment initiation \nto determine any subjacent contra-indication.  \nIn case of acute broncho-pulmonary abnormality, the initiation of the treatment should be postponed. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \nPropranolol, due to its pharmacological action, may cause or worsen bradycardia or blood pressure \nabnormalities. Bradycardia should be diagnosed if the heart rate declines by more than 30 bpm from \nbaseline. Bradycardia is defined below the following limits: \nAge 0-3 months 3-6 months 6-12 months \nHeart rate (beats/min) 100 90 80 \n \nAfter the first intake and each dose increase, a clinical monitoring, including blood pressure and heart \nrate must be performed at least hourly for at least 2 hours. In case of symptomatic bradycardia or \nbradycardia under 80 bpm, immediate specialist advice must be sought. \nIn case of severe and/or symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension occurring at any time during \ntreatment, treatment must be discontinued and a specialist advice should be sought. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPropranolol prevents the response of endogenous catecholamines to correct hypoglycaemia. It masks \nthe adrenergic warning signs of hypoglycaemia, particularly tachycardia, shakiness, anxiety and \nhunger. It can aggravate hypoglycaemia in children, especially in case of fasting, vomiting or \noverdose. \nThese hypoglycaemic episodes associated with the taking of propranolol may present exceptionally in \nthe form of seizures and/or coma. \nIf clinical signs of hypoglycaemia occur, it is necessary to make the child drink a sugary liquid \nsolution and to temporarily stop the treatment. Appropriate monitoring of the child is required until \nsymptoms disappear. \nIn children with diabetes, blood glucose monitoring should be more frequent and followed by the \nendocrinologist. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nIn the event of lower respiratory tract infection associated with dyspnoea and wheezing, treatment \nshould be temporarily discontinued. The administration of beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is \npossible. The readministration of propranolol may be considered when the child has fully recovered; \nin case of reoccurrence, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \nIn the event of isolated bronchospasm, treatment must be permanently discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCardiac failure:  \nSympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with \ncongestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In \nchildren with cardiac failure, the treatment should be managed by the cardiologist. \n \nPHACE syndrome \nVery limited safety data of propranolol in PHACE syndrome patients are available. \nPropranolol may increase the risk of stroke in PHACE syndrome patients with severe cerebrovascular \nanomalies by dropping blood pressure and attenuating flow through occluded, narrow, or stenotic \nvessels.  \nInfants with large facial infantile hemangioma should be thoroughly investigated for potential \narteriopathy associated with PHACE syndrome, with magnetic resonance angiography of the head and \nneck and cardiac imaging to include the aortic arch, prior to considering propranolol therapy. \nSpecialised advice should be sought. \n \nBreast-feeding: \nPropranolol passes through breast milk, mothers being treated with propranolol who breastfeed their \ninfant should inform their health care professional. \n \nLiver or kidney failure \nPropranolol is metabolised in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. In the absence of data in children, \npropranolol is not recommended in case of renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nHypersensitivity \nIn patients likely to experience severe anaphylactic reaction, regardless of origin, particularly with \niodinated contrast agents, beta-blocker treatment may lead to worsening of the reaction and resistance \nto its treatment with adrenaline at normal doses. In children who are at risk of anaphylaxis, the benefit \nrisk of the medicinal product should be evaluated.   \n \nGeneral anaesthesia  \nBeta-blockers will result in an attenuation of reflex tachycardia and an increased risk of hypotension. \nIt is necessary to alert the anaesthetist to the fact that the patient is being treated with beta-blockers. \nWhen a patient is scheduled for surgery, beta-blocker therapy should be discontinued at least 48 hours \nprior to the procedure. \n \nHyperkaliemia \nHyperkaliemia cases have been reported in patients with large ulcerated hemangioma. A monitoring of \nelectrolyte should be performed in these patients. \n \nPsoriasis  \nWorsening of disease has been reported with beta-blockers in patients suffering from psoriasis. \nTherefore the need for treatment should be carefully weighed up.  \n \nExcipients with known effects \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- \nfree’. \nThis medicinal product contains 2.08 mg of propylene glycol/kg/day. Caution should be taken into \naccount in babies less than 4 weeks old, in particular if the baby is given other medicines that contain \npropylene glycol or alcohol. \nCo-administration with any substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase such as ethanol may induce serious \nadverse effects in neonates. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn the absence of specific studies in children, the drug interactions with propranolol are those known \nin adults. Combinations should consider the 2 following situations (not mutually exclusive): \n• infants given any other medicinal products, notably those mentioned below. \n• infants breastfed by mothers taking any other medicinal products, notably those mentioned \n\nbelow. In this case, the need of stopping breast-feeding should be discussed. \nA close clinical surveillance of any impaired tolerance of propranolol is requested. \n \nConcommitant use not recommended \n \nBradycardia –inducing calcium-channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil, bepridil)  \nCo-administration with propranolol can cause altered automaticity (excessive bradycardia, sinus \narrest), sino-atrial and atrio-ventricular conduction disorders, and increased risk of ventricular \narrhythmias (torsades de pointes) along with heart failure. \nThis combination must only be administered under close clinical and ECG monitoring, particularly at \nthe start of the treatment. \n \nInteractions requiring precautions for use \n \nCardiovascular medicinal products \n \nAntiarrhythmics  \n• Propafenone has negative inotropic and beta-blocking properties that can be additive to those of \n\npropranolol. \n• The metabolism of propranolol is reduced by co-administration of quinidine, leading to a two-\n\nthree-fold increased blood concentration and greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade.  \n• Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive \n\nto those seen with β-blockers such as propranolol. Automatism and conduction disorders are \nexpected because of the suppression of sympathetic compensative mechanisms. \n\n• The metabolism of intravenous lidocaine is inhibited by co-administration of propranolol, \nresulting in a 25% increase in lidocaine concentrations. Lidocaine toxicity (neurological and \ncardiac adverse events) has been reported following co-administration with propranolol. \n\n \nDigitalis glycosides \nBoth digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. \nConcomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. The advice of a cardiologist should be sought. \n \n \nDihydropyridines \nCaution should be exercised when patients receiving a beta blocker are administered a \ndihydropyridine. Both agents may induce hypotension and/or heart failure in patients whose cardiac \nfunction is partially controlled because of additive inotropic effects. Concomitant use may reduce the \nreflex sympathetic response involved when excessive distal vasodilatation.    \n \nAntihypertensives (ACE Inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptors antagonists, diuretics, alpha-blockers \nwhatever the indication, centrally-acting antihypertensives, reserpine, etc) \nWhen combined with beta-blockers, medicinal products that decrease arterial pressure can cause or \nincrease hypotension, notably orthostatic. With regard to centrally-acting antihypertensives, beta-\nblockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension after clonidine abrupt withdrawal, and propranolol \nshould be stopped several days before discontinuing clonidine. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNon-cardiovascular medicinal products  \n \nCorticosteroids \nPatients with infantile haemangioma may be at increased risk if they have received or are \nconcomitantly receiving treatment with corticosteroids because adrenal suppression may result in loss \nof the counterregulatory cortisol response and increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. This also applies \nwhen children are breastfed by mothers treated with corticosteroids in case of high dosage or \nprolonged treatment (see section 4.4 concerning hypoglycaemia).  \n \n \nMedicinal products inducing orthostatic hypotension \nMedicinal products that induce postural hypotension (nitrates derivatives, type 5-phosphodiesterase \ninhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, dopaminergic agonists, levodopa, amifostine, \nbaclofen…) may add their effects to that of beta-blockers. The advice of a cardiologist should be \nsought. \n \nEnzyme inducers \nBlood levels of propranolol may be decreased by co-administration of enzyme inducers like rifampicin \nor phenobarbital. \n \nHypoglycaemic agents  \nAll beta-blocking agents can mask certain symptoms of hypoglycaemia: palpitations and tachycardia. \nUse of propranolol alongside hypoglycaemic therapy in diabetic patients should be with caution since \nit may prolong the hypoglycaemic response to insulin. In this case, inform the caregiver, and increase \nmonitoring of blood glucose levels, particularly at the start of treatment.  \n \nLipid lowering medicinal products  \nCo-administration of cholestyramine or colestipol with propranolol resulted in up to 50% decrease in \npropranolol concentrations.  \n \nHalogenated Anesthetic Agents \nThey may depress myocardial contractility and vascular compensating response when administered \nwith propranolol. Beta stimulating agents may be used to counteract the beta-blockade. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNot relevant. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBreastfeeding mothers: see section 4.4 and section 4.5. \n \nFertility \nAlthough some reversible effects on male and female fertilities were reported in adult rats receiving \nhigh doses of propranolol in the literature, the study performed in juvenile animals did not show any \neffect on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical trials for proliferating infantile haemangioma, the most frequently reported adverse \nreactions in infant treated with HEMANGIOL were sleep disorders (16.7%), aggravated respiratory \n\n\n\n8 \n\ntract infections such as bronchitis and bronchiolitis associated with cough and fever, diarrhoea \n(16.5%), and vomiting (11.5%).  \nGlobally, the adverse reactions reported in the compassionate use program and in literature concerned \nhypoglycemia (and related event like hypoglycaemic seizure) and aggravated respiratory tract \ninfections with respiratory distress. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following table gives the adverse reactions, reported whatever dose and treatment duration, in \nthree clinical studies, including 435 patients treated by HEMANGIOL at 1 mg/kg/day or 3 mg/kg/day \nfor a maximum treatment duration of 6 months.  \nTheir frequency is defined using the following conventions: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Due to the clinical trial database size rare \nand very rare categories are not represented. \nWithin each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n Very common  Common  Uncommon  Not known \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nBronchitis  \n \n\nBronchiolitis   \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders  \n\n Decreased \nappetite \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nSleep disorder Agitation \nNightmares \nIrritability \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Somnolence  Hypoglycemic \nseizure \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  AV block Bradycardia \n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Peripheral \ncoldness \n\n Hypotension \nVasoconstriction \nRaynaud’s \nphenomenon \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n Bronchospasm   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nDiarrhea \nVomiting \n\nConstipation \nAbdominal pain  \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n Erythema \nDermatitis diaper \n\nUrticaria \nAlopecia \n\nDermatitis \npsoriasiform \n\nInvestigations  Decreased blood \npressure \n \n\nDecreased blood \nglucose \nDecreased heart \nrate \nNeutropenia \n\nAgranulocytosis \nHyperkaliemia \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nConcerning the lower respiratory tract infections like bronchitis or bronchiolitis, an aggravation of \nsymptoms (including bronchospasm) has been observed in patients treated with HEMANGIOL due to \nthe bronchoconstrictive effect of propranolol. These effects rarely led to definitive treatment \ndiscontinuation (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nSleep disorders corresponded to insomnia, poor quality of sleep and hypersomnia. Other Central \nNervous System disorders were principally observed during the early periods of treatment. \n \nDiarrhea was frequently reported and was not always associated with an infectious gastrointestinal \ndisease. The occurrence of diarrhea seems to be dose-dependent between 1 and 3 mg/kg/day. None of \ncases was of severe intensity and led to treatment discontinuation. \n \nCardiovascular events reported during clinical studies were asymptomatic. In the context of the \n4 hours cardiovascular monitoring during the titration days, it was observed a decrease of heart rate \n(about 7 bpm) and of systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mmHg) following drug administration. One \ncase of second degree atrioventricular heart block in a patient with underlying conduction disorder led \nto definitive treatment discontinuation. Isolated cases of symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension \nhave been reported in literature. \n \nBlood sugar decreases observed during clinical studies were asymptomatic. However, several reports \nof hypoglycaemia with related hypoglycaemic seizure were reported during the compassionate use \nprogram and in literature, especially in case of fasting period during intercurrent illness (see section \n4.4). \n \nConcomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of hypoglycemia (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nHyperkalaemia has been reported in the literature in few patients with large ulcerated haemangioma \n(see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe toxicity of beta-blockers is an extension of their therapeutic effects: \n• Cardiac symptoms of mild to moderate poisoning are decreased heart rate and hypotension. \n\nAtrioventricular blocks, intraventricular conduction delays, and congestive heart failure can \noccur with more severe poisoning.  \n\n• Bronchospasm may develop particularly in patients with asthma. \n• Hypoglycemia may develop and manifestations of hypoglycemia (tremor, tachycardia) may be \n\nmasked by other clinical effects of beta-blocker toxicity. \nPropranolol is highly lipid-soluble and may cross the blood brain barrier and cause seizures. \n \nSupport and treatment:  \nThe patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor, monitor vital signs, mental status and blood \nglucose. Intravenous fluids for hypotension and atropine for bradycardia should be given. Glucagon \nthen catecholamines should be considered if the patient does not respond appropriately to intravenous \nfluid. Isoproterenol and aminophylline may be used for bronchospasm.   \n \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Beta-Blocking agent, non-selective, ATC code: C07AA05 \n \nMechanism of action \nPotential mechanisms of action of propranolol in proliferating infantile haemangioma described in the \nliterature could include various mechanisms all in close relationship: \n• a local haemodynamic effect (vasoconstriction which is a classical consequence of beta-\n\nadrenergic blockade and a decrease of infantile haemangioma lesion perfusion); \n• an antiangiogenic effect (decrease of vascular endothelial cells proliferation, reduction of the \n\nneovascularization and formation of vascular tubules, reduction of the secretion of Matrix \nMetalloproteinase 9); \n\n• an apoptosis-triggering effect on capillary endothelial cells; \n• a reduction of both VEGF and bFGF signalling pathways and subsequent angiogenesis / \n\nproliferation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nPropranolol is a beta-blocker that is characterised by three pharmacological properties: \n• the absence of cardioselective beta-1 beta-blocking activity, \n• an antiarrhythmic effect, \n• lack of partial agonist activity (or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in the paediatric population \nThe efficacy of propranolol in infants (aged 5 weeks to 5 months at treatment initiation) with \nproliferating infantile haemangioma requiring systemic therapy has been demonstrated in a pivotal \nrandomised, controlled, multicentre, multidose, adaptive phase II/III study aimed to compare four \nregimens of propranolol (1 or 3 mg/kg/day for 3 or 6 months) to placebo (double blind).  \n \nTreatment was administered to 456 subjects (401 Propranolol at a dose of 1 or 3 mg/kg/day for 3 or \n6 months; 55 Placebo), including a titration phase over 3 weeks. Patients (71.3% female; 37% aged \n35-90 days old and 63% aged 91-150 days old) presented a target haemangioma on the head in 70% \nand majority of the infantile haemangiomas were localized (89%).  \n \nTreatment success was defined as a complete or nearly complete resolution of the target \nhaemangioma, which was evaluated by blinded centralized independent assessments made on \nphotographs at Week 24, in the absence of premature treatment discontinuation. \n \nThe regimen 3 mg/kg/day during 6 months (selected at the end of the phase II part of the study) \npresented 60.4% of success versus 3.6% in the placebo arm (p value < 0.0001). Age (35-90 days / 91-\n150 days), gender and haemangioma location (head / body) subgroups did not identify differences in \nresponse to propranolol. Improvement of haemangioma was observed at 5 weeks of treatment by \npropranolol in 88% of patients. 11.4% of patients needed to be re-treated after treatment \ndiscontinuation. \nFor ethical reasons related to the use of placebo, the demonstration of the efficacy was not established \nin patients with high-risk haemangioma. Evidence of the efficacy of propranolol in patients with high-\nrisk haemangioma is available both in literature and in a specific compassionate use program \nperformed with Hemangiol. \n \nBased on a retrospective study, a minority of patients (12%) required a re-initiation of systemic \ntreatment. When treatment was re-initiated, a satisfactory response was observed in a large majority of \npatients. \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAdults \nAbsorption and distribution: \nPropranolol is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. However, it undergoes an \nextensive first-pass metabolism by the liver and on average only about 25% of propranolol reaches the \nsystemic circulation. Peak plasma concentrations occur about 1 to 4 hours after an oral dose. \nAdministration of protein-rich foods increases the bioavailability of propranolol by about 50% with no \nchange in time to peak concentration. \n \nPropranolol is a substrate for the intestinal efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). However, studies \nsuggest that P-gp is not dose-limiting for intestinal absorption of propranolol in the usual therapeutic \ndose range. \n \nApproximately 90% of circulating propranolol is bound to plasma proteins (albumin and alpha1 acid \nglycoprotein). The volume of distribution of propranolol is approximately 4 L/kg. Propranolol crosses \nthe blood-brain barrier and the placenta, and is distributed into breast milk. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination: \nPropranolol is metabolized through three primary routes: aromatic hydroxylation (mainly 4-\nhydroxylation), N-dealkylation followed by further side-chain oxidation, and direct glucuronidation. \nThe percentage contributions of these routes to total metabolism are 42%, 41% and 17%, respectively, \nbut with considerable variability between individuals. The four major final metabolites are propranolol \nglucuronide, naphthyloxylactic acid and glucuronic acid, and sulfate conjugates of 4-hydroxy \npropranolol. In vitro studies indicated that CYP2D6 (aromatic hydroxylation), CYP1A2 (chain \noxidation) and to a less extent CYP2C19 were involved in propranolol metabolism. \n \nIn healthy subjects, no difference was observed between CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and poor \nmetabolizers with respect to oral clearance or elimination half-life.  \nThe plasma half-life of propranolol ranges from 3 to 6 hours. Less than 1% of a dose is excreted as \nunchanged drug in the urine.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of repeated administrations of HEMANGIOL at 3 mg/kg/day given in 2 intakes \nhas been investigated in 19 infants aged 35 to 150 days at the beginning of treatment. The \npharmacokinetic evaluation was performed at steady-state, after 1 or 3 months of treatment. \n \nPropranolol was rapidly absorbed, the maximum plasma concentration generally occurring 2 hours \nafter administration with a corresponding mean value around 79 ng/mL whatever the infant age. \nMean apparent oral clearance was 2.71 L/h/kg in infants aged 65- 120 days and 3.27 L/h/kg in infant \naged 181- 240 days. Once corrected by the body weight, primary pharmacokinetic parameters for \npropranolol (such as plasma clearance) determined in infants were similar to those reported in the \nliterature for adults. \nThe 4-hydroxy-propranolol metabolite was quantified, its plasma exposure accounting for less than \n7% of the parent drug exposure. \n \nDuring this pharmacokinetic study including infants with function-threatening haemangioma, \nhaemangioma in certain anatomic locations that often leave permanent scars or deformity, large facial \nhaemangioma, smaller haemangioma in exposed areas, severe ulcerated haemangioma, pedunculated \nhaemangioma, efficacy was also studied as a secondary evaluation criteria. Treatment with \npropranolol resulted in a rapid improvement (within 7-14 days) in all patients and resolution of the \ntarget haemangioma was observed in 36.4% of patients by 3 months.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn animals, after an acute dosing, propranolol is considered as a moderately toxic drug with an oral \nLD50 of about 600 mg/kg. The main effects reported after repeated administration of propranolol in \nadult and juvenile rats were a transient decrease in body weight and body weight gain associated with \na transient decrease in organ weight. These effects were completely reversible when treatment was \ndiscontinued. \n  \nIn dietary administration studies in which mice and rats were treated with propranolol hydrochloride \nfor up to 18 months at doses of up to 150 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of drug-related \ntumorigenesis.  \nAlthough some data were equivocal, based on the overall available in vitro and in vivo data, it can be \nconcluded that propranolol is devoid of genotoxic potential. \n \nIn adult female rats, propranolol given into the uterus or by intravaginal administration is a powerful \nanti-implantation agent at dose ≥4 mg per animal, the effects being reversible. In adult male rats, \nrepeated administration of propranolol at high dose levels (≥7.5 mg/kg) induced histopathological \nlesions of the testes, epididymis, and seminal vesicles, decrease in sperm motility, sperm cell \nconcentration, plasma testosterone levels and significant increase in sperm head and tail abnormalities. \nThe effects generally totally reversed after treatment cessation. Similar results were obtained \nfollowing intra-testicular administration of propranolol and using in vitro models. However, in the \nstudy conducted in juvenile animals treated all over the development period corresponding to infancy, \nchildhood and adolescence, no effect on male and female fertilities was observed (See section 4.6). \n \nThe potential effects of propranolol on the development of juvenile rats were evaluated following \ndaily oral administration from post-natal Day 4 (PND 4) to PND 21 at dose-levels of 0, 10, 20 or \n40 mg/kg/day.  \nMortality with unknown although unlikely relationship to treatment was observed at 40 mg/kg/day, \nleading to a NOAEL of 20 mg/kg/day for juvenile toxicity. \nIn terms of reproductive development, growth and neurological development there were no \npropranolol-related effects or toxicologically significant findings at 40 mg/kg/day, correlating to safety \nmargins of 1.2 in females and 2.9 in males, based on mean propranolol exposures on PND 21.  \n \n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \n• Hydroxyethylcellulose \n• Sodium saccharin \n• Strawberry flavour (contains propylene glycol) \n• Vanilla flavour (contains propylene glycol) \n• Citric acid monohydrate  \n• Purified water \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nBefore opening: 3 years. \nAfter first opening: 2 months.  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nKeep the bottle in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \nDo not freeze. \nStore the bottle and the oral syringe in the outer carton between each use.  \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \n120 mL solution, in a type III amber-glass bottle fitted with a low density polyethylene insert and a \nchild resistant polypropylene screw cap, provided with a polypropylene oral syringe graduated in mg \nof propranolol base. \nPack size: carton containing 1 bottle and 1 oral syringe. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal  \n \nNo special requirements.  \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nPIERRE FABRE DERMATOLOGIE \n45 place Abel  Gance \nF- 92100 Boulogne \n \n \n\n8 MARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S)  \n \nEU/1/14/919/001 \n \n\n9 DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION \n \nDate of first authorisation: 23 April 2014 \nDate of latest renewal: \n \n\n10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n\n \n\nA.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n\n1 What HEMANGIOL is and what it is used for \n \nWhat HEMANGIOL is \nThe name of your medicine is HEMANGIOL. The active ingredient is propranolol. \nPropranolol belongs to a group of medicines known as beta-blockers. \n \nWhat it is used for \nThis medicine is used to treat a disease called haemangioma. A haemangioma is a collection of extra \nblood vessels that have formed a lump in or under the skin. Haemangioma can be superficial or deep. \nIt is sometimes called ‘strawberry mark’ because the surface of a haemangioma looks a bit like a \nstrawberry. \nHemangiol is started in infants aged 5 weeks to 5 months, when: \n\n- the localisation and/or extend of the lesions are life- or function threatening (might impair \nvital organs or senses such as vision or hearing); \n\n- the haemangioma is ulcerated (i.e. with sore on the skin which fails to heal) and painful, \nand/or does not respond to simple wound care measures; \n\n- there is a risk of permanent scars or disfigurement.  \n \n \n\n2 What you need to know before your child receives HEMANGIOL  \n \nDo not give HEMANGIOL \nIf your child: \n• is born prematurely and he/she has not reached the corrected age of 5 weeks (the corrected age \n\nbeing the age a premature baby would be if he/she had been born on their due date). \n• is allergic to propranolol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). An \n\nallergic reaction can include a rash, itching or shortness of breath. \n• has asthma or history of breathing difficulties. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n• has a slow heart rate for his/her age. Please check with your doctor if you are not sure. \n• has a heart problem (such as disorders of the heart rhythm and heart failure. \n• has very low blood pressure. \n• has circulation problems which make the toes and fingers numb and pale. \n• is prone to low blood sugar level. \n• has a high blood pressure caused by a tumour on the adrenal gland. This is called \n\n'phaeochromocytoma'. \n \nIf you are breastfeeding your child, and if you are taking medicines that must not be used with \nHEMANGIOL (see ‘‘If you are breastfeeding your child’’ and “Other medicines and HEMANGIOL”) \ndo not give this medicine to your child. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nBefore your child receives HEMANGIOL, tell your doctor: \n• If your child has problems with his/her liver or kidneys. This medicine will not be recommended \n\nin case of liver or kidneys impairment. \n• If your child has ever had an allergic reaction whatever its origin (e.g. medicine or alimentary \n\nsubstance etc.). An allergic reaction can include a rash, itching or shortness of breath. \n• If your child has psoriasis (a skin condition that produces red, dry plaques of thickened skin), as \n\nthis medicine may worsen the symptoms of this condition. \n• If your child has diabetes: in this case, your child’s blood sugar level should be measured more \n\nfrequently. \n• If your child has a PHACE syndrome (a condition combining haemangioma and vascular \n\nabnormalities including cerebral blood vessels), as this medicine may increase the risk of \ncerebral stroke. \n\n \nImportant signs to look after administration of HEMANGIOL \n \nRisk of hypotension and bradycardia (low heart rate) \nHEMANGIOL can decrease blood pressure (hypotension) and heart rate (bradycardia). This is why \nyour child will be kept under close clinical and heart rate monitoring for 2 hours after the first dose or \nafter a dose increase. Then, your doctor will regularly examine your child during treatment.  \n  \n\nCall your doctor right away if your child has any signs such as tiredness, coldness, pallor, \nbluish-coloured skin, or fainting while taking HEMANGIOL. \n\n \nRisks of hypoglycaemia \nThis medicine can mask the warning signs of hypoglycaemia (also known as low blood sugar level), \nespecially if the baby is fasting, vomiting or in case of overdose. These signs may be: \n• Minor: pallor, tiredness, sweating, shaking, palpitations, anxiety, hunger, difficulty waking up. \n• Major: excessive sleeping, difficulty responding, poor feeding, decrease in body temperature, \n\nconvulsions (fits), brief pauses in breathing, loss of consciousness. \n \n\nTo avoid risks of hypoglycaemia, your child must be fed regularly during treatment. If your \nchild is not eating, develops another illness or is vomiting, it is recommended to skip the dose. \nDO NOT GIVE HEMANGIOL TO YOUR CHILD UNTIL HE IS BEING CORRECTLY FED \nAGAIN. \n \nIf your child has any signs of hypoglycaemia while taking HEMANGIOL, give if possible oral \nliquid containing sugar and, if symptoms persist, call your doctor right away or go directly to \nhospital. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nRisks of bronchospasm \nStop treatment and contact your doctor immediately if after giving HEMANGIOL to your child you \nobserve the following symptoms suggestive of a bronchospasm (temporary restriction of the bronchial \ntubes that leads to difficulty breathing): cough, quick or difficult breathing or wheezing, associated or \nnot with a bluish-coloured skin.  \n \nRisk of hyperkaliemia \nHEMANGIOL may increase potassium blood level (hyperkaliemia). In case of large ulcerated \nhaemangioma,, your child’s blood potassium level should be measured. \n \nIf your child should undergo a general anaesthesia \nTell the your doctor that he/she is taking HEMANGIOL. This is because your child can get low blood \npressure if given certain anaesthetics while taking this medicine (see “Other medicines and \nHEMANGIOL”). HEMANGIOL might need to be discontinued at least 48h before the anaesthesia. \n \nIf you are breastfeeding your child \n• Tell your doctor before giving this medicine. \n• Do not give this medicine to your child if you are taking medicines that must not be used with \n\nHEMANGIOL (see “Other medicines and HEMANGIOL”). \n \nOther medicines and HEMANGIOL \n• Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are giving, have recently given or might give any \n\nother medicines to your child. This is because HEMANGIOL can change the way other \nmedicines work, and some medicines can have an effect on the way HEMANGIOL works. \n\n• Moreover, if you are breastfeeding your child, it is important to tell your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse which medicines you are yourself taking, as they may pass into your breast-milk and \ninterfere with the treatment of your child. Your doctor will advise you on whether you need to \nstop breastfeeding or not. \n\n \nIn particular, in case you are breastfeeding, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are or if your child is \ntaking: \n• Medicines for diabetes, \n• Medicines for heart and blood vessels problems such as uneven heart beats, chest pain or angina, \n\nhigh blood pressure, heart failure, \n• Medicines to treat anxiety and depression as well as more serious mental health problems, and \n\nepilepsy, \n• Medicines to treat tuberculosis, \n• Medicines to treat pain and inflammation, \n• Medicines used to lower lipids in the blood, \n• Medicines used for anaesthesia. \n \nIf you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nHEMANGIOL contains sodium and propylene glycol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. \nThis medicine contains 2.08 mg of propylene glycol/kg/day. If your baby is less than 4 weeks old, talk \nto your doctor or pharmacist before giving them this medicine, in particular if the baby is given other \nmedicines that contain propylene glycol or alcohol. \n \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n3 How to give HEMANGIOL to your child  \n \nThe treatment of your child has been initiated by a physician who has expertise in the diagnosis, \ntreatment and management of infantile haemangioma. \nAlways give this medicine to your child exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with \nyour doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nNever change the dose you are giving to your child yourself. Every increase in dose or any dose \nadjustment to your baby’s weight must be done by your doctor. \n\n \nDose \n• Dosing is based on your baby’s weight following the scheme below: \n\n \nWeeks  \n(daily dose) \n\nDose by intake Timing of intakes  \n\nFirst week  \n(1 mg/kg/day) \n\n0.5 mg/kg • one in the morning  \n• one in late afternoon \n• at least 9 hours interval \n\nbetween two intakes  \n \n\nSecond week  \n(2 mg/kg/day) \n\n1mg/kg \n\nThird and following weeks \n(3 mg/kg/day) \n\n1.5 mg/kg \n\n \n• If necessary, you may mix the medicine with a small quantity of baby-milk or age-adapted apple \n\nand/or orange fruit juice and give it to your child in a baby bottle. Do not mix the medicine with a \nfull bottle of milk or juice. \nFor children weighing up to 5 kg you may mix the dose with one teaspoonful of milk \n(approximately 5 mL).  For children weighing more than 5 kg the dose may be mixed with a \ntablespoonful of milk or fruit juice (approximately 15 mL). \nUse the mixture within 2 hours of preparation. \n\n \n \nHow to give HEMANGIOL to your child \n• Hemangiol is for oral use. \n• The medicine is to be given during or straight after a feed. \n• The dose should always be measured using the oral syringe supplied with the bottle. \n• Give HEMANGIOL directly into your child's mouth using the oral syringe supplied with the \n\nbottle.  \n• Feed your child regularly to avoid prolonged fast. \n• If your child is not eating or is vomiting it is recommended to skip the dose.  \n• If your child spits up a dose or if you are uncertain whether he/she got all of the medicine, do not \n\ngive another dose, just wait until the next scheduled dose. \n• HEMANGIOL and the feed must be given by the same person in order to avoid the risk of \n\nhypoglycaemia. If different people are involved, good communication is essential in order to \nensure the safety of your child. \n\n \n\nInstructions for use: \n\n• Step 1. Remove the items from the box \nThe carton contains the following items that you will need to administer the medicine: \n- The glass bottle containing 120 mL propranolol oral solution \n- The oral syringe graduated in mg provided with this medicine \nRemove the bottle and oral syringe from the box and remove the syringe from the plastic bag.  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n \n• Step 2. Check the dose \nCheck the HEMANGIOL dose in milligrams (mg) as prescribed by your doctor. Locate this number \non the oral syringe. \n\n \n• Step 3. Open the bottle \nThe bottle comes with a child-proof cap. Here is how to open it: push down the plastic cap while \nturning the cap counter-clockwise (to the left). \nDo not shake the bottle before use. \n \n\n \n \n• Step 4. Insert the syringe \nInsert tip of the oral syringe into the upright bottle and push the plunger all the way down. \nDo not remove the syringe adapter from the neck of the bottle. \nOnly use the oral syringe that is supplied with the medicine to measure and administer the dose. Do \nnot use a spoon or any other dispensing device. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n \n• Step 5: Remove the dose  \nWith the oral syringe in place, turn the bottle upside down.  \nPull the plunger of the syringe up to the number of mg you need. \n \n\n \n \n• Step 6: Check for air bubbles \nIf you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe upright, push the plunger upwards just far \nenough to completely push out any large air bubbles and then readjust to the dose prescribed by your \ndoctor. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n• Step 7. Remove the syringe \nTurn bottle upright and remove the entire syringe from the bottle. Be careful, do not push the plunger \nin during this step. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n• Step 8. Close the bottle.  \nReplace the plastic cap on the bottle by turning it clock-wise (to the right). \n \n\n \n \n• Step 9. Give HEMANGIOL to your child \nInsert the syringe into your baby’s mouth and place it against the inside of the cheek.  \nNow you can slowly squirt HEMANGIOL from the syringe directly into your baby’s mouth. \nDo not lie the child down immediately after the administration. \n \n\n \n \n• Step 10: Clean the syringe.  \nDo not dismantle the syringe. Rinse the empty syringe after each use into a glass of clean water: \n1- Take a glass of clean water \n2- Pull the plunger in \n3- Discard the water into your sink \n4- Repeat this cleaning process 3 times.  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n  \nDo not use any soap or alcohol based product to clean. Wipe the outside dry. \nDo not put the syringe through a sterilizer or dishwasher. \nStore the bottle and the syringe together in the carton until next use in a safe place where your child \ncan’t see or reach it. Discard the syringe once the bottle is finished. \n\n \n\nIf you give to your child more HEMANGIOL than you should \nIf you have given to your child more HEMANGIOL than you should, please consult your doctor \nimmediately.  \n \nIf you forget to give HEMANGIOL to your child \nSkip the missed dose, and do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Continue the \ntreatment at the usual frequency: one dose in the morning and one in the late afternoon. \n \nIf you stop giving HEMANGIOL to your child \nHEMANGIOL may be stopped at once at the end of the treatment as decided by the doctor. \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n4 Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nImportant warning signs of potential side effects such as low blood pressure, low heart rate, low blood \nsugar level, and bronchospasm (breathing difficulties) should be looked after following administration \nof HEMANGIOL.
