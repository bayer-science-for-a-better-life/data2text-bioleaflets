CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBriviact is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n\nThe recommended starting dose is either 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day based on physician assessment of \nrequired seizure reduction versus potential side effects. The dose should be administered in two \nequally divided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening. Based on individual patient \nresponse and tolerability, the dose may be adjusted in the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  \n \nMissed doses \n\nIf patients missed one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. This may avoid the \nbrivaracetam plasma concentration falling below the efficacy level and prevent breakthrough seizures \nfrom occurring. \n \nDiscontinuation \n\nIf brivaracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually by 50 mg/day on a \nweekly basis. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day, a final week of treatment at the dose of \n20 mg/day is recommended. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \nThe clinical experience in patients ≥ 65 years is limited. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). Brivaracetam \nis not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. \nBased on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal \nfunction. \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nExposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease. In adults, a \n50 mg/day starting dose should be considered. In children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or greater, a \n50 mg/day starting dose is recommended. A maximum daily dose of 150 mg administered in 2 divided \ndoses is recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \nIn children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg, a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended. \nThe maximum dose should not exceed 3 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric \npatients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and \ndose.  \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for children from 4 years of age and \nadolescents. More details are provided below the table. \n \n Children (≥4 years) and \n\nadolescents ≥50 kg \n \n\nAdministered in 2 equally divided \ndoses \n\nChildren (≥4 years) and \nadolescents <50 kg \n\n \nAdministered in 2 equally divided \n\ndoses \nTherapeutic dose range 50 - 200 mg/day 1 - 4 mg/kg/day \nRecommended starting dose 50 mg/day   \n\n(or 100 mg/day)* \n1 mg/kg/day \n(or 2 mg/kg/day)* \n\nRecommended maintenance \ndose \n\n100 mg/day 2 mg/kg/day \n\n* Based on physician assessment of need for seizure control. \n \n\nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more  \nThe recommended starting dose is 50mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based \non physician assessment of need for seizure control. The dose should be administered in two equally \ndivided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening. The recommended maintenance dose is \n100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose \nrange of 50 mg/day and 200 mg/day. \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 2 mg/kg/day \nbased on physician assessment of need for seizure control. The dose should be administered in two \nequally divided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening.The recommended maintenance \ndose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective \ndose range of 1 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day. \n \nChildren less than 4 years \n\nThe safety and efficacy of brivaracetam in children aged less than 4 years have not yet been \nestablished. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nBrivaracetam film-coated tablets must be taken orally swallowed in whole with liquid and may be \ntaken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs \n(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-\ncontrolled trials of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The \nmechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an \nincreased risk for brivaracetam. \nPatients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment \nshould be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice \nshould any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, paediatric data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic \nimpairment. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section \n4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nLactose intolerance \n\nBrivaracetam film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare heriditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium content \n\nBrivaracetam film-coated tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFormal interaction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \n\nConcomitant treatment with levetiracetam \n\nIn the clinical studies, although the numbers were limited, there was no observed benefit of \nbrivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently. No additional safety or \ntolerability concern was observed (see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single \ndose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects, there was no pharmacokinetic \ninteraction but brivaracetam approximately doubled the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function, \nattention and memory. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of other agents on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam \n\nIn vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway \nof brivaracetam is by CYP-independent hydrolysis. A second disposition pathway involves \nhydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19 (see section 5.2).  \n \nBrivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when coadministered with CYP2C19 strong \ninhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine), but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19-mediated \ninteraction is considered to be low. \n \nRifampicin \n\nIn healthy subjects, coadministration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for \n5 days), decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by \n45 %. Prescribers should consider adjusting the brivaracetam dose in patients starting or ending \ntreatment with rifampicin.  \n \nStrong enzyme inducing AEDs \n\nBrivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when coadministered with strong enzyme inducing \nAEDs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required (see table 1).  \n \nOther enzyme inducers \n\nOther strong enzyme inducers (such as St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also decrease the \nsystemic exposure of brivaracetam. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with St John’s wort should \nbe done with caution. \n \nEffects of brivaracetam on other medicinal products \nBrivaracetam given 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by \nCYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered to be low. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms \nexcept for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lanzoprazole, omeprazole, diazepam). When tested in vitro \nbrivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. No CYP3A4 induction \nwas found in vivo (see midazolam above). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and \nbrivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. \nefavirenz). In vitro interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters \nconcluded that there were no clinically relevant effects, except for OAT3. In vitro, Brivaracetam \ninhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest \nclinical dose. Brivaracetam 200mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products \ntransported by OAT3. \n \nAntiepileptic drugs \n \nPotential interactions between brivaracetam (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) and other AEDs were \ninvestigated in a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all phase 2-3 studies, in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of placebo-controlled phase 2-3 studies, and in dedicated drug-\ndrug interaction studies (for the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and \ntopiramate). The effect of the interactions on the plasma concentration is summarised in table 1 \n(increase is indicated as “↑” and decrease as “↓”, area under the plasma concentration versus time \ncurve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as Cmax).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Pharmacokinetic interactions between brivaracetam and other AEDs \nAED coadministered Influence of AED on brivaracetam \n\nplasma concentration \nInfluence of brivaracetam on \nAED plasma concentration \n\nCarbamazepine AUC 29 % ↓ \nCmax 13 % ↓ \nNo dose adjustment required \n\nCarbamazepine - None \nCarbamazepine-epoxide ↑ \n(See below)  \nNo dose adjustment required. \n\nClobazam No data available None \nClonazepam No data available None \nLacosamide No data available None  \nLamotrigine None  None  \nLevetiracetam None  None  \nOxcarbazepine  None  None (monohydroxy derivative, \n\nMHD) \nPhenobarbital AUC 19 % ↓ \n\nNo dose adjustment required \nNone  \n\nPhenytoin AUC 21 % ↓ \nNo dose adjustment required \n\nNone \na AUC 20% ↑ \na Cmax 20% ↑ \n\nPregabalin No data available None  \nTopiramate None  None  \nValproic acid None  None  \nZonisamide No data available None  \n\na based on a study involving the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg/day brivaracetam. \n \nCarbamazepine  \n\nBrivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase resulting in an increased \nconcentration of carbamazepine epoxide, an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled studies, \nthe carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37 %, 62 % and 98 % with \nlittle variability at brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively. No \nsafety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of \ncarbamazepine epoxide. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nCo-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol \n(0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. \nWhen brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum \ndaily dose) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel \n(0.15 mg), a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27 % and 23 %, respectively, was observed \nwithout impact on suppression of ovulation. There was generally no change in the concentration-time \nprofiles of the endogenous markers estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle \nstimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nPhysicians should discuss family planning and contraception with women of childbearing potential \ntaking brivaracetam (see Pregnancy). \nIf a woman decides to become pregnant, the use of brivaracetam should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nPregnancy \n \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \n\nFor all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the \nprevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3 % in the \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\ngeneral population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with \npolytherapy; however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible \nhas not been elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the \ndisease which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to brivaracetam \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women. There is no data on \nplacental transfer in humans, but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats (see \nsection 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic \npotential of brivaracetam (see section 5.3). \n \nIn clinical studies, brivaracetam was used as adjunctive therapy and when it was used with \ncarbamazepine, it induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite, \ncarbamazepine-epoxide (see section 4.5). There is insufficient data to determine the clinical \nsignificance of this effect in pregnancy. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically \nnecessary i.e. (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Studies in rats have shown \nexcretion of brivaracetam in breast milk (see section 5.3). A decision should be made whether to \ndiscontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue brivaracetam, taking into account the benefit of the \nmedicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine, the \namount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. There is insufficient data to \ndetermine the clinical significance. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on \nfertility with brivaracetam (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBrivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDue to possible differences in individual sensitivity some patients might experience somnolence, \ndizziness, and other central nervous system (CNS) related symptoms. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of \nbrivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with epilepsy, 2,388 subjects have received \nbrivaracetam, of whom 1,740 have been treated for ≥ 6 months,1,363 for ≥ 12 months, 923 for ≥24 \nmonths and 569 for ≥ 60 months (5 years). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10 %) with brivaracetam treatment were: \nsomnolence (14.3 %) and dizziness (11.0 %). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. \nSomnolence and fatigue (8.2 %) were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. The types \nof adverse reactions reported during the first 7 days of treatment were similar to those reported for the \noverall treatment period. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nThe discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 3.5 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % for patients randomized \nto brivaracetam at respectively the dose of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and 1.7 % for \npatients randomized to placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently resulting in discontinuation of \nbrivaracetam therapy were dizziness (0.8 %) and convulsion (0.8 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the three placebo-\ncontrolled, fixed-dose studies safety database in subjects ≥ 16 years of age, are listed by System Organ \nClass and frequency.  \nThe frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions from clinical trials \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nCommon Influenza \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Neutropenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon  Decreased appetite \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Type I hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Depression, anxiety, insomnia, irritability \n\nUncommon Suicidal ideation, psychotic disorder, \naggression, agitation \n\nNervous system disorders Very common  Dizziness, somnolence \nCommon \n \n\nConvulsion, vertigo \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon  \n \n\nUpper respiratory tract infections, cough \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon  \n \n\nNausea, vomiting, constipation \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon  \n \n\nFatigue \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nNeutropenia has been reported in 0.5 % (6/1099) brivaracetam patients and 0 % (0/459) placebo \npatients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline, and experienced \nadditional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of brivaracetam treatment. None of the 6 cases \nof neutropenia were severe, required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam \nand none had associated infections. \n \nSuicidal ideation has been reported in 0.3 % (3/1099) brivaracetam patients and 0.7 % (3/459) placebo \npatients. In the short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in epilepsy patients, there were no cases of \ncompleted suicide and suicide attempt, however both have been reported in open-label extension \nstudies (see section 4.4). \n \nReactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of \nbrivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. \n \nOpen-label extension studies \n \nIn patients who were followed up in the open-label extension studies for up to 8 years, the safety \nprofile was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children was consistent with the safety profile observed \nin adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of \npaediatric patients (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural \ndisorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority \nof events were mild or moderate in intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of \nstudy drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity \n(4.7 %).  \n \nThere are limited safety data from open-label studies in children from 1 month to <4 years of age. \nLimited data are available on neurodevelopment in children <4 years of age. No clinical data are \navailable in neonates. \n \nElderly  \n \nOf the 130 elderly subjects enrolled in the brivaracetam phase 2/3 development program (44 with \nepilepsy), 100 were 65-74 years of age and 30 were 75-84 years of age. The safety profile in elderly \npatients appears to be similar to that observed in younger adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness \nhave been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1,400 mg of brivaracetam. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include \ngeneral supportive measures. Since less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted in urine, haemodialysis \nis not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX23  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBrivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a \ntransmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and in endocrine cells. Although \nthe exact role of this protein remains to be elucidated it has been shown to modulate exocytosis of \nneurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for brivaracetam \nanticonvulsant activity. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of brivaracetam for the adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures (POS) was established \nin 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, multi-center studies in subjects \n16 years of age and older. The daily dose of brivaracetam ranged from 5 to 200 mg/day across these \nstudies. All studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period with no up-\ntitration. 1,558 patients received study drug of which 1,099 received brivaracetam. Study enrollment \ncriteria required that patients have uncontrolled POS despite treatment with either 1 or 2 concomitant \nAEDs. Patients were required to have at least 8 POS during the baseline period. The primary endpoints \nin the phase 3 studies were the percent reduction in POS frequency over placebo and the 50 % \nresponder rate based on 50 % reduction in POS frequency from baseline. \nThe most commonly taken AEDs at the time of study entry were carbamazepine (40.6 %), lamotrigine \n(25.2 %), valproate (20.5 %), oxcarbazepine (16.0 %), topiramate (13.5 %), phenytoin (10.2 %) and \nlevetiracetam (9.8 %). The median baseline seizure frequency across the 3 studies was 9 seizures per \n28 days. Patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 23 years. \nThe efficacy outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Overall, brivaracetam was efficacious for the \nadjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older between 50 mg/day \nand 200 mg/day.  \n \nTable 2: Key Efficacy Outcomes for Partial Onset Seizure Frequency per 28 Days \n\nStudy \n \n\nPlacebo Brivaracetam  \n* Statistically significant (p-value) \n\n50 mg/day 100 mg/day 200 mg/day \nStudy N01253(1) \n n= 96 n= 101   \n50 % Responder rate 16.7 32.7*  \n\n(p=0.008) \n~ ~ \n\n \nPercent reduction over placebo (%)  NA 22.0*  \n\n(p=0.004) \n~ ~ \n\nStudy N01252(1) \n n = 100 n = 99 n = 100  \n50 % Responder rate  20.0 27.3 \n\n(p=0.372) \n36.0(2) \n(p=0.023) \n\n~ \n \n\nPercent reduction over placebo (%) NA 9.2 \n(p=0.274) \n\n20.5(2)  \n(p=0.010) \n\n~ \n \n\nStudy N01358 \n n = 259  n = 252 n = 249 \n50% Responder rate 21.6 ~ 38.9*  \n\n(p<0.001) \n37.8*  \n\n(p<0.001) \nPercent reduction over placebo (%) NA ~ 22.8*  \n\n(p<0.001)  \n23.2*  \n\n(p<0.001) \nn = randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication  \n~ Dose not studied \n* Statistically significant \n(1) Approximately 20 % of the patients were on concomitant levetiracetam  \n(2) The primary outcome for N01252 did not achieve statistical significance based on the sequential \ntesting procedure. The 100 mg/day dose was nominally significant. \n \nIn clinical studies, a reduction in seizure frequency over placebo was higher with the dose of \n100 mg/day than with 50 mg/day. Apart from dose-dependent increases in incidences of somnolence \nand fatigue brivaracetam 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day had a similar safety profile including CNS-\nrelated AEs and with long-term use. \n \nFigure 1 shows the percentage of patients (excluding patients with concomitant levetiracetam) by \ncategory of reduction from baseline in POS frequency per 28 days in all 3 studies. Patients with more \nthan a 25 % increase in POS are shown at left as “worse”. Patients with an improvement in percent \nreduction in baseline POS frequency are shown in the 4 right-most categories. The percentages of \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\npatients with at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency were 20.3 %, 34.2 %, 39.5 %, and 37.8 % \nfor placebo, 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.   \n \n\nFigure 1: Proportion of patients by category of seizure response for brivaracetam and placebo over \n\n12 weeks across all three double-blind pivotal trials \n\n \n \nIn a pooled analysis of the three pivotal trials, no differences in efficacy (measured as 50 % responder \nrate) was observed within the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day when brivaracetam is combined \nwith inducing or non-inducing AEDs. In clinical studies 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 4.0% \n(10/249) of the patients on brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively became \nseizure free during the 12-week treatment period compared with 0.5 % (2/418) on placebo.  \n \nImprovement in the median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days has been observed in \npatients with type IC seizure (secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) at baseline treated with \nbrivaracetam (66.6 % (n=62), 61.2 % (n=100) and 82.1 % (n=75) of the patients on brivaracetam \n50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively as compared to placebo 33.3 % (n=115)).  \n \nThe efficacy of brivaracetam in monotherapy has not been established. Brivaracetam is not \nrecommended for use in monotherapy.  \n \nTreatment with levetiracetam \n \nIn two phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled studies, levetiracetam was administered as concomitant \nAED in about 20 % of the patients. Although the number of subjects is limited, there was no observed \nbenefit of brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently which may reflect \ncompetition at the SV2A binding site. No additional safety or tolerability concerns were observed. \n \nIn a third study, a pre-specified analysis demonstrated efficacy over placebo for 100 mg/day and \n200 mg/day in patients with prior exposure to levetiracetam. The lower efficacy observed in these \npatients compared to the leveticacetam-naïve patients was likely due to the higher number of prior \nAEDs used and higher baseline seizure frequency. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nThe three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled studies included 38 elderly patients aged between \n65 and 80 years. Although data are limited, the efficacy was comparable to younger subjects. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nOpen label extension studies \n\nAcross all studies, 81.7 % of the patients who completed randomized studies were enrolled in the \nlong-term open-label extension studies. From entry into the randomized studies,5.3 % of the subjects \nexposed to brivaracetam for 6 months (n=1,500) were seizure free compared to 4.6 % and 3.7 % for \nsubjects exposed for 12 months (n=1,188) and 24 months (n=847), respectively. However, as a high \nproportion of subjects (26%) discontinued from the open-label studies due to lack of efficacy, a \nselection bias may have occurred, as the subjects who stayed in the study responded better than those \nwho have terminated prematurely. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn children aged 4 years and older, partial onset seizures have a similar clinical expression to those in \nadolescents and adults. Experience with epilepsy medicines suggests that the results of efficacy studies \nperformed in adults can be extrapolated to children down to the age of 4 years provided the paediatric \ndose adaptations are established and safety has been demonstrated (see sections 5.2 and 4.8). Doses in \npatients from 4 years of age were defined by weight-based dose adaptations which have been \nestablished to achieve similar plasma concentrations to the ones observed in adults taking efficacious \ndoses (section 5.2). \n  \nA long-term, uncontrolled, open-label safety study included children (from 4 years to less than 16 \nyears) who continued treatment after completing the PK study (see section 5.2) and children directly \nenrolled into the safety study. Children who directly enrolled received a brivaracetam starting dose of \n1 mg/kg/day and depending on response and tolerability, the dose was increased up to 5 mg/kg/day by \ndoubling the dose at weekly intervals. No child received a dose greater than 200 mg/day. For children \nweighing 50 kg or greater the brivaracetam starting dose was 50 mg/day and depending on response \nand tolerability, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 200 mg/day by weekly increments of \n50 mg/day.  \n \nFrom the pooled open-label safety and PK studies in adjunctive therapy, 149 children  with POS have \nreceived brivaracetam, of whom 116 have been treated for ≥6 months, 107 for ≥12 months, 58 for ≥24 \nmonths, and 28 for ≥36 months. \n \nThe efficacy and tolerability of brivaracetam in paediatric patients less than 4 years of age have not \nbeen established (see section 4.2). Brivaracetam was evaluated in these patients in a short term open-\nlabel pharmacokinetic study and an ongoing open-label extension study, in 16 subjects from 1 month \nto <4 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nbrivaracetam in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy with partial onset \nseizures. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBrivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution and solution for intravenous injection show the same \nAUC, while the maximum plasma concentration is slightly higher after intravenous administration. \nBrivaracetam exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject \nvariability, and features complete absorption, very low protein binding, renal excretion following \nextensive biotransformation, and pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nBrivaracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and the absolute \nbioavailablity is approximately 100 %. The median tmax for tablets taken without food is 1 hour (tmax \nrange is 0.25 to 3 h).  \nCoadministration with a high-fat meal slowed down the absorption rate (median tmax 3 h) and \ndecreased the maximum plasma concentration (37 % lower) of brivaracetam, while the extent of \nabsorption remained unchanged. \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \nDistribution \n \nBrivaracetam is weakly bound (≤ 20 %) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg, a \nvalue close to that of the total body water. \nDue to its lipophylicity (Log P) brivaracetam has high cell membrane permeability.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBrivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding \ncarboxylic acid (approximately 60 % the elimination), and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl \nside chain (approximately 30 % the elimination). The hydrolysis of the amide moiety leading to the \ncarboxylic acid metabolite (34 % of the dose in urine) is supported by hepatic and extra-hepatic \namidase. In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Both \nmetabolites, are further metabolised forming a common hydroxylated acid formed predominantly by \nhydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). In vivo, \nin human subjects possessing ineffective mutations of CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy \nmetabolite is decreased 10-fold while brivaracetam itself is increased by 22 % or 42 % in individuals \nwith one or both mutated alleles. The three metabolites are not pharmacologically active. \n \nElimination \n \nBrivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95 % of \nthe dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Less than 1 % of \nthe dose is excreted in faeces and less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted unchanged in urine. The \nterminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance in patients was \nestimated to 3.6 L/h.  \n \nLinearity \n \nPharmacokinetics is dose-proportional from 10 to at least 600 mg. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nBrivaracetam is cleared by multiple pathways including renal excretion, non-CYP-mediated \nhydrolysis and CYP-mediated oxidations. In vitro, brivaracetam is not a substrate of human P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 1 and 2, and likely not organic anion \ntransporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. \nIn vitro assays showed that brivaracetam disposition should not be significantly affected by CYP (eg. \nCYP1A, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4) inhibitors. \n \nIn vitro, brivaracetam was not an inhibitor of the CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4, or the \ntransporters P-gp, BCRP, BSEP MRP2, MATE-K, MATE-1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and \nOCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A2.  \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nIn a study in elderly subjects (65 to79 years old; with creatinine clearance 53 to 98 ml/min/1.73 m²) \nreceiving brivaracetam 400 mg/day in bid administration, the plasma half-life of brivaracetam was \n7.9 hours and 9.3 hours in the 65 to 75 and >75 years groups, respectively. The steady-state plasma \nclearance of brivaracetam was similar (0.76 ml/min/kg) to young healthy male subjects \n(0.83 ml/min/kg) (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA study in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min/1.73 m² and not \nrequiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased (+21 %) \nrelative to healthy controls, while the AUC of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites were \nincreased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The renal clearance of these non active metabolites was \ndecreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did not reveal any safety concerns in non clinical \nstudies. Brivaracetam has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grades A, B, and C) showed \nsimilar increases in exposure to brivaracetam irrespective of disease severity (50 %, 57 % and 59 %), \nrelative to matched healthy controls. (see section 4.2) \n \nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration using \nthe brivaracetam oral solution, 99 subjects aged 1 month to <16 years were evaluated. Brivaracetam \nwas administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and \n4 mg/kg/day. All doses were adjusted by body weight, and did not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day, \n100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day. At the end of the evaluation period, subjects may have been eligible for \nentry into a long-term follow-up study continuing on their last received dose (see section 4.8). Plasma \nconcentrations were shown to be dose-proportional in all age groups. Population pharmacokinetics \nmodeling indicated that the dose of 2.0 mg/kg twice a day provides the same steady-state average \nplasma concentration as in adults receiving 100 mg twice daily. The estimated plasma clearance was \n1.61 L/h, 2.18  L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In \ncomparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult patients (70 kg body weight). \nCurrently, no clinical data are available in neonates. \n \nBody weight \n\nA 40 % decrease in steady-state plasma concentration has been estimated across a body weight range \nfrom 46 kg to 115 kg. However, this is not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.  \n \nGender \n\nThere are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam by gender. \n  \nRace \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam was not significantly affected by race (Caucasian, Asian) in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic modeling from epilepsy patients. The number of patients with other ethnic \nbackground was limited. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship \n \nThe EC50 (brivaracetam plasma concentration corresponding to 50 % of the maximum effect) was \nestimated to be 0.57 mg/L. This plasma concentration is slightly above the median exposure obtained \nafter brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day. Further seizure frequency reduction is obtained by increasing \nthe dose to 100 mg/day and reaches a plateau at 200 mg/day. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn safety pharmacology studies, the predominant effects were CNS related (mainly transient CNS \ndepression and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity) seen at multiples (greater than 50 fold) of \nthe pharmacologically active dose of brivaracetam, 2 mg/kg. Learning and memory function were not \naffected.  \n \nFindings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the repeated-dose toxicology dog studies at \nexposure similar to the clinical plasma AUC, were hepatotoxic effects (mainly porphyria). However, \ntoxicological data accumulated on brivaracetam and on a structurally-related compound indicate that \nthe dog liver changes have developed through mechanisms not relevant for humans. No adverse liver \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nchanges were seen in rats and monkeys following chronic administration of brivaracetam at 5- and 42-\nfold the clinical AUC exposure. In monkeys, CNS signs (prostrate, loss of balance, clumsy \nmovements) occurred at 64 fold the clinical Cmax, these effects being less apparent over time. \n \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Carcinogenicity studies \ndid not indicate any oncogenic potential in rats, whereas increased incidences of hepatocellular tumors \nin male mice are considered to result of a non-genotoxic, mode of action linked to a phenobarbitone-\nlike liver enzyme induction, which is a known rodent specific phenomenon.  \n \nBrivaracetam did not affect male or female fertility and has demonstrated no teratogenic potential in \neither rat or rabbit. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at a maternal toxic dose of brivaracetam \nwith an exposure level 8-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum recommended dose. In rats, \nbrivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of lactating rats with \nconcentrations similar to maternal plasma levels. \n \nBrivaracetam did not show any dependence potential in rats. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \n \n\nIn juvenile rats, brivaracetam exposure levels 6- to 15-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum \nrecommended dose induced developmental adverse effects (i.e. mortality, clinical signs, decreased \nbody weight and lower brain weight). There were no adverse effects on CNS function, \nneuropathological and brain histopathological examination. In juvenile dogs, the brivaracetam-induced \nchanges at the exposure level 6- fold the clinical AUC were similar to those observed in adult animals. \nThere were no adverse effects in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBriviact 10 mg/ml oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 10 mg brivaracetam. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach ml of oral solution contains 239.8 mg sorbitol (E420), 1 mg methyl parahydroxybenzoate \n(E218), 1.16 mg sodium and maximum 5.5 mg propylene glycol (E1520). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution \nSlightly viscous, clear colourless to yellowish liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBriviact is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \n\nThe recommended starting dose is either 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day based on physician assessment of \nrequired seizure reduction versus potential side effects. The dose should be administered in two \nequally divided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening. Based on individual patient \nresponse and tolerability, the dose may be adjusted in the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  \n \nMissed doses \n\nIf patients missed one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. This may avoid the \nbrivaracetam plasma concentration falling below the efficacy level and prevent breakthrough seizures \nfrom occurring. \n \nDiscontinuation \n\nIf brivaracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually by 50 mg/day on a \nweekly basis. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day, a final week of treatment at the dose of \n20 mg/day is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \nThe clinical experience in patients ≥ 65 years is limited. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). Brivaracetam \nis not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. \nBased on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal \nfunction. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nExposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease. In adults, a \n50 mg/day starting dose should be considered. In children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or greater, a \n50 mg/day starting dose is recommended. A maximum daily dose of 150 mg administered in 2 divided \ndoses is recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2).  \nIn children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg, a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended. \nThe maximum dose should not exceed 3 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric \npatients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and \ndose.  It is recommended to parent and care giver to administer Briviact oral solution with the \nmeasuring device (10 ml or 5 ml oral dosing syringe) provided in the carton box. \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for children from 4 years of age and \nadolescents. More details are provided below the table. \n \n Children (≥4 years) and \n\nadolescents ≥50 kg \n \n\nAdministered in 2 equally divided \ndoses \n\nChildren (≥4 years) and \nadolescents <50 kg \n\n \nAdministered in 2 equally divided \n\ndoses \nTherapeutic dose range 50 - 200 mg/day 1 - 4 mg/kg/day \nRecommended starting dose 50 mg/day   \n\n(or 100 mg/day)* \n1 mg/kg/day \n(or 2 mg/kg/day)* \n\nRecommended maintenance \ndose \n\n100 mg/day 2 mg/kg/day \n\n* Based on physician assessment of need for seizure control. \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more  \nThe recommended starting dose is 50mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based \non physician assessment of need for seizure control. The dose should be administered in two equally \ndivided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening.The recommended maintenance dose is \n100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose \nrange of 50 mg/day and 200 mg/day. \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 1mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 2 mg/kg/day \nbased on physician assessment of need for seizure control. The dose should be administered in two \nequally divided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening. The recommended maintenance \ndose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective \ndose range of 1 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nThe dose per intake for each patient should be calculated using the following formula: \n \n\nVolume per administration (ml) = [weight (kg) x daily dose (mg/kg/day) ] x 0.05 \n \nThe table below provides examples of volumes of oral solution per intake depending on prescribed \ndose and body weight. The precise volume of oral solution is to be calculated according to the exact \nbody weight of the child. \n Volumes of oral solution to be taken per administration \nWeight  \n\nFor a dose of \n\n1 mg/kg/day \n\n0.05 ml/kg/intake \n\n(corresponding to \n0.5 mg/kg/intake) \n\nFor a dose of \n\n2 mg/kg/day \n\n0.1 ml/kg/intake \n\n(corresponding to \n1 mg/kg/intake) \n\nFor a dose of \n\n3 mg/kg/day \n\n0.15 ml/kg/intake \n\n(corresponding to \n1.5 mg/kg/intake) \n\nFor a dose of \n\n4 mg/kg/day \n\n0.2 ml/kg/intake \n\n(corresponding to \n2 mg/kg/intake) \n\n10 kg 0.5 ml  \n(5 mg) \n\n1 ml \n(10 mg) \n\n1.5 ml \n(15 mg) \n\n2 ml \n(20 mg) \n\n15 kg 0.75 ml  \n(7.5 mg) \n\n1.5 ml \n(15 mg) \n\n2.25 ml \n(22.5 mg) \n\n3 ml \n(30 mg) \n\n20 kg 1 ml \n(10 mg) \n\n2 ml \n(20 mg) \n\n3 ml \n(30 mg) \n\n4 ml \n(40 mg) \n\n25 kg 1.25 ml \n(12.5 mg) \n\n2.5 ml \n(25 mg) \n\n3.75 ml \n(37.5 mg) \n\n5 ml \n(50 mg) \n\n30 kg 1.5 ml \n(15 mg) \n\n3 ml \n(30 mg) \n\n4.5 ml \n(45 mg) \n\n6 ml \n(60 mg) \n\n35 kg 1.75 ml \n(17.5 mg) \n\n3.5 ml \n(35 mg) \n\n5.25 ml \n(52.5 mg) \n\n7 ml \n(70 mg) \n\n40 kg 2 ml \n(20 mg) \n\n4 ml \n(40 mg) \n\n6 ml \n(60 mg) \n\n8 ml \n(80 mg) \n\n45 kg 2.25 ml \n(22.5 mg) \n\n4.5 ml \n(45mg) \n\n6.75 ml \n(67.5 mg) \n\n9 ml \n(90 mg) \n\n50 kg 2.5 ml \n(25 mg) \n\n5 ml \n(50 mg) \n\n7.5 ml \n(75 mg) \n\n10 ml \n(100 mg) \n\n \nChildren less than 4 years \n\nThe safety and efficacy of brivaracetam in children aged less than 4 years have not yet been \nestablished. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nBrivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing and may be \ntaken with or without food (see section 5.2). A nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may be used \nwhen administering brivaracetam oral solution.  \n \nBriviact oral solution is provided with a 5 ml and a 10 ml oral dosing syringe with their adaptor.  \n \nOral dosing syringe (5 ml graduated every 0.1 ml) with an adaptor, recommended for use by patients \n\nweighing less than 20 kg or needing a maximum of 50 mg (5 ml) brivaracetam per administration. \n\nThe 5 ml oral syringe must be used in patients weighing less than 20 kg to ensure accurate dosing as \nthe 10 ml oral syringe does not allow accurate measurements of volumes <1 ml. \nOne full 5 ml oral dosing syringe corresponds to 50 mg of brivaracetam. The minimum extractible \nvolume is 0.25 ml which is 2.5 mg of brivaracetam. As from the 0.1 ml graduation mark, each \ngraduation corresponds to 0.1 ml which is 1 mg of brivaracetam. Additional graduations at 0.25 ml \nand 0.75 ml starting at 0.25 ml up to 5 ml are shown. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \nOral dosing syringe (10 ml graduated every 0.25 ml) with an adaptor, recommended for use by \n\npatients weighing more than 20 kg or needing a dose between 50 mg and 100 mg (5 ml to 10 ml) \n\nbrivaracetam per administration. \n\nOne full 10 ml oral dosing syringe corresponds to 100 mg of brivaracetam. The minimum extractible \nvolume is 1 ml which is 10 mg of brivaracetam. As from the 1 ml graduation mark, each graduation \ncorresponds to 0.25 ml which is 2.5 mg of brivaracetam. \n \nInstructions for use are provided in the package leaflet.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs \n(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-\ncontrolled trials of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The \nmechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an \nincreased risk for brivaracetam. \nPatients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment \nshould be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice \nshould any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, paediatric data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic \nimpairment. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section \n4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n\nBrivaracetam oral solution contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per ml, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium free’. \n \nFructose intolerance \n\nThe oral solution contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n \nExcipients which may cause intolerance \n\nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218), which may cause allergic reactions \n(possibly delayed). \nBrivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFormal interaction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \n\nConcomitant treatment with levetiracetam \n\nIn the clinical studies, although the numbers were limited, there was no observed benefit of \nbrivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently. No additional safety or \ntolerability concern was observed (see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single \ndose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects, there was no pharmacokinetic \ninteraction but brivaracetam approximately doubled the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function, \nattention and memory. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of other agents on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam \n\nIn vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway \nof brivaracetam is by CYP-independent hydrolysis. A second disposition pathway involves \nhydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19 (see section 5.2).  \n \nBrivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when coadministered with CYP2C19 strong \ninhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine), but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19-mediated \ninteraction is considered to be low. \n \nRifampicin \n\nIn healthy subjects, coadministration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for \n5 days), decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by \n45 %. Prescribers should consider adjusting the brivaracetam dose in patients starting or ending \ntreatment with rifampicin.  \n \nStrong enzyme inducing AEDs \n\nBrivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when coadministered with strong enzyme inducing \nAEDs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required (see table 1).  \n \nOther enzyme inducers \n\nOther strong enzyme inducers (such as St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also decrease the \nsystemic exposure of brivaracetam. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with St John’s wort should \nbe done with caution. \n \nEffects of brivaracetam on other medicinal products  \nBrivaracetam given 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by \nCYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered to be low. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms \nexcept for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lanzoprazole, omeprazole, diazepam). When tested in vitro \nbrivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. No CYP3A4 induction \nwas found in vivo (see midazolam above). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and \nbrivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 \n(e.g. efavirenz). In vitro, interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters \nconcluded that there were no clinically relevant effects, except for OAT3. In vitro, brivaracetam \ninhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest \nclinical dose. Brivaracetam 200mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products \ntransported by OAT3. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nAntiepileptic drugs \n \nPotential interactions between brivaracetam (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) and other AEDs were \ninvestigated in a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all phase 2-3 studies in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of placebo-controlled phase 2-3 studies, and in dedicated drug-\ndrug interaction studies (for the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and \ntopiramate). The effect of the interactions on the plasma concentration is summarised in table 1 \n(increase is indicated as “↑” and decrease as “↓”, area under the plasma concentration versus time \ncurve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as Cmax).  \n \nTable 1: Pharmacokinetic interactions between brivaracetam and other AEDs \n\nAED coadministered Influence of AED on brivaracetam \nplasma concentration \n\nInfluence of brivaracetam on \nAED plasma concentration \n\nCarbamazepine AUC 29 % ↓ \nCmax 13 % ↓ \nNo dose adjustment required \n\nCarbamazepine - None \nCarbamazepine-epoxide ↑ \n(See below)  \nNo dose adjustment required. \n\nClobazam No data available None \nClonazepam No data available None \nLacosamide No data available None  \nLamotrigine None  None  \nLevetiracetam None  None  \nOxcarbazepine  None  None (monohydroxy derivative, \n\nMHD) \nPhenobarbital AUC 19 % ↓ \n\nNo dose adjustment required \nNone  \n\nPhenytoin AUC 21 % ↓ \nNo dose adjustment required \n\nNone \na AUC 20% ↑ \na Cmax 20% ↑ \n\nPregabalin No data available None  \nTopiramate None  None  \nValproic acid None  None  \nZonisamide No data available None  \n\na based on a study involving the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg/day brivaracetam \n \n\nCarbamazepine  \n\nBrivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase resulting in an increased \nconcentration of carbamazepine epoxide, an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled studies, \nthe carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37 %, 62 % and 98 % with \nlittle variability at brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively. No \nsafety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of \ncarbamazepine epoxide. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nCo-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol \n(0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. \nWhen brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum \ndaily dose) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel \n(0.15 mg), a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27 % and 23 %, respectively, was observed \nwithout impact on suppression of ovulation. There was generally no change in the concentration-time \nprofiles of the endogenous markers estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle \nstimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nPhysicians should discuss family planning and contraception with women of childbearing potential \ntaking brivaracetam (see Pregnancy). \nIf a woman decides to become pregnant, the use of brivaracetam should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nPregnancy \n \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \n\nFor all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the \nprevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3 % in the \ngeneral population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with \npolytherapy; however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible \nhas not been elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the \ndisease which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to brivaracetam \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women. There is no data on \nplacental transfer in humans, but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats (see \nsection 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic \npotential of brivaracetam (see section 5.3). \n \nIn clinical studies, brivaracetam was used as adjunctive therapy and when it was used with \ncarbamazepine, it induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite, \ncarbamazepine-epoxide (see section 4.5). There is insufficient data to determine the clinical \nsignificance of this effect in pregnancy. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically \nnecessary i.e. (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Studies in rats have shown \nexcretion of brivaracetam in breast milk (see section 5.3). A decision should be made whether to \ndiscontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue brivaracetam, taking into account the benefit of the \nmedicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine, the \namount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. There is insufficient data to \ndetermine the clinical significance. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on \nfertility with brivaracetam (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBrivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDue to possible differences in individual sensitivity some patients might experience somnolence, \ndizziness, and other central nervous system (CNS) related symptoms. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of \nbrivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities.   \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with epilepsy, 2,388 subjects have received \nbrivaracetam, of whom 1,740 have been treated for ≥ 6 months,1,363 for ≥ 12 months, 923 for ≥ \n24 months and 569 for ≥ 60 months (5 years). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10 %) with brivaracetam treatment were: \nsomnolence (14.3 %) and dizziness (11.0 %). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. \nSomnolence and fatigue (8.2 %) were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. The types \nof adverse reactions reported during the first 7 days of treatment were similar to those reported for the \noverall treatment period. \n \nThe discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 3.5 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % for patients randomized \nto brivaracetam at respectively the dose of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and 1.7% for \npatients randomized to placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently resulting in discontinuation of \nbrivaracetam therapy were dizziness (0.8 %) and convulsion (0.8 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the three placebo-\ncontrolled, fixed-dose studies safety database in subjects ≥ 16 years of age, are listed by System Organ \nClass and frequency.  \nThe frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions from clinical trials \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nCommon Influenza \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Neutropenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon  Decreased appetite \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Type I hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Depression, anxiety, insomnia, irritability \n\nUncommon Suicidal ideation, psychotic disorder, \naggression, agitation \n\nNervous system disorders Very common  Dizziness, somnolence \nCommon \n \n\nConvulsion, vertigo \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon  \n \n\nUpper respiratory tract infections, cough \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon  \n \n\nNausea, vomiting, constipation \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon  \n \n\nFatigue \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nNeutropenia has been reported in 0.5 % (6/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0 % (0/459) placebo \npatients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline, and experienced \nadditional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of brivaracetam treatment. None of the 6 cases \nof neutropenia were severe, required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam \nand none had associated infections. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \nSuicidal ideation has been reported in 0.3 % (3/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0.7 % (3/459) \nplacebo patients. In the short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in epilepsy patients, there were no \ncases of completed suicide and suicide attempt, however both have been reported in open-label \nextension studies (see section 4.4). \n \nReactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of \nbrivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. \n \nOpen-label extension studies \n \nIn patients who were followed up in the open-label extension studies for up to 8 years, the safety \nprofile was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children was consistent with the safety profile observed \nin adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of \npaediatric patients (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural \ndisorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority \nof events were mild or moderate in intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of \nstudy drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity \n(4.7 %).  \n \nThere are limited safety data from open-label studies in children from 1 month to <4 years of age. \nLimited data are available on neurodevelopment in children <4 years of age. No clinical data are \navailable in neonates.  \n \nElderly  \n \nOf the 130 elderly subjects enrolled in the brivaracetam phase 2/3 development program (44 with \nepilepsy), 100 were 65-74 years of age and 30 were 75-84 years of age. The safety profile in elderly \npatients appears to be similar to that observed in younger adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness \nhave been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1,400 mg of brivaracetam. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include \ngeneral supportive measures. Since less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted in urine, haemodialysis \nis not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance (see section 5.2). \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX23  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBrivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a \ntransmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and in endocrine cells. Although \nthe exact role of this protein remains to be elucidated it has been shown to modulate exocytosis of \nneurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for brivaracetam \nanticonvulsant activity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of brivaracetam for the adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures (POS) was established \nin 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, multi-center studies in subjects \n16 years of age and older. The daily dose of brivaracetam ranged from 5 to 200 mg/day across these \nstudies. All studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period with no up-\ntitration. 1,558 patients received study drug of which 1,099 received brivaracetam. Study enrollment \ncriteria required that patients have uncontrolled POS despite treatment with either 1 or 2 concomitant \nAEDs. Patients were required to have at least 8 POS during the baseline period. The primary endpoints \nin the phase 3 studies were the percent reduction in POS frequency over placebo and the 50 % \nresponder rate based on 50 % reduction in POS frequency from baseline. \nThe most commonly taken AEDs at the time of study entry were carbamazepine (40.6 %), lamotrigine \n(25.2 %), valproate (20.5 %), oxcarbazepine (16.0 %), topiramate (13.5 %), phenytoin (10.2 %) and \nlevetiracetam (9.8 %). The median baseline seizure frequency across the 3 studies was 9 seizures per \n28 days. Patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 23 years. \nThe efficacy outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Overall, brivaracetam was efficacious for the \nadjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older between 50 mg/day \nand 200 mg/day.  \n \nTable 2: Key Efficacy Outcomes for Partial Onset Seizure Frequency per 28 Days \n\nStudy \n \n\nPlacebo Brivaracetam  \n* Statistically significant (p-value) \n\n50 mg/day 100 mg/day 200 mg/day \nStudy N01253(1) \n n= 96 n= 101   \n50 % Responder rate 16.7 32.7*  \n\n(p=0.008) \n~ ~ \n\n \nPercent reduction over placebo (%)  NA 22.0*  \n\n(p=0.004) \n~ ~ \n\nStudy N01252(1) \n n = 100 n = 99 n = 100  \n50 % Responder rate  20.0 27.3 \n\n(p=0.372) \n36.0(2) \n(p=0.023) \n\n~ \n \n\nPercent reduction over placebo (%) NA 9.2 \n(p=0.274) \n\n20.5(2) \n(p=0.010) \n\n~ \n \n\nStudy N01358 \n n = 259  n = 252 n = 249 \n50% Responder rate 21.6 ~ 38.9*  \n\n(p<0.001) \n37.8*  \n\n(p<0.001) \nPercent reduction over placebo (%) NA ~ 22.8*  \n\n(p<0.001)  \n23.2*  \n\n(p<0.001) \nn = randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication  \n~ Dose not studied \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n* Statistically significant \n(1) Approximately 20 % of the patients were on concomitant levetiracetam  \n(2) The primary outcome for N01252 did not achieve statistical significance based on the sequential \ntesting procedure . The 100 mg/day dose was nominally significant. \n \nIn clinical studies, a reduction in seizure frequency over placebo was higher with the dose of \n100 mg/day than with 50 mg/day. Apart from dose-dependent increases in incidences of somnolence \nand fatigue brivaracetam 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day had a similar safety profile including CNS-\nrelated AEs and with long-term use. \n \nFigure 1 shows the percentage of patients (excluding patients with concomitant levetiracetam) by \ncategory of reduction from baseline in POS frequency per 28 days in all 3 studies. Patients with more \nthan a 25 % increase in POS are shown at left as “worse”. Patients with an improvement in percent \nreduction in baseline POS frequency are shown in the 4 right-most categories. The percentages of \npatients with at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency were 20.3 %, 34.2 %, 39.5 %, and 37.8 % \nfor placebo, 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.   \n \n\nFigure 1: Proportion of patients by category of seizure response for brivaracetam and placebo over \n\n12 weeks across all three double-blind pivotal trials \n\n \n \nIn a pooled analysis of the three pivotal trials, no differences in efficacy (measured as 50 % responder \nrate) was observed within the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day when brivaracetam is combined \nwith inducing or non-inducing AEDs. In clinical studies 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 4.0% \n(10/249) of the patients on brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively became \nseizure free during the 12-week treatment period compared with 0.5 % (2/418) on placebo.  \n \nImprovement in the median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days has been observed in \npatients with type IC seizure (secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) at baseline treated with \nbrivaracetam (66.6 % (n=62), 61.2 % (n=100) and 82.1 % (n=75) of the patients on brivaracetam \n50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively as compared to placebo 33.3 % (n=115)).  \n \nThe efficacy of brivaracetam in monotherapy has not been established. Brivaracetam is not \nrecommended for use in monotherapy.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nTreatment with levetiracetam \n \nIn two phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled studies, levetiracetam was administered as concomitant \nAED in about 20 % of the patients. Although the number of subjects is limited, there was no observed \nbenefit of brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently which may reflect \ncompetition at the SV2A binding site. No additional safety or tolerability concerns were observed. \n \nIn a third study, a pre-specified analysis demonstrated efficacy over placebo for 100 mg/day and 200 \nmg/day in patients with prior exposure to levetiracetam. The lower efficacy observed in these patients \ncompared to the leveticacetam-naïve patients was likely due to the higher number of prior AEDs used \nand higher baseline seizure frequency. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nThe three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled studies included 38 elderly patients aged between \n65 and 80 years. Although data are limited, the efficacy was comparable to younger subjects. \n \nOpen label extension studies \n\nAcross all studies, 81.7 % of the patients who completed randomized studies were enrolled in the \nlong-term open-label extension studies. From entry into the randomized studies,5.3 % of the subjects \nexposed to brivaracetam for 6 months (n=1,500) were seizure free compared to 4.6 % and 3.7 % for \nsubjects exposed for 12 months (n=1,188) and 24 months (n=847), respectively. However, as a high \nproportion of subjects (26%) discontinued from the open-label studies due to lack of efficacy, a \nselection bias may have occurred, as the subjects who stayed in the study responded better than those \nwho have terminated prematurely. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn children aged 4 years and older, partial onset seizures have a similar clinical expression to those in \nadolescents and adults. Experience with epilepsy medicines suggests that the results of efficacy studies \nperformed in adults can be extrapolated to children down to the age of 4 years provided the paediatric \ndose adaptations are established and safety has been demonstrated (see sections 5.2 and 4.8). Doses in \npatients from 4 years of age were defined by weight-based dose adaptations which have been \nestablished to achieve similar plasma concentrations to the ones observed in adults taking efficacious \ndoses (section 5.2).  \n \nA long-term, uncontrolled, open-label safety study included children (from 4 years to less than 16 \nyears) who continued treatment after completing the PK study (see section 5.2) and children directly \nenrolled into the safety study. Children who directly enrolled received a brivaracetam starting dose of \n1 mg/kg/day and depending on response and tolerability, the dose was increased up to 5 mg/kg/day by \ndoubling the dose at weekly intervals. No child received a dose greater than 200 mg/day. For children \nweighing 50 kg or greater the brivaracetam starting dose was 50 mg/day and depending on response \nand tolerability, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 200 mg/day by weekly increments of \n50 mg/day.  \n \nFrom the pooled open-label safety and PK studies in adjunctive therapy, 149 children have received \nbrivaracetam, of whom 116 have been treated for ≥6 months, 107 for ≥12 months, 58 for ≥24 months, \nand 28 for ≥36 months. \n \nThe efficacy and tolerability of brivaracetam in paediatric patients less than 4 years of age have not \nbeen established (see section 4.2). Brivaracetam was evaluated in these patients in a short term open-\nlabel pharmacokinetic study and an ongoing open-label extension study, in 16 subjects from 1 month \nto <4 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nbrivaracetam in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy with partial onset \nseizures. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBrivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution and solution for intravenous injection show the same \nAUC, while the maximum plasma concentration is slightly higher after intravenous administration. \nBrivaracetam exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject \nvariability, and features complete absorption, very low protein binding, renal excretion following \nextensive biotransformation, and pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nBrivaracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and the absolute \nbioavailablity is approximately 100 %. The median tmax for tablets taken without food is 1 hour (tmax \nrange is 0.25 to 3 h).  \nCoadministration with a high-fat meal slowed down the absorption rate (median tmax 3 h) and \ndecreased the maximum plasma concentration (37 % lower) of brivaracetam, while the extent of \nabsorption remained unchanged. \n \nDistribution \n \nBrivaracetam is weakly bound (≤ 20 %) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg, a \nvalue close to that of the total body water. \nDue to its lipophylicity (Log P) brivaracetam has high cell membrane permeability.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBrivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding \ncarboxylic acid (approximately 60 % the elimination), and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl \nside chain (approximately 30 % the elimination). The hydrolysis of the amide moiety leading to the \ncarboxylic acid metabolite (34 % of the dose in urine) is supported by hepatic and extra-hepatic \namidase. In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Both \nmetabolites, are further metabolised forming a common hydroxylated acid formed predominantly by \nhydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). In vivo, \nin human subjects possessing ineffective mutations of CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy \nmetabolite is decreased 10-fold while brivaracetam itself is increased by 22 % or 42 % in individuals \nwith one or both mutated alleles. The three metabolites are not pharmacologically active. \n \nElimination \n \nBrivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95 % of \nthe dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Less than 1 % of \nthe dose is excreted in faeces and less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted unchanged in urine. The \nterminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance in patients was \nestimated to 3.6 L/h.  \n \nLinearity \n \nPharmacokinetics is dose-proportional from 10 to at least 600 mg. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nBrivaracetam is cleared by multiple pathways including renal excretion, non-CYP-mediated \nhydrolysis and CYP-mediated oxidations. In vitro, brivaracetam is not a substrate of human P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 1 and 2, and likely not organic anion \ntransporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. \nIn vitro assays showed that brivaracetam disposition should not be significantly affected by CYP (eg. \nCYP1A, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4) inhibitors. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nIn vitro, brivaracetam was not an inhibitor of the CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4, or the \ntransporters P-gp, BCRP, BSEP MRP2, MATE-K, MATE-1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and \nOCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A2.  \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nIn a study in elderly subjects (65 to79 years old; with creatinine clearance 53 to 98 ml/min/1.73 m²) \nreceiving brivaracetam 400 mg/day in bid administration, the plasma half-life of brivaracetam was \n7.9 hours and 9.3 hours in the 65 to 75 and >75 years groups, respectively. The steady-state plasma \nclearance of brivaracetam was similar (0.76 ml/min/kg) to young healthy male subjects \n(0.83 ml/min/kg). (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nA study in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min/1.73 m² and not \nrequiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased (+21 %) \nrelative to healthy controls, while the AUC of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites were \nincreased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The renal clearance of these non active metabolites was \ndecreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did not reveal any safety concerns in non clinical \nstudies. Brivaracetam has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grades A, B, and C) showed \nsimilar increases in exposure to brivaracetam irrespective of disease severity (50 %, 57 % and 59 %), \nrelative to matched healthy controls. (see section 4.2) \n \nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration using \nthe brivaracetam oral solution, 99 subjects aged 1 month to <16 years were evaluated. Brivaracetam \nwas administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and \n4 mg/kg/day. All doses were adjusted by body weight, and did not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day, \n100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day. At the end of the evaluation period, subjects may have been eligible for \nentry into a long-term follow-up study continuing on their last received dose (see section 4.8). Plasma \nconcentrations were shown to be dose-proportional in all age groups. Population pharmacokinetics \nmodeling indicated that the dose of 2.0 mg/kg twice a day provides the same steady-state average \nplasma concentration as in adults receiving 100 mg twice daily. The estimated plasma clearance was \n1.61 L/h, 2.18 L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In \ncomparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult patients (70 kg body weight). \nCurrently, no clinical data are available in neonates. \n \nBody weight \n\nA 40 % decrease in steady-state plasma concentration has been estimated across a body weight range \nfrom 46 kg to 115 kg. However, this is not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.  \n \nGender \n\nThere are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam by gender. \n  \nRace \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam was not significantly affected by race (Caucasian, , Asian) in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic modeling from epilepsy patients. The number of patients with other ethnic \nbackground was limited. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship \nThe EC50 (brivaracetam plasma concentration corresponding to 50 % of the maximum effect) was \nestimated to be 0.57 mg/L. This plasma concentration is slightly above the median exposure obtained \nafter brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day. Further seizure frequency reduction is obtained by increasing \nthe dose to 100 mg/day and reaches a plateau at 200 mg/day. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn safety pharmacology studies, the predominant effects were CNS related (mainly transient CNS \ndepression and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity) seen at multiples (greater than 50 fold) of \nthe pharmacologically active dose of brivaracetam, 2 mg/kg. Learning and memory function were not \naffected.  \n \nFindings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the repeated-dose toxicology dog studies at \nexposure similar to the clinical plasma AUC, were hepatotoxic effects (mainly porphyria). However, \ntoxicological data accumulated on brivaracetam and on a structurally-related compound indicate that \nthe dog liver changes have developed through mechanisms not relevant for humans. No adverse liver \nchanges were seen in rats and monkeys following chronic administration of brivaracetam at 5- and 42-\nfold the clinical AUC exposure. In monkeys, CNS signs (prostrate, loss of balance, clumsy \nmovements) occurred at 64 fold the clinical Cmax, these effects being less apparent over time. \n \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Carcinogenicity studies \ndid not indicate any oncogenic potential in rats, whereas increased incidences of hepatocellular tumors \nin male mice are considered to result of a non-genotoxic, mode of action linked to a phenobarbitone-\nlike liver enzyme induction, which is a known rodent specific phenomenon.  \n \nBrivaracetam did not affect male or female fertility and has demonstrated no teratogenic potential in \neither rat or rabbit. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at a maternal toxic dose of brivaracetam \nwith an exposure level 8-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum recommended dose. In rats, \nbrivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of lactating rats with \nconcentrations similar to maternal plasma levels. \n \nBrivaracetam did not show any dependence potential in rats. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \n \n\nIn juvenile rats, brivaracetam exposure levels 6- to 15-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum \nrecommended dose induced developmental adverse effects (i.e. mortality, clinical signs, decreased \nbody weight and lower brain weight). There were no adverse effects on CNS function, \nneuropathological and brain histopathological examination. In juvenile dogs, the brivaracetam-induced \nchanges at the exposure level 6- fold the clinical AUC were similar to those observed in adult animals. \nThere were no adverse effects in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 10mg brivaracetam \nEach 5 ml vial contains 50 mg brivaracetam \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach ml of solution for injection/infusion contains 3.8 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection/infusion (injection/infusion) \nClear, colourless, solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBriviact is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n\nAdults \nBrivaracetam may be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. When converting from \noral to intravenous administration or vice versa, the total daily dose and frequency of administration \nshould be maintained. Brivaracetam solution for injection/infusion is an alternative for patients when \noral administration is temporarily not feasible. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is either 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day based on physician assessment of \nrequired seizure reduction versus potential side effects. The dose should be administered in two \nequally divided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening. Based on individual patient \nresponse and tolerability, the dose may be adjusted in the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  \n \nThere is no experience with twice daily intravenous administration of brivaracetam for a period longer \nthan 4 days. \n \nMissed doses \n\nIf patients missed one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. This may avoid the \nbrivaracetam plasma concentration falling below the efficacy level and prevent breakthrough seizures \nfrom occurring. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \nDiscontinuation \n\nIf brivaracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually by 50 mg/day on a \nweekly basis. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day, a final week of treatment at the dose of \n20 mg/day is recommended. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \nThe clinical experience in patients ≥ 65 years is limited. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). Brivaracetam \nis not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. \nBased on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal \nfunction. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nExposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease. In adults, a \n50 mg/day starting dose should be considered. In children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or greater, a \n50 mg/day starting dose is recommended. A maximum daily dose of 150 mg administered in 2 divided \ndoses is recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2).  \nIn children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg, a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended. \nThe maximum dose should not exceed 3 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric \npatients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nAs in adults, brivaracetam solution for injection/infusion is an alternative route of administration for \npatients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. There is no experience with twice daily \nintravenous administration of brivaracetam for a period longer than 4 days. \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for children from 4 years of age and \nadolescents. More details are provided below the table. \n \n Children (≥4 years) and \n\nadolescents ≥50 kg \n \n\nAdministered in 2 equally divided \ndoses \n\nChildren (≥4 years) and \nadolescents <50 kg \n\n \nAdministered in 2 equally divided \n\ndoses \nTherapeutic dose range 50 - 200 mg/day 1 - 4 mg/kg/day \nRecommended starting dose 50 mg/day   \n\n(or 100 mg/day)* \n1 mg/kg/day \n(or 2 mg/kg/day)* \n\nRecommended maintenance \ndose \n\n100 mg/day 2 mg/kg/day \n\n* Based on physician assessment of need for seizure control. \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more  \nThe recommended starting dose is 50mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based \non physician assessment of need for seizure control. The dose should be administered in two equally \ndivided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening.The recommended maintenance dose is \n100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose \nrange of 50 mg/day and 200 mg/day. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 2 mg/kg/day \nbased on physician assessment of need for seizure control. The dose should be administered in two \nequally divided doses, once in the morning and once in the evening. The recommended maintenance \ndose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective \ndose range of 1 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day. \n \nChildren less than 4 years \n\nThe safety and efficacy of brivaracetam in children aged less than 4 years have not yet been \nestablished. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \n\nMethod of administration  \n \n\n- Intravenous bolus: brivaracetam may be administered as an intravenous bolus without dilution.  \n- Intravenous infusion: brivaracetam may be diluted in a compatible diluent and administered as a \n\n15-minute intravenous infusion (see section 6.6). This medicinal product must not be mixed \nwith other medicinal products. \n\n \nBrivaracetam bolus injection or intravenous infusion has not been studied in acute conditions; e.g. \nstatus epilepticus and is therefore not recommended for such conditions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs \n(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-\ncontrolled trials of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The \nmechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an \nincreased risk for brivaracetam. \nPatients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment \nshould be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice \nshould any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, paediatric data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic \nimpairment. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section \n4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nThe solution for injection/infusion contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per vial, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFormal interaction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \n\nConcomitant treatment with levetiracetam \n\nIn the clinical studies, although the numbers were limited, there was no observed benefit of \nbrivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently. No additional safety or \ntolerability concern was observed (see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single \ndose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects, there was no pharmacokinetic \ninteraction but brivaracetam approximately doubled the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function, \nattention and memory. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of other agents on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam \n\nIn vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway \nof brivaracetam is by CYP-independent hydrolysis. A second disposition pathway involves \nhydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19 (see section 5.2).  \n \nBrivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when coadministered with CYP2C19 strong \ninhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine), but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19-mediated \ninteraction is considered to be low. \n \nRifampicin \n\nIn healthy subjects, coadministration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for \n5 days), decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by \n45 %. Prescribers should consider adjusting the brivaracetam dose in patients starting or ending \ntreatment with rifampicin.  \n \nStrong enzyme inducing AEDs \n\nBrivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when coadministered with strong enzyme inducing \nAEDs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required (see table 1).  \n \nOther enzyme inducers \n\nOther strong enzyme inducers (such as St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also decrease the \nsystemic exposure of brivaracetam. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with St John’s wort should \nbe done with caution. \n \nEffects of brivaracetam on other medicinal products  \nBrivaracetam given 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by \nCYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered to be low. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms \nexcept for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lanzoprazole, omeprazole, diazepam). When tested in vitro \nbrivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. No CYP3A4 induction \nwas found in vivo (see midazolam above). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and \nbrivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 \n(e.g. efavirenz). In vitro, interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters \nconcluded that there were no clinically relevant effects, except for OAT3. In vitro, brivaracetam \ninhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest \nclinical dose. Brivaracetam 200mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products \ntransported by OAT3. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nAntiepileptic drugs \n \nPotential interactions between brivaracetam (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) and other AEDs were \ninvestigated in a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all phase 2-3 studies in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of placebo-controlled phase 2-3 studies, and in dedicated drug-\ndrug interaction studies (for the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and \ntopiramate). The effect of the interactions on the plasma concentration is summarised in table 1 \n(increase is indicated as “↑” and decrease as “↓”, area under the plasma concentration versus time \ncurve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as Cmax).  \n \n\nTable 1: Pharmacokinetic interactions between brivaracetam and other AEDs \n\nAED coadministered Influence of AED on brivaracetam \nplasma concentration \n\nInfluence of brivaracetam on \nAED plasma concentration \n\nCarbamazepine AUC 29 % ↓ \nCmax 13 % ↓ \nNo dose adjustment required \n\nCarbamazepine - None \nCarbamazepine-epoxide ↑ \n(See below)  \nNo dose adjustment required. \n\nClobazam No data available None \nClonazepam No data available None \nLacosamide No data available None  \nLamotrigine None  None  \nLevetiracetam None  None  \nOxcarbazepine  None  None (monohydroxy derivative, \n\nMHD) \nPhenobarbital AUC 19 % ↓ \n\nNo dose adjustment required \nNone  \n\nPhenytoin AUC 21 % ↓ \nNo dose adjustment required \n\nNone \na AUC 20% ↑ \na Cmax 20% ↑ \n\nPregabalin No data available None  \nTopiramate None  None  \nValproic acid None  None  \nZonisamide No data available None  \n\na based on a study involving the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg/day brivaracetam \n \nCarbamazepine  \n\nBrivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase resulting in an increased \nconcentration of carbamazepine epoxide, an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled studies, \nthe carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37 %, 62 % and 98 % with \nlittle variability at brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively. No \nsafety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of \ncarbamazepine epoxide. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nCo-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol \n(0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. \nWhen brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum \ndaily dose) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel \n(0.15 mg), a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27 % and 23 %, respectively, was observed \nwithout impact on suppression of ovulation. There was generally no change in the concentration-time \nprofiles of the endogenous markers estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle \nstimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nPhysicians should discuss family planning and contraception with women of childbearing potential \ntaking brivaracetam (see Pregnancy). \nIf a woman decides to become pregnant, the use of brivaracetam should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nPregnancy \n \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \n\nFor all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the \nprevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3 % in the \ngeneral population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with \npolytherapy; however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible \nhas not been elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the \ndisease which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to brivaracetam \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women. There is no data on \nplacental transfer in humans, but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats (see \nsection 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic \npotential of brivaracetam (see section 5.3). \n \nIn clinical studies, brivaracetam was used as adjunctive therapy and when it was used with \ncarbamazepine, it induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite, \ncarbamazepine-epoxide (see section 4.5). There is insufficient data to determine the clinical \nsignificance of this effect in pregnancy. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically \nnecessary i.e. (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Studies in rats have shown \nexcretion of brivaracetam in breast milk (see section 5.3). A decision should be made whether to \ndiscontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue brivaracetam, taking into account the benefit of the \nmedicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine, the \namount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. There is insufficient data to \ndetermine the clinical significance. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on \nfertility with brivaracetam (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBrivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDue to possible differences in individual sensitivity some patients might experience somnolence, \ndizziness, and other central nervous system (CNS) related symptoms. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of \nbrivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with epilepsy, 2,388 subjects have received \nbrivaracetam, of whom 1,740 have been treated for ≥ 6 months,1,363 for ≥ 12 months, 923 for ≥ \n24 months and 569 for ≥ 60 months (5 years). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10%) with brivaracetam treatment were: somnolence \n(14.3 %) and dizziness (11.0 %). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence and \nfatigue (8.2 %) were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. The types of adverse \nreactions reported during the first 7 days of treatment were similar to those reported for the overall \ntreatment period. \n \nThe discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 3.5 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % for patients randomized \nto brivaracetam at respectively the dose of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and 1.7 % for \npatients randomized to placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently resulting in discontinuation of \nbrivaracetam therapy were dizziness (0.8 %) and convulsion (0.8 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the three placebo-\ncontrolled, fixed-dose studies safety database in subjects ≥ 16 years of age, are listed by System Organ \nClass and frequency.  \nThe frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions from clinical trials \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nCommon Influenza \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Neutropenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon  Decreased appetite \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Type I hypersensitivity \nPsychiatric disorders Common Depression, anxiety, insomnia, irritability \n\nUncommon Suicidal ideation, psychotic disorder, \naggression, agitation \n\nNervous system disorders Very common  Dizziness, somnolence \nCommon \n \n\nConvulsion, vertigo \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon  \n \n\nUpper respiratory tract infections, cough \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon  \n \n\nNausea, vomiting, constipation \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon  \n \n\nFatigue \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nNeutropenia has been reported in 0.5 % (6/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0 % (0/459) placebo \npatients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline, and experienced \nadditional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of brivaracetam treatment. None of the 6 cases \nof neutropenia were severe, required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam \nand none had associated infections. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \nSuicidal ideation has been reported in 0.3 % (3/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0.7 % (3/459) \nplacebo patients. In the short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in epilepsy patients, there were no \ncases of completed suicide and suicide attempt, however both have been reported in open-label \nextension studies(see section 4.4). \n \nReactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of \nbrivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. \n \nAdverse reactions with intravenous administration generally appeared to be similar to those observed \nwith oral administration. Intravenous administration was associated with infusion site pain in 2.8 % of \nthe patients. \n \nOpen-label extension studies \n \nIn patients who were followed up in the open-label extension studies for up to 8 years, the safety \nprofile was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children was consistent with the safety profile observed \nin adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of \npaediatric patients (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural \ndisorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority \nof events were mild or moderate in intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of \nstudy drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity \n(4.7 %).  \n \nThere are limited safety data from open-label studies in children from 1 month to <4 years of age. \nLimited data are available on neurodevelopment in children <4 years of age. No clinical data are \navailable in neonates. \n \nElderly  \n \nOf the 130 elderly subjects enrolled in the brivaracetam phase 2/3 development program (44 with \nepilepsy), 100 were 65-74 years of age and 30 were 75-84 years of age. The safety profile in elderly \npatients appears to be similar to that observed in younger adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness \nhave been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1,400 mg of brivaracetam. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include \ngeneral supportive measures. Since less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted in urine, haemodialysis \nis not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX23  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBrivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a \ntransmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and in endocrine cells. Although \nthe exact role of this protein remains to be elucidated it has been shown to modulate exocytosis of \nneurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for brivaracetam \nanticonvulsant activity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of brivaracetam for the adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures (POS) was established \nin 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, multi-center studies in subjects \n16 years of age and older. The daily dose of brivaracetam ranged from 5 to 200 mg/day across these \nstudies. All studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period with no up-\ntitration. 1,558 patients received study drug of which 1,099 received brivaracetam. Study enrollment \ncriteria required that patients have uncontrolled POS despite treatment with either 1 or 2 concomitant \nAEDs. Patients were required to have at least 8 POS during the baseline period. The primary endpoints \nin the phase 3 studies were the percent reduction in POS frequency over placebo and the 50 % \nresponder rate based on 50 % reduction in POS frequency from baseline. \nThe most commonly taken AEDs at the time of study entry were carbamazepine (40.6 %), lamotrigine \n(25.2 %), valproate (20.5 %), oxcarbazepine (16.0 %), topiramate (13.5 %), phenytoin (10.2 %) and \nlevetiracetam (9.8 %). The median baseline seizure frequency across the 3 studies was 9 seizures per \n28 days. Patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 23 years. \nThe efficacy outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Overall, brivaracetam was efficacious for the \nadjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older between 50 mg/day \nand 200 mg/day.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nTable 2: Key Efficacy Outcomes for Partial Onset Seizure Frequency per 28 Days \n\nStudy \n \n\nPlacebo Brivaracetam  \n* Statistically significant (p-value) \n\n50 mg/day 100 mg/day 200 mg/day \nStudy N01253(1) \n n= 96 n= 101   \n50 % Responder rate 16.7 32.7*  \n\n(p=0.008) \n~ ~ \n\n \nPercent reduction over placebo (%)  NA 22.0*  \n\n(p=0.004) \n~ ~ \n\nStudy N01252(1) \n n = 100 n = 99 n = 100  \n50 % Responder rate  20.0 27.3 \n\n(p=0.372) \n36.0(2) \n(p=0.023) \n\n~ \n \n\nPercent reduction over placebo (%) NA 9.2 \n(p=0.274) \n\n20.5(2) \n(p=0.010) \n\n~ \n \n\nStudy N01358 \n n = 259  n = 252 n = 249 \n50% Responder rate 21.6 ~ 38.9*  \n\n(p<0.001) \n37.8*  \n\n(p<0.001) \nPercent reduction over placebo (%) NA ~ 22.8*  \n\n(p<0.001)  \n23.2*  \n\n(p<0.001) \nn = randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication  \n~ Dose not studied \n* Statistically significant \n(1) Approximately 20 % of the patients were on concomitant levetiracetam  \n(2) The primary outcome for N01252 did not achieve statistical significance based on the sequential \ntesting procedure, The 100 mg/day dose was nominally significant. \n \nIn clinical studies, a reduction in seizure frequency over placebo was higher with the dose of \n100 mg/day than with 50 mg/day. Apart from dose-dependent increases in incidences of somnolence \nand fatigue brivaracetam 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day had a similar safety profile including CNS-\nrelated AEs and with long-term use. \n \nFigure 1 shows the percentage of patients (excluding patients with concomitant levetiracetam) by \ncategory of reduction from baseline in POS frequency per 28 days in all 3 studies. Patients with more \nthan a 25 % increase in POS are shown at left as “worse”. Patients with an improvement in percent \nreduction in baseline POS frequency are shown in the 4 right-most categories. The percentages of \npatients with at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency were 20.3 %, 34.2 %, 39.5 %, and 37.8 % \nfor placebo, 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.   \n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nFigure 1: Proportion of patients by category of seizure response for brivaracetam and placebo over \n12 weeks across all three double-blind pivotal trials \n\n \n \nIn a pooled analysis of the three pivotal trials, no differences in efficacy (measured as 50 % responder \nrate) was observed within the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day when brivaracetam is combined \nwith inducing or non-inducing AEDs. In clinical studies 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 4.0% \n(10/249) of the patients on brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively became \nseizure free during the 12-week treatment period compared with 0.5 % (2/418) on placebo.  \n \nImprovement in the median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days has been observed in \npatients with type IC seizure (secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) at baseline treated with \nbrivaracetam (66.6 % (n=62), 61.2 % (n=100) and 82.1 % (n=75) of the patients on brivaracetam \n50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively as compared to placebo 33.3 % (n=115)).  \n \nThe efficacy of brivaracetam in monotherapy has not been established. Brivaracetam is not \nrecommended for use in monotherapy.  \n \nTreatment with levetiracetam \n \nIn two phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled studies, levetiracetam was administered as concomitant \nAED in about 20 % of the patients. Although the number of subjects is limited, there was no observed \nbenefit of brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently which may reflect \ncompetition at the SV2A binding site. No additional safety or tolerability concerns were observed. \n \nIn a third study, a pre-specified analysis demonstrated efficacy over placebo for 100 mg/day and 200 \nmg/day in patients with prior exposure to levetiracetam. The lower efficacy observed in these patients \ncompared to the leveticacetam-naïve patients was likely due to the higher number of prior AEDs used \nand higher baseline seizure frequency. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nThe three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled studies included 38 elderly patients aged between \n65 and 80 years. Although data are limited, the efficacy was comparable to younger subjects. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nOpen label extension studies \n\nAcross all studies, 81.7 % of the patients who completed randomized studies were enrolled in the \nlong-term open-label extension studies. From entry into the randomized studies,5.3 % of the subjects \nexposed to brivaracetam for 6 months (n=1,500) were seizure free compared to 4.6 % and 3.7 % for \nsubjects exposed for 12 months (n=1,188) and 24 months (n=847), respectively. However, as a high \nproportion of subjects (26%) discontinued from the open-label studies due to lack of efficacy, a \nselection bias may have occurred, as the subjects who stayed in the study responded better than those \nwho have terminated prematurely. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn children aged 4 years and older, partial onset seizures have a similar clinical expression to those in \nadolescents and adults. Experience with epilepsy medicines suggests that the results of efficacy studies \nperformed in adults can be extrapolated to children down to the age of 4 years provided the paediatric \ndose adaptations are established and safety has been demonstrated (see sections 5.2 and 4.8). Doses in \npatients from 4 years of age were defined by weight-based dose adaptations which have been \nestablished to achieve similar plasma concentrations to the ones observed in adults taking efficacious \ndoses (section 5.2).  \n \nA long-term, uncontrolled, open-label safety study included children (from 4 years to less than 16 \nyears) who continued treatment after completing the PK study (see section 5.2) and children directly \nenrolled into the safety study. Children who directly enrolled received a brivaracetam starting dose of \n1 mg/kg/day and depending on response and tolerability, the dose was increased up to 5 mg/kg/day by \ndoubling the dose at weekly intervals. No child received a dose greater than 200 mg/day. For children \nweighing 50 kg or greater the brivaracetam starting dose was 50 mg/day and depending on response \nand tolerability, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 200 mg/day by weekly increments of \n50 mg/day.  \n \nFrom the pooled open-label safety and PK studies in adjunctive therapy, 149 children have received \nbrivaracetam, of whom 116 have been treated for ≥6 months, 107 for ≥12 months, 58 for ≥24 months, \nand 28 for ≥36 months. \n \nThe efficacy and tolerability of brivaracetam in paediatric patients less than 4 years of age have not \nbeen established (see section 4.2). Brivaracetam was evaluated in these patients in a short term open-\nlabel pharmacokinetic study and an ongoing open-label extension study, in 16 subjects from 1 month \nto <4 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nbrivaracetam in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy with partial onset \nseizures. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBrivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution and solution for intravenous injection show the same \nAUC, while the maximum plasma concentration is slightly higher after intravenous administration. \nBrivaracetam exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject \nvariability, and features complete absorption, very low protein binding, renal excretion following \nextensive biotransformation, and pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nAbsorption \n \nBrivaracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and the absolute \nbioavailablity is approximately 100 %. The median tmax for tablets taken without food is 1 hour (tmax \nrange is 0.25 to 3 h).  \nCoadministration with a high-fat meal slowed down the absorption rate (median tmax 3 h) and \ndecreased the maximum plasma concentration (37 % lower) of brivaracetam, while the extent of \nabsorption remained unchanged. \n \nDistribution \n \nBrivaracetam is weakly bound (≤ 20 %) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg, a \nvalue close to that of the total body water. \nDue to its lipophylicity (Log P) brivaracetam has high cell membrane permeability.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBrivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding \ncarboxylic acid (approximately 60 % the elimination), and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl \nside chain (approximately 30 % the elimination). The hydrolysis of the amide moiety leading to the \ncarboxylic acid metabolite (34 % of the dose in urine) is supported by hepatic and extra-hepatic \namidase. In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Both \nmetabolites, are further metabolised forming a common hydroxylated acid formed predominantly by \nhydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). In vivo, \nin human subjects possessing ineffective mutations of CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy \nmetabolite is decreased 10-fold while brivaracetam itself is increased by 22 % or 42 % in individuals \nwith one or both mutated alleles. The three metabolites are not pharmacologically active. \n \nElimination \n \nBrivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95 % of \nthe dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Less than 1 % of \nthe dose is excreted in faeces and less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted unchanged in urine. The \nterminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance in patients was \nestimated to 3.6 L/h.  \n \nLinearity \n \nPharmacokinetics is dose-proportional from 10 to at least 600 mg. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nBrivaracetam is cleared by multiple pathways including renal excretion, non-CYP-mediated \nhydrolysis and CYP-mediated oxidations. In vitro, brivaracetam is not a substrate of human P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 1 and 2, and likely not organic anion \ntransporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. \nIn vitro assays showed that brivaracetam disposition should not be significantly affected by CYP (eg. \nCYP1A, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4) inhibitors. \n \nIn vitro, brivaracetam was not an inhibitor of the CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4, or the \ntransporters P-gp, BCRP, BSEP MRP2, MATE-K, MATE-1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and \nOCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A2.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nIn a study in elderly subjects (65 to79 years old; with creatinine clearance 53 to 98 ml/min/1.73 m²) \nreceiving brivaracetam 400 mg/day in bid administration, the plasma half-life of brivaracetam was \n7.9 hours and 9.3 hours in the 65 to 75 and >75 years groups, respectively. The steady-state plasma \nclearance of brivaracetam was similar (0.76 ml/min/kg) to young healthy male subjects \n(0.83 ml/min/kg). (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nA study in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min/1.73 m² and not \nrequiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased (+21 %) \nrelative to healthy controls, while the AUC of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites were \nincreased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The renal clearance of these non active metabolites was \ndecreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did not reveal any safety concerns in non clinical \nstudies. Brivaracetam has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grades A, B, and C) showed \nsimilar increases in exposure to brivaracetam irrespective of disease severity (50 %, 57 % and 59 %), \nrelative to matched healthy controls. (see section 4.2) \n \nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration using \nthe brivaracetam oral solution, 99 subjects aged 1 month to <16 years were evaluated. Brivaracetam \nwas administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and \n4 mg/kg/day. All doses were adjusted by body weight, and did not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day, \n100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day. At the end of the evaluation period, subjects may have been eligible for \nentry into a long-term follow-up study continuing on their last received dose (see section 4.8). Plasma \nconcentrations were shown to be dose-proportional in all age groups. Population pharmacokinetics \nmodeling indicated that the dose of 2.0 mg/kg twice a day provides the same steady-state average \nplasma concentration as in adults receiving 100 mg twice daily. The estimated plasma clearance was \n1.61 L/h, 2.18 L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In \ncomparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult patients (70 kg body weight).  \nCurrently, no clinical data are available in neonates. \n \nBody weight \n\nA 40 % decrease in steady-state plasma concentration has been estimated across a body weight range \nfrom 46 kg to 115 kg. However, this is not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.  \n \nGender \n\nThere are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam by gender. \n  \nRace \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam was not significantly affected by race (Caucasian, , Asian) in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic modeling from epilepsy patients. The number of patients with other ethnic \nbackground was limited. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship \nThe EC50 (brivaracetam plasma concentration corresponding to 50 % of the maximum effect) was \nestimated to be 0.57 mg/L. This plasma concentration is slightly above the median exposure obtained \nafter brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day. Further seizure frequency reduction is obtained by increasing \nthe dose to 100 mg/day and reaches a plateau at 200 mg/day. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn safety pharmacology studies, the predominant effects were CNS related (mainly transient CNS \ndepression and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity) seen at multiples (greater than 50 fold) of \nthe pharmacologically active dose of brivaracetam, 2 mg/kg. Learning and memory function were not \naffected.  \n \nFindings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the repeated-dose toxicology dog studies at \nexposure similar to the clinical plasma AUC, were hepatotoxic effects (mainly porphyria). However, \ntoxicological data accumulated on brivaracetam and on a structurally-related compound indicate that \nthe dog liver changes have developed through mechanisms not relevant for humans. No adverse liver \nchanges were seen in rats and monkeys following chronic administration of brivaracetam at 5- and 42-\nfold the clinical AUC exposure. In monkeys, CNS signs (prostrate, loss of balance, clumsy \nmovements) occurred at 64 fold the clinical Cmax, these effects being less apparent over time. \n \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Carcinogenicity studies \ndid not indicate any oncogenic potential in rats, whereas increased incidences of hepatocellular tumors \nin male mice are considered to result of a non-genotoxic, mode of action linked to a phenobarbitone-\nlike liver enzyme induction, which is a known rodent specific phenomenon.  \n \nBrivaracetam did not affect male or female fertility and has demonstrated no teratogenic potential in \neither rat or rabbit. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at a maternal toxic dose of brivaracetam \nwith an exposure level 8-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum recommended dose. In rats, \nbrivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of lactating rats with \nconcentrations similar to maternal plasma levels. \n \nBrivaracetam did not show any dependence potential in rats. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \n \n\nIn juvenile rats, brivaracetam exposure levels 6- to 15-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum \nrecommended dose induced developmental adverse effects (i.e. mortality, clinical signs, decreased \nbody weight and lower brain weight). There were no adverse effects on CNS function, \nneuropathological and brain histopathological examination. In juvenile dogs, the brivaracetam-induced \nchanges at the exposure level 6- fold the clinical AUC were similar to those observed in adult animals. \nThere were no adverse effects in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints. \n \n \n6.
