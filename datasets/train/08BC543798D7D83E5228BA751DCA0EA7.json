This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGenvoya 150 mg/150 mg/200 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine and \ntenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 61 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nGreen, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 19 mm x 8.5 mm, debossed with \u201cGSI\u201d on \none side of the tablet and \u201c510\u201d on the other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nGenvoya is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection without \nany known mutations associated with resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or \ntenofovir as follows: \n\u2022 In adults and adolescents aged from 12 years and with body weight at least 35 kg \n\u2022 In children aged from 6 years and with body weight at least 25 kg for whom alternative \n\nregimens are unsuitable due to toxicities. \nSee sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and paediatric patients aged 6 years and older, weighing at least 25 kg \nOne tablet to be taken once daily with food. \n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Genvoya within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Genvoya with food as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a \npatient misses a dose of Genvoya by more than 18 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose \nand simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Genvoya another tablet should be taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Genvoya is required in elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Genvoya is required in adults or adolescents (aged at least 12 years and of at \nleast 35 kg body weight) with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 30 mL/min.  Genvoya should be \ndiscontinued in patients with estimated CrCl that declines below 30 mL/min during treatment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nNo dose adjustment of Genvoya is required in adults with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis; however, Genvoya should generally be avoided but \nmay be used in these patients if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  On days of haemodialysis, Genvoya should be administered after \ncompletion of haemodialysis treatment. \n \nGenvoya should be avoided in patients with estimated CrCl \u2265 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min, or \n< 15 mL/min who are not on chronic haemodialysis, as the safety of Genvoya has not been established \nin these populations. \n \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations in children aged less than 12 years with renal \nimpairment or in children less than 18 years with end stage renal disease. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Genvoya is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.  Genvoya has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, Genvoya is not recommended for use in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Genvoya in children younger than 6 years of age, or weighing < 25 kg, have \nnot yet been established.  No data are available. \n \nPregnancy \nTreatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir during pregnancy results in lower elvitegravir exposure (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).  Therefore, therapy with Genvoya should not be initiated during pregnancy, and \nwomen who become pregnant during therapy with Genvoya should be switched to an alternative \nregimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGenvoya should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should \nnot be chewed or crushed.  For patients who are unable to swallow the tablet whole, the tablet may be \nsplit in half and both halves taken one after the other, ensuring that the full dose is taken. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for \nclearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious or life-threatening \nadverse reactions.  Therefore, Genvoya should not be co-administered with medicinal products that \ninclude, but are not limited to, the following (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): \n \n\u2022 alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists: alfuzosin \n\u2022 antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine \n\u2022 ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n\u2022 gastrointestinal motility agents: cisapride \n\u2022 HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin \n\u2022 neuroleptics/antipsychotics: pimozide, lurasidone \n\u2022 PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension \n\u2022 sedatives/hypnotics: orally administered midazolam, triazolam \n \nCo-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A due \nto the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Genvoya.  Therefore, Genvoya \nshould not be co-administered with medicinal products that include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): \n \n\u2022 anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n\u2022 antimycobacterials: rifampicin \n\u2022 herbal products: St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \nCo-administration with dabigatran etexilate, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Genvoya in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) \nhave not been established. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Discontinuation of Genvoya therapy \nin patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of \nhepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue Genvoya should be closely \nmonitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping \ntreatment. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Genvoya in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not \nbeen established. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactataemia, hyperlipasaemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset \nneurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  \nWhether such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings \nshould be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with \nsevere clinical findings of unknown aetiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not \naffect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent \nvertical transmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis \njirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable, and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients receiving Genvoya or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \n \nPatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \n \nGenvoya should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease \n(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the \npotential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of Genvoya in HIV-1 infected adults with end stage renal \ndisease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was maintained through \n48 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with normal renal \nfunction.  Although there were no new safety issues identified, the implications of increased \nemtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nSome medicinal products should not be co-administered with Genvoya (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nGenvoya should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \nGenvoya should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment of \nHBV infection (see section 4.5). \n \nContraception requirements \nFemale patients of childbearing potential should use either a hormonal contraceptive containing at \nleast 30 \u00b5g ethinyloestradiol and containing drospirenone or norgestimate as the progestogen or should \nuse an alternative reliable method of contraception (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  The use of Genvoya \nwith oral contraceptives containing other progestogens should be avoided (see section 4.5).  Plasma \nconcentrations of drospirenone are expected to be increased following co-administration with \nGenvoya and clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalaemia (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn a clinical study (GS-US-292-0106) in which Genvoya was administered to 23 HIV-1 infected \npaediatric patients with a mean age of 10 years (range 8 to 11 years), the mean exposures of \nelvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and tenofovir alafenamide were higher (20 to 80%) \nthan the mean exposures achieved in adults (see sections 4.1 and 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nTreatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has \nbeen shown to result in lower elvitegravir exposures (see section 5.2).  Cobicistat levels decrease and \nmay not provide sufficient boosting.  The substantial reduction in elvitegravir exposure may result in \nvirological failure and an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Therefore, \ntherapy with Genvoya should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant \nduring therapy with Genvoya should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \n \nExcipients \n \nGenvoya contains lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nGenvoya should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products.  Therefore, \ninformation regarding drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral products (including protease \ninhibitors [PIs] and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]) is not provided (see \nsection 4.4).  Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nGenvoya should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment of \nHBV infection. \n \nElvitegravir \n \nElvitegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit \nCYP3A may affect the exposure of elvitegravir.  Co-administration of Genvoya with medicinal \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nproducts that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of elvitegravir and \nreduced therapeutic effect of Genvoya (see \u201cConcomitant use contraindicated\u201d and section 4.3).  \nElvitegravir may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 and/or inducible uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes; as such it may decrease the plasma concentration of \nsubstrates of these enzymes. \n \nCobicistat \n \nCobicistat is a strong mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A and is also a CYP3A substrate.  Cobicistat \nis also a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6.  Medicinal \nproducts that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of cobicistat, resulting in increased plasma \nconcentrations of cobicistat. \n \nMedicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism and have high first pass \nmetabolism are the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when co-administered with \ncobicistat (see \u201cConcomitant use contraindicated\u201d and section 4.3). \n \nCobicistat is an inhibitor of the following transporters: P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), \norganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3.  Co-administration with \nmedicinal products that are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in \nincreased plasma concentrations of these products. \n \nEmtricitabine \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-gp and BCRP.  Medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp \nand BCRP activity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption.  However, upon \nco-administration with cobicistat in Genvoya, near maximal inhibition of P-gp by cobicistat is \nachieved leading to increased availability of tenofovir alafenamide with resulting exposures \ncomparable to tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg administered alone.  As such, tenofovir alafenamide \nexposures following administration of Genvoya are not expected to be further increased when used in \ncombination with another P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole).  Based on data from an \nin vitro study, co-administration of tenofovir alafenamide and xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., \nfebuxostat) is not expected to increase systemic exposure to tenofovir in vivo.  In vitro and clinical \npharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for CYP-mediated \ninteractions involving tenofovir alafenamide with other medicinal products is low.  Tenofovir \nalafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6.  \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo.  Tenofovir alafenamide is a \nsubstrate of OATP in vitro.  Inhibitors of OATP and BCRP include ciclosporin. \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \n \nCo-administration of Genvoya and some medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A \nmay result in increased plasma concentrations of these products, which are associated with the \npotential for serious or life-threatening adverse reactions such as peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia \n(e.g., dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergometrine), or myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (e.g., \nsimvastatin, lovastatin), or prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression (e.g., orally \nadministered midazolam or triazolam).  Co-administration of Genvoya and other medicinal products \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A such as amiodarone, quinidine, cisapride, pimozide, lurasidone, \nalfuzosin and sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \nCo-administration of Genvoya and some medicinal products that induce CYP3A such as St. John\u2019s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin may result in \nsignificantly decreased cobicistat and elvitegravir plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of \ntherapeutic effect and development of resistance (see section 4.3). \n \nOther interactions \n \nCobicistat and tenofovir alafenamide are not inhibitors of human UGT1A1 in vitro.  It is not known \nwhether cobicistat, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide are inhibitors of other UGT enzymes. \n \nInteractions between the components of Genvoya and potential co-administered medicinal products \nare listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d).  The \ninteractions described are based on studies conducted with Genvoya, or the components of Genvoya \n(elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide), as individual agents and/or in \ncombination, or are potential drug-drug interactions that may occur with Genvoya. \n \nTable 1: Interactions between the individual components of Genvoya and other medicinal \nproducts \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\nEffects on medicinal product \nlevels. \n\nMean percent change in AUC, \nCmax, Cmin1 \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with Genvoya \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntifungals \nKetoconazole (200 mg twice \ndaily)/ Elvitegravir (150 mg once \ndaily)2 \n\nElvitegravir: \nAUC: \u2191 48% \nCmin: \u2191 67% \nCmax: \u2194 \n \nConcentrations of ketoconazole \nand/or cobicistat may increase with \nco-administration of Genvoya. \n\nWhen administering with Genvoya, \nthe maximum daily dose of \nketoconazole should not exceed \n200 mg per day.

However, a large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 exposed outcomes) \nindicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of elvitegravir, cobicistat, or \nemtricitabine, administered separately, with respect to fertility parameters, pregnancy, foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development.  Studies of tenofovir alafenamide in animals have \nshown no evidence of harmful effects of tenofovir alafenamide on fertility parameters, pregnancy, or \nfoetal development (see section 5.3). \n \nTreatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has \nbeen shown to result in lower elvitegravir exposure (see section 5.2).  Cobicistat levels decrease and \nmay not provide sufficient boosting.  The substantial reduction in elvitegravir exposure may result in \nvirological failure and an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.   Therefore, \ntherapy with Genvoya should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant \nduring therapy with Genvoya should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether elvitegravir, cobicistat, or tenofovir alafenamide are excreted in human milk.  \nEmtricitabine is excreted in human milk.  In animal studies it has been shown that elvitegravir, \ncobicistat, and tenofovir are excreted in milk. \n \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir \nin newborns/infants.  Therefore, Genvoya should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on fertility from the use of Genvoya in humans.  In animal studies there were no \neffects of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide on mating or fertility \nparameters (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with Genvoya. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which \n2,396 patients received Genvoya and from post-marketing experience.  The most frequently reported \nadverse reactions in clinical studies through 144 weeks were nausea (11%), diarrhoea (7%), and \nheadache (6%) (pooled data from Phase 3 clinical studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 in \n866 treatment-na\u00efve adult patients receiving Genvoya). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are \ndefined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: anaemia1 \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: abnormal dreams \n\nUncommon: suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness), depression2 \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: headache, dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: nausea \nCommon: diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence \nUncommon: dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: rash \nUncommon: angioedema3,4, pruritus, urticaria4 \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \n\n1 This adverse reaction was not observed in the Phase 3 clinical studies for Genvoya but identified from clinical studies or \npost-marketing experience for emtricitabine when used with other antiretrovirals. \n\n2 This adverse reaction was not observed in the Phase 3 clinical studies for Genvoya but identified from clinical studies for \nelvitegravir when used with other antiretrovirals. \n\n3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for emtricitabine-containing products. \n4 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable, and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nChanges in serum creatinine \nCobicistat increases serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without \naffecting renal glomerular function.  In clinical studies of Genvoya, increases in serum creatinine \noccurred by Week 2 of treatment and remained stable through 144 weeks.  In treatment-na\u00efve patients, \na mean change from baseline of 0.04 \u00b1 0.12 mg/dL (3.5 \u00b1 10.6 \u00b5mol/L) was observed after 144 weeks \nof treatment.  Mean increases from baseline in the Genvoya group were smaller than in the elvitegravir \n150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg \n(E/C/F/TDF) group at Week 144 (difference -0.04, p < 0.001). \n \nChanges in lipid laboratory tests \nIn studies in treatment-na\u00efve patients, increases from baseline were observed in both treatment groups \nfor the fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and \nhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144.  The median increase from \nbaseline for those parameters was greater in the Genvoya group compared with the E/C/F/TDF group \nat Week 144 (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct \nLDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides).  The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in total \ncholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio at Week 144 was 0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) in the Genvoya group and 0.1 \n(-0.4, 0.6) in the E/C/F/TDF group (p = 0.006 for the difference between treatment groups). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of Genvoya was evaluated through 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected adolescent patients between \nthe ages of 12 to < 18 years weighing \u2265 35 kg, who were either treatment-na\u00efve (GS-US-292-0106, \nn = 50), or who were virologically suppressed (GS-US-292-1515, n = 50), and in virologically \nsuppressed children between the ages of 8 to < 12 years weighing > 25 kg (GS-US-292-0106, n = 23).  \nThe safety profile in paediatric patients who received treatment with Genvoya was similar to that in \nadults. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe safety of Genvoya in 248 HIV-1 infected patients who were either treatment-na\u00efve (n = 6) or \nvirologically suppressed (n = 242) with mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate by Cockcroft-Gault method [eGFRCG]: 30-69 mL/min) was evaluated through 144 weeks \nin an open-label clinical study (GS-US-292-0112).  The safety profile of Genvoya in patients with \nmild to moderate renal impairment was similar to that in patients with normal renal function (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nThe safety of Genvoya in 55 virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients with end stage renal \ndisease (eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis was evaluated through 48 weeks in a single \narm, open-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1825).  There were no new safety issues identified in \npatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis receiving Genvoya (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nThe safety of Genvoya was evaluated in 72 HIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving treatment for \nHIV in an open-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1249), through Week 48, in which patients were \nswitched from another antiretroviral regimen (which included tenofovir disoproxil in 69 of \n72 patients) to Genvoya.  Based on these limited data, the safety profile of Genvoya in patients with \nHIV/HBV co-infection was similar to that in patients with HIV-1 monoinfection. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment \nof overdose with Genvoya consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs \nas well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nAs elvitegravir and cobicistat are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they would be \nsignificantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  Emtricitabine can be removed by \nhaemodialysis, which removes approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose over a 3 hour dialysis \nperiod starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing.  Tenofovir is efficiently removed by \nhaemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54%.  It is not known whether \nemtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations.  ATC code: J05AR18. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nElvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  Integrase is an HIV-1 encoded \nenzyme that is required for viral replication.  Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of HIV-1 \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into host genomic DNA, blocking the formation of the HIV-1 provirus \nand propagation of the viral infection. \n \nCobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes of the \nCYP3A subfamily.  Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic \nexposure of CYP3A substrates, such as elvitegravir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is \nshortened by CYP3A-dependent metabolism. \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and nucleoside analogue of \n2\u2019-deoxycytidine.  Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine \ntriphosphate.  Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral \nDNA by the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), which results in DNA chain-termination.  Emtricitabine \nhas activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and phosphonamidate \nprodrug of tenofovir (2\u2019-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).  Tenofovir alafenamide is \npermeable into cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through \nhydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir disoproxil in \nconcentrating tenofovir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (including lymphocytes and \nother HIV target cells) and macrophages.  Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the \npharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits \nHIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA \nchain-termination.  Tenofovir has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nElvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity in \ncell culture.  Antiviral synergy was maintained for elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir \nalafenamide when tested in the presence of cobicistat. \n \nThe antiviral activity of elvitegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cells, monocyte/macrophage cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes and the \n50% effective concentration (EC50) values were in the range of 0.02 to 1.7 nM.  Elvitegravir displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged \nfrom 0.1 to 1.3 nM) and activity against HIV-2 (EC50 of 0.53 nM). \n \nCobicistat has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV-1 and does not antagonise the antiviral \neffects of elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir. \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs.  The EC50 values for emtricitabine \nwere in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 \u00b5M.  Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture \nagainst HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.075 \u00b5M) and \nshowed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 \u00b5M). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 \nsubtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells \nand CD4+-T lymphocytes.  The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to \n14.7 nM.  Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups \n(M, N, and O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) \nand showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM). \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro \nReduced susceptibility to elvitegravir is most commonly associated with the primary integrase \nmutations T66I, E92Q, and Q148R.  Additional integrase mutations observed in cell culture selection \nincluded H51Y, F121Y, S147G, S153Y, E157Q, and R263K.  HIV-1 with the raltegravir-selected \nsubstitutions T66A/K, Q148H/K, and N155H showed cross-resistance to elvitegravir. \n \nNo in vitro resistance can be demonstrated with cobicistat due to its lack of antiviral activity. \n \nReduced susceptibility to emtricitabine is associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide express a K65R mutation in \nHIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been transiently observed.  HIV-1 isolates \nwith the K65R mutation have low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir, \nand lamivudine. \n \nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients \nIn a pooled analysis, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from antiretroviral-na\u00efve \npatients receiving Genvoya in Phase 3 studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 with \nHIV-1 RNA \u2265 400 copies/mL at confirmed virologic failure, Week 144, or time of early study drug \ndiscontinuation.  Up to Week 144, the development of one or more primary elvitegravir, emtricitabine, \nor tenofovir alafenamide resistance-associated mutations was observed in HIV-1 isolates from 12 of \n22 patients with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and Genvoya treatment-failure isolates \n(12 of 866 patients [1.4%]) compared with 12 of 20 treatment-failure isolates from patients with \nevaluable genotypic data in the E/C/F/TDF treatment group (12 of 867 patients [1.4%]).  Of the \nHIV-1 isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in the Genvoya group, the mutations that \nemerged were M184V/I (n = 11) and K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), \nQ148Q/R (n = 1) and N155H (n = 2) in integrase.  Of the HIV-1 isolates from 12 patients with \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nresistance development in the E/C/F/TDF group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 9), \nK65R/N (n = 4), and L210W (n = 1) in RT and E92Q/V (n = 4), and Q148R (n = 2), and N155H/S \n(n = 3) in integrase.  Most HIV-1 isolates from patients in both treatment groups who developed \nresistance mutations to elvitegravir developed resistance mutations to both emtricitabine and \nelvitegravir. \n \nIn phenotypic analyses of patients in the final resistance analysis population, 7 of 22 patients (32%) \nhad HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir in the Genvoya group compared with \nHIV-1 isolates from 7 of 20 patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group, HIV-1 isolates from 8 patients \n(36%) had reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine in the Genvoya group compared with HIV-1 isolates \nfrom 7 patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group.  One patient in the Genvoya group (1 of 22 [4.5%]) \nand 2 patients in the E/C/F/TDF group (2 of 20 [10%]) had reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nIn virologically suppressed patients \nThree patients with emergent HIV-1 resistance to Genvoya were identified (M184M/I; M184I+E92G; \nM184V+E92Q) up to Week 96 in a clinical study of virologically suppressed patients who switched \nfrom a regimen containing emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and a third agent (GS-US-292-0109, \nn = 959). \n \nIn patients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nIn a clinical study of HIV virologically suppressed patients co-infected with chronic hepatitis B, who \nreceived Genvoya for 48 weeks (GS-US-292-1249, n = 72), 2 patients qualified for resistance analysis.  \nIn these 2 patients, no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to any of the components of \nGenvoya were identified in HIV-1 or HBV. \n \nCross-resistance in HIV-1 infected, treatment-na\u00efve or virologically suppressed patients \nElvitegravir-resistant viruses show varying degrees of cross-resistance to the INSTI raltegravir \ndepending on the type and number of mutations.  Viruses expressing the T66I/A mutations maintain \nsusceptibility to raltegravir, while most other patterns showed reduced susceptibility to raltegravir.  \nViruses expressing elvitegravir or raltegravir resistance mutations maintain susceptibility to \ndolutegravir. \n \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. \n \nThe K65R and K70E mutations result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine. \n \nClinical data \n \nHIV-1 infected, treatment-na\u00efve patients \nIn studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive \neither Genvoya (n = 866) once daily or elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine \n200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (E/C/F/TDF) (n = 867) once daily.  The mean age \nwas 36 years (range 18-76), 85% were male, 57% were White, 25% were Black, and 10% were Asian.  \nNineteen percent of patients were identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline plasma \nHIV-1 RNA was 4.5 log10 copies/mL (range 1.3-7.0) and 23% had baseline viral loads \n> 100,000 copies/mL.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 427 cells/mm3 (range 0-1,360) and \n13% had a CD4+ cell count < 200 cells/mm3. \n \nGenvoya demonstrated statistical superiority in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when \ncompared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144.  The difference in percentage was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to \n7.8%).

At screening, 42% of patients were receiving FTC/tenofovir disoproxil plus atazanavir \n(boosted by either cobicistat or ritonavir), 32% of patients were receiving E/C/F/TDF, and 26% of \npatients were receiving EFV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nSwitching from a tenofovir disoproxil-based regimen to Genvoya was superior in maintaining \nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL compared to staying on the baseline regimen (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Virologic outcomes of Study GS-US-292-0109 at Weeks 48a and 96b \n \n\n Week 48 Week 96 \n\n Genvoya (n = 959) \nBaseline regimen \n\n(n = 477) \nGenvoya \n(n = 959) \n\nBaseline regimen \n(n = 477) \n\nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL 97% 93% 93% 89% \nTreatment difference 4.1% (95% CI: 1.6% to 6.7%, \n\np < 0.001c) \n3.7% (95% CI: 0.4% to 7.0%,  \n\np < 0.017c) \nHIV-1 RNA \u2265 50 copies/mLd 1% 1% 2% 2% \nNo virologic data at Week 48/ \nWeek 96 window 2% 6% 5% 9% \n\nDiscontinued study drug due \nto AE or deathe 1% 1% 1% 3% \n\nDiscontinued study drug due \nto other reasons and last \navailable HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mLf \n\n1% 4% 3% 6% \n\nMissing data during window \nbut on study drug 0% < 1% 1% < 1% \n\nProportion (%) of patients \nwith HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL by prior \ntreatment regimen \n\n    \n\nEFV/FTC/tenofovir \ndisoproxil 96% 90% 90% 86% \n\nFTC/tenofovir disoproxil \nplus boosted atazanavir 97% 92% 92% 88% \n\nE/C/F/TDF 98% 97% 96% 93% \nEFV = efavirenz; FTC = emtricitabine; E/C/F/TDF = elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \na Week 48 window was between Day 294 and 377 (inclusive). \nb Week 96 window was between Day 630 and 713 (inclusive). \nc P-value for the superiority test comparing the percentages of virologic success was from the CMH test stratified by the \n\nprior treatment regimen (EFV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil, FTC/tenofovir disoproxil plus boosted atazanavir, or \nE/C/F/TDF). \n\nd Includes patients who had \u2265 50 copies/mL in the Week 48 or Week 96 window; patients who discontinued early due to \nlack or loss of efficacy; patients who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event (AE), death or lack or loss of \nefficacy and at the time of discontinuation had a viral value of \u2265 50 copies/mL. \n\ne Includes patients who discontinued due to AE or death at any time point from Day 1 through the time window if this \nresulted in no virologic data on treatment during the specified window. \n\nf Includes patients who discontinued for reasons other than an AE, death or lack or loss of efficacy; e.g., withdrew consent, \nloss to follow-up, etc. \n\n \nHIV-1 infected patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \nIn Study GS-US-292-0112, the efficacy and safety of Genvoya were evaluated in an open-label \nclinical study of 242 HIV-1 infected patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFRCG: \n30-69 mL/min).  Patients were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least \n6 months before switching to Genvoya.  The mean age was 58 years (range 24-82), with 63 patients \n(26%) who were \u2265 65 years of age.  Seventy-nine percent were male, 63% were White, 18% were \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nBlack, and 14% were Asian.  Thirteen percent of patients were identified as Hispanic/Latino.  At \nbaseline, 80 patients (33%) had eGFRCG < 50 mL/min and 162 patients had eGFRCG \u2265 50 mL/min.  At \nbaseline, median eGFR was 56 mL/min.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 664 cells/mm3 \n(range 126-1,813). \n \nAt Week 144, 83.1% (197/237 patients) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to \nGenvoya. \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-1825, the efficacy and safety of Genvoya were evaluated in a single-arm, \nopen-label clinical study in which 55 HIV-1 infected adults with end stage renal disease \n(eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis for at least 6 months before switching to Genvoya.  \nPatients were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months before \nswitching to Genvoya. \n \nThe mean age was 48 years (range 23-64).  Seventy-six percent were male, 82% were Black and 18% \nwere White.  Fifteen percent of patients identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell \ncount was 545 cells/mm3 (range 205-1473).  At Week 48, 81.8% (45/55 patients) maintained HIV-1 \nRNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to Genvoya.  There were no clinically significant changes in \nfasting lipid laboratory tests in patients who switched to Genvoya. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nIn open-label Study GS-US-292-1249, the efficacy and safety of Genvoya were evaluated in adult \npatients co-infected with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B.  Sixty-nine of the 72 patients were on prior \ntenofovir disoproxil-containing antiretroviral therapy.  At the start of treatment with Genvoya, the \n72 patients had been HIV suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months with or \nwithout suppression of HBV DNA and had compensated liver function.  The mean age was 50 years \n(range 28-67), 92% of patients were male, 69% were White, 18% were Black, and 10% were Asian.  \nThe mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 636 cells/mm3 (range 263-1,498).  Eighty-six percent of \npatients (62/72) were HBV suppressed (HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL) and 42% (30/72) were \nHBeAg positive at baseline. \n \nOf the patients who were HBeAg positive at baseline, 1/30 (3.3%) achieved seroconversion to \nanti-HBe at Week 48.  Of the patients who were HBsAg positive at baseline, 3/70 (4.3%) achieved \nseroconversion to anti-HBs at Week 48. \n \nAt Week 48, 92% of patients (66/72) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to \nGenvoya.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was -2 cells/mm3.  \nNinety-two percent (66/72 patients) had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL using missing = failure analysis at \nWeek 48.  Of the 62 patients who were HBV suppressed at baseline, 59 remained suppressed and \n3 had missing data.  Of the 10 patients who were not HBV suppressed at baseline \n(HBV DNA \u2265 29 IU/mL), 7 became suppressed, 2 remained detectable, and 1 had missing data. \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of Genvoya in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are \ntreatment-na\u00efve. \n \nChanges in measures of bone mineral density \nIn studies in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Genvoya was associated with smaller reductions in bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF as measured by DXA analysis of hip (mean change: -0.8% \nversus -3.4%, p < 0.001) and lumbar spine (mean change: -0.9% versus -3.0%, p < 0.001) after \n144 weeks of treatment. \n \nImprovements in BMD were noted at 96 weeks after switching to Genvoya from a tenofovir \ndisoproxil-containing regimen compared to maintaining the tenofovir disoproxil-containing regimen. \n \nChanges in measures of renal function \nIn studies in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Genvoya was associated with a lower impact on renal safety \nparameters (as measured after 144 weeks treatment by estimated glomerular filtration rate by \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nCockcroft-Gault method, and urine protein to creatinine ratio and after 96 weeks treatment by urine \nalbumin to creatinine ratio) compared to E/C/F/TDF (see also section 4.4).  Through 144 weeks of \ntreatment, no subject discontinued Genvoya due to a treatment-emergent renal adverse event \ncompared with 12 subjects who discontinued E/C/F/TDF (p < 0.001). \n \nAn improved renal safety profile was maintained through Week 96 in patients who switched to \nGenvoya compared with those who stayed on a tenofovir disoproxil-containing regimen. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nStudy GS-US-292-0106 \nIn Study GS-US-292-0106, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Genvoya were evaluated in \nan open-label study in HIV-1 infected, treatment-na\u00efve adolescents between the ages of 12 to \n< 18 years, weighing \u2265 35 kg (n = 50) in Cohort 1, and in virologically suppressed children between \nthe ages of 8 to < 12 years, weighing > 25 kg (n = 23) in Cohort 2. \n \nPatients in Cohort 1 had a mean age of 15 years (range 12 to 17), were 44% male, 12% Asian, and \n88% Black.  At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count \nwas 456 cells/mm3 (range: 95 to 1,110), and median CD4+% was 23% (range: 7 to 45%).  Overall, \n22% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/mL. \n \nAt Week 48, the virologic response rate to Genvoya in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adolescents \nwas similar to response rates in studies of treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adults.  In patients treated \nwith Genvoya, 92% (46/50) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL.  The mean increase from baseline \nin CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 224 cells/mm3.  Three patients had virologic failure at Week 48; \nthere was no virologic resistance detected to Genvoya. \n \nPatients in Cohort 2 had a mean age of 10 years (range: 8 to 11), a mean baseline weight of 32 kg \n(range: 26 to 58), were 39% male, 13% Asian, and 78% Black.  At baseline, median CD4+ cell count \nwas 969 cells/mm3 (range: 603 to 1,421), and median CD4+% was 39% (range: 30 to 51%). \n \nAfter switching to Genvoya, 100% (23/23) of patients in Cohort 2 remained suppressed (HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL) at Week 48.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count and percentage at \nWeek 48 was -90 cells/mm3 and -1.3%, respectively.  No patient qualified for resistance analysis \nthrough Week 48. \n \nStudy GS-US-292-1515 \nIn Study GS-US-292-1515, the efficacy and safety of Genvoya were evaluated in an open-label study \nin HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years, weighing \n\u2265 35 kg (n = 50). \n \nPatients in the study had a median age of 15 years (range: 12 to 17 years), 64% were female and 98% \nwere Black.  At baseline, median CD4+ cell count was 742 cells/mm3 (range: 255 to 1,246) and \nmedian CD4+% was 34% (range: 21 to 53%). \n \nAfter switching to Genvoya, 90% (45/50) of patients remained suppressed (HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL) at Week 48.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count and percentage at \nWeek 48 was -43 cells/mm3 and -0.1%, respectively.  Five subjects had virologic failure through the \nend of the study; no phenotypic or genotypic resistance to Genvoya was detected. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nGenvoya in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of human \nHIV-1 infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration with food in HIV-1 infected patients, peak plasma concentrations were \nobserved approximately 4 hours post-dose for elvitegravir, 3 hours post-dose for cobicistat, 3 hours \npost-dose for emtricitabine, and 1 hour post-dose for tenofovir alafenamide.  The steady-state mean \nCmax, AUCtau, and Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) in HIV-1 infected patients, respectively, were 1.7 \u00b1 0.39 \u00b5g/mL, \n23 \u00b1 7.5 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, and 0.45 \u00b1 0.26 \u00b5g/mL for elvitegravir, which provides inhibitory quotient of ~10 \n(ratio of Ctrough: protein binding-adjusted IC95 for wild-type HIV-1 virus).  Corresponding steady-state \nmean Cmax, AUCtau, and Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) were 1.1 \u00b1 0.40 \u00b5g/mL, 8.3 \u00b1 3.8 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, and \n0.05 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b5g/mL for cobicistat; 1.9 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, 13 \u00b1 4.5 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, and 0.14 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b5g/mL for \nemtricitabine.  Steady-state mean Cmax and AUCtau for tenofovir alafenamide were 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b5g/mL \nand 0.21 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, respectively. \n \nFor elvitegravir, Cmax and AUC increased 22% and 36% with a light meal, and 56% and 91% with a \nhigh-fat meal, relative to fasting conditions.  Cobicistat exposures were unaffected by a light meal and \nalthough there was a modest decrease of 24% and 18% in Cmax and AUC respectively with a high-fat \nmeal, no difference was observed in its pharmacoenhancing effect on elvitegravir.  Emtricitabine \nexposures were unaffected by a light or high-fat meal.  Relative to fasting conditions, the \nadministration of Genvoya with a light meal (~400 kcal, 20% fat) or high-fat meal (~800 kcal, 50% \nfat) did not affect overall exposures of tenofovir alafenamide to a clinically meaningful extent \n(approximately 15% and 18% higher AUC with a light or high-fat meal, respectively, versus fasted). \n \nDistribution \n \nElvitegravir is 98-99% bound to human plasma proteins and binding is independent of drug \nconcentration over the range of 1 ng/mL to 1.6 \u00b5g/mL.  The mean plasma to blood drug concentration \nratio was 1.37. \n \nCobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood drug \nconcentration ratio was 2. \n \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02-200 \u00b5g/mL.  At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to \nblood drug concentration ratio was ~1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio \nwas ~4.0. \n \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration \nover the range of 0.01-25 \u00b5g/mL.  Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins \nin samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nElvitegravir undergoes primarily oxidative metabolism via CYP3A, and is secondarily glucuronidated \nvia UGT1A1/3 enzymes.  Following oral administration of boosted [14C]-elvitegravir, elvitegravir was \nthe predominant species in plasma, representing ~94% of the circulating radioactivity.  Aromatic and \naliphatic hydroxylation or glucuronidation metabolites are present in very low levels, displaying \nconsiderably lower antiviral activity against HIV-1 and do not contribute to the overall antiviral \nactivity of elvitegravir. \n \nCobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not \nundergo glucuronidation.  Following oral administration of [14C]-cobicistat, 99% of circulating \nradioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that emtricitabine is not an inhibitor of human CYP enzymes.  Following \nadministration of [14C]-emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was achieved in \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nurine (~86%) and faeces (~14%).  Thirteen percent of the dose was recovered in the urine as three \nputative metabolites.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to \nform the 3\u2019-sulfoxide diastereomers (~9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form \n2\u2019-O-glucuronide (~4% of dose).  No other metabolites were identifiable. \n \nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target \ncells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is \nhydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active \nmetabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  In human clinical studies, a 10 mg oral dose of tenofovir \nalafenamide in Genvoya resulted in tenofovir diphosphate concentrations > 4-fold higher in PBMCs \nand > 90% lower concentrations of tenofovir in plasma as compared to a 245 mg oral dose of tenofovir \ndisoproxil (as fumarate) in E/C/F/TDF. \n \nIn vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4.  Upon co-administration \nwith the moderate CYP3A inducer probe efavirenz, tenofovir alafenamide exposure was not \nsignificantly affected.  Following administration of tenofovir alafenamide, plasma [14C]-radioactivity \nshowed a time-dependent profile with tenofovir alafenamide as the most abundant species in the initial \nfew hours and uric acid in the remaining period. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of [14C]-elvitegravir/ritonavir, 94.8% of the dose was recovered in \nfaeces, consistent with the hepatobiliary excretion of elvitegravir; 6.7% of the administered dose was \nrecovered in urine.  The median terminal plasma half-life of elvitegravir following administration of \nE/C/F/TDF is approximately 12.9 hours. \n \nFollowing oral administration of [14C]-cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in faeces \nand urine, respectively.  The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of \nE/C/F/TDF is approximately 3.5 hours and the associated cobicistat exposures provide elvitegravir \nCtrough approximately 10-fold above the protein-binding adjusted IC95 for wild-type HIV-1 virus. \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nRenal excretion of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with < 1% of the dose eliminated \nin urine.  Tenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir \nalafenamide and tenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively.  \nTenofovir is eliminated from the body by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active tubular \nsecretion. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, gender, and ethnicity \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender or ethnicity have been identified for \ncobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nExposures of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and tenofovir alafenamide achieved in \n24 adolescent patients aged 12 to < 18 years who received Genvoya in Study GS-US-292-0106 were \nsimilar to exposures achieved in treatment-na\u00efve adults following administration of Genvoya \n(Table 5). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nTable 5: Pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and tenofovir \nalafenamide in antiretroviral-na\u00efve adolescents and adults \n \n\n \n\nAdolescents aged 12 to < 18 years, \u2265 35 kg Adults \nGenvoya Genvoya \n\nEVGa COBIa FTCa TAFb TFVb EVGe COBIe FTCe TAFf TFVf \nAUCtau \n(ng\u2022h/mL\n) \n\n23,840.\n1 (25.5) \n\n8,240.8 \n(36.1)b \n\n14,424.\n4 (23.9) \n\n242.8\nc \n\n(57.8) \n\n275.8 \n(18.4\n\n) \n\n22,797.\n0 (34.7) \n\n9,459.\n1 \n\n(33.9) \n\n11,714.\n1 (16.6) \n\n206.4 \n(71.8\n\n) \n\n292.6 \n(27.4\n\n) \nCmax \n(ng/mL) 2,229.6 (19.2) \n\n1,202.4 \n(35.0) \n\n2,265.0 \n(22.5) \n\n121.7 \n(46.2) \n\n14.6 \n(20.0\n\n) \n\n2,113.1 \n(33.7) \n\n1,450.\n3 \n\n(28.4) \n\n2,056.3 \n(20.2) \n\n162.2 \n(51.1\n\n) \n\n15.2 \n(26.1\n\n) \nCtau \n(ng/mL) 300.8 (81.0) \n\n25.0 \n(180.0)\n\nd \n\n102.4 \n(38.9)b N/A \n\n10.0 \n(19.6\n\n) \n\n287.3 \n(61.7) \n\n20.6 \n(85.2) \n\n95.2 \n(46.7) N/A \n\n10.6 \n(28.5\n\n) \nEVG = elvitegravir; COBI = cobicistat; FTC = emtricitabine; TAF = tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; TFV = tenofovir \nN/A = not applicable \nData are presented as mean (%CV). \na n = 24 adolescents. \nb n = 23 adolescents. \nc AUClast. \nd n = 15 adolescents. \ne n = 19 adults. \nf n = 539 (TAF) or 841 (TFV) adults. \n \nMean exposures of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and tenofovir alafenamide \nachieved in children aged 8 to < 12 years (> 25 kg; n = 23) who received Genvoya in study \nGS-US-292-0106 were higher (20 to 80%) than the mean exposures achieved in adults (Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and tenofovir \nalafenamide in virologically suppressed children and adults \n \n\n \n\nChildren aged 8 to < 12 years, > 25 kg Adults \nGenvoya Genvoya \n\nEVGa COBIa FTCa TAFa TFVa EVGe COBIe FTCe TAFf TFVf \nAUCtau \n(ng\u2022h/mL\n) \n\n33,813.\n9 \n\n(57.8)b \n\n15,890.\n7 \n\n(51.7)c \n\n20,629.\n2 \n\n(18.9)b \n\n332.9\nd \n\n(44.8) \n\n440.2 \n(20.9\n\n) \n\n22,797.\n0 (34.7) \n\n9,459.\n1 \n\n(33.9) \n\n11,714.\n1 (16.6) \n\n206.4 \n(71.8\n\n) \n\n292.6 \n(27.4\n\n) \nCmax \n(ng/mL) 3,055.2 (38.7) \n\n2,079.4 \n(46.7) \n\n3,397.4 \n(27.0) \n\n313.3 \n(61.2) \n\n26.1 \n(20.8\n\n) \n\n2,113.1 \n(33.7) \n\n1,450.\n3 \n\n(28.4) \n\n2,056.3 \n(20.2) \n\n162.2 \n(51.1\n\n) \n\n15.2 \n(26.1\n\n) \nCtau \n(ng/mL) 370.0 (118.5) \n\n96.0 \n(168.7) \n\n114.9 \n(24.1) N/A \n\n15.1 \n(24.9\n\n) \n\n287.3 \n(61.7) \n\n20.6 \n(85.2) \n\n95.2 \n(46.7) N/A \n\n10.6 \n(28.5\n\n) \nEVG = elvitegravir; COBI = cobicistat; FTC = emtricitabine; TAF = tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; TFV = tenofovir \nN/A = not applicable \nData are presented as mean (%CV). \na n = 23 children. \nb n = 22 children. \nc n = 20 children. \nd AUClast. \ne n = 19 adults. \nf n = 539 (TAF) or 841 (TFV) adults. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinically relevant differences in elvitegravir, cobicistat, tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir \npharmacokinetics were observed between healthy subjects and patients with severe renal impairment \n(estimated CrCl \u2265 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min) in Phase 1 studies of cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir \nor of tenofovir alafenamide, respectively.  In a separate Phase 1 study of emtricitabine alone, mean \nsystemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated \nCrCl < 30 mL/min) (33.7 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL) than in subjects with normal renal function (11.8 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL).  The \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nsafety of Genvoya has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated \nCrCl \u2265 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min). \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 12 patients with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis who received Genvoya in Study GS-US-292-1825 were \nsignificantly higher than in patients with normal renal function.  No clinically relevant differences in \nelvitegravir, cobicistat, or tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with \nend stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function.  \nThere were no new safety issues identified in patients with end stage renal disease on chronic \nhaemodialysis receiving Genvoya (see section 4.8). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data on elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide \nin patients with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) not on chronic haemodialysis.  \nThe safety of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide has not been established \nin these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBoth elvitegravir and cobicistat are primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A study of the \npharmacokinetics of cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir was performed in non-HIV-1 infected patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B).  No clinically relevant differences in \nelvitegravir or cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment and subjects with normal hepatic function.  The effect of severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir or cobicistat has not been studied. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment; \nhowever, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver \nimpairment should be limited. \n \nClinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide or its metabolite \ntenofovir were not observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  In patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment, total plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir are \nlower than those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function.  When corrected for protein binding, \nunbound (free) plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide in severe hepatic impairment and \nnormal hepatic function are similar. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide have not been fully evaluated in \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus.  Limited data from population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis (n = 24) indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus infection had no clinically relevant effect on \nthe exposure of boosted elvitegravir. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \nThe results reported from a prospective study (IMPAACT P1026s) showed that treatment with \ncobicistat and elvitegravir-containing regimens during pregnancy results in lower elvitegravir and \ncobicistat exposures (Table 7).  \n \nTable 7: Changes in pharmacokinetic parameters from the IMPAACT P1026s study for \nelvitegravir and cobicistat in women receiving cobicistat and elvitegravir-containing regimens \nduring the second and third trimesters of pregnancy compared to paired postpartum data \n \n\nComparison to paired \npostpartum data, n \n\nMean % change of elvitegravir \npharmacokinetic parametersa \n\nMean % change of cobicistat \npharmacokinetic parametersa \n\nAUC24 Cmax C24 AUC24 Cmax C24 \n2T/PP, n = 14 \u2193 24%b \u2193 8% \u2193 81%b \u2193 44%b \u2193 28%b \u2193 60%b \n3T/PP, n = 24 \u2193 44%b \u2193 28%b \u2193 89%b \u2193 59%b \u2193 38%b \u2193 76%b \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n2T = second trimester; 3T = third trimester; PP =postpartum \na paired comparisons \nb P<0.10 compared with postpartum \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nElvitegravir was negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test) and negative in an \nin vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg.  In an in vitro chromosomal aberration test, \nelvitegravir was negative with metabolic activation; however, an equivocal response was observed \nwithout activation. \n \nCobicistat was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays.  Ex vivo rabbit \nstudies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT prolongation, and \nmay slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at concentrations at least \n11-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily dose.  In a human clinical \nstudy of 35 healthy subjects, echocardiograms performed at baseline and after receiving 150 mg \ncobicistat once daily for at least 15 days indicated no clinically significant change in left ventricular \nfunction. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with cobicistat showed no effects on mating, fertility, \npregnancy or foetal parameters.  However increased post-implantation loss and decreased foetal \nweights were observed in rats associated with significant decreases in maternal body weights at \n125 mg/kg/day. \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \nElvitegravir, cobicistat, and emtricitabine have all demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in mice \nand rats. \n \nNon-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary \ntarget organs of toxicity.  Bone toxicity was observed as reduced bone mineral density in rats and dogs \nat tenofovir exposures at least 4 times greater than those expected after administration of Genvoya.  A \nminimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and \ntenofovir exposures of approximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after \nadministration of Genvoya. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n \nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir \nalafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-postnatal study \nwere conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil.  No special hazard for humans was revealed in \nconventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development.  \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfoetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a \nperi-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Genvoya has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet \nis addressed to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d). \n \n \n1. What Genvoya is and what it is used for \n \nGenvoya contains four active substances: \n \n\u2022 elvitegravir, an antiretroviral medicine known as an integrase inhibitor \n\u2022 cobicistat, a booster (pharmacokinetic enhancer) of the effects of elvitegravir \n\u2022 emtricitabine, an antiretroviral medicine known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor \n\n(NRTI) \n\u2022 tenofovir alafenamide, an antiretroviral medicine known as a nucleotide reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NtRTI) \n \nGenvoya is a single tablet for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection \nin adults, adolescents and children 6 years of age and older, who weigh at least 25 kg. \n \nGenvoya reduces the amount of HIV in your body.  This will improve your immune system and \nreduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Genvoya \n \nDo not take Genvoya: \n\u2022 If you are allergic to elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n\u2022 If you are taking one of these medicines: \n- alfuzosin (used to treat an enlarged prostate gland) \n- dabigatran (used to prevent and treat blood clots) \n- amiodarone, quinidine (used to correct irregular heartbeats) \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (used to prevent seizures) \n- rifampicin (used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections) \n- dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine (used to treat migraine headache) \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems) \n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and \n\nanxiety) or products that contain it \n- lovastatin, simvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n- pimozide, lurasidone (used to treat abnormal thoughts or feelings) \n- sildenafil (when used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension \u2013 a lung disease that makes \n\nbreathing difficult) \n- orally administered midazolam, triazolam (used to help you sleep and/or relieve \n\nanxiety) \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, do not take Genvoya and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Genvoya. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Genvoya you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Genvoya: \n \n\u2022 If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B infection, liver problems may become worse after you stop taking \nGenvoya.  It is important not to stop taking Genvoya without talking to your doctor: see \nsection 3, Do not stop taking Genvoya. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are intolerant to lactose (see Genvoya contains lactose later in this section). \n \nWhile you are taking Genvoya \n \nOnce you start taking Genvoya, look out for: \n \n\u2022 Signs of inflammation or infection \n\u2022 Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see \n\nsection 4, Possible side effects. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children aged 5 years or under, or weighing less than 25 kg regardless \nof age.  The use of Genvoya in children aged 5 years or under has not yet been studied. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nOther medicines and Genvoya \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Genvoya may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Genvoya or other \nmedicines in your blood may be affected.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or \nmay make any side effects worse.

Pregnant women should not take Genvoya.  The amount of this \nmedicine in your blood may decrease during pregnancy which may stop it from working \nproperly. \n\n\u2022 Use effective contraception while taking Genvoya. \n\u2022 Do not breast-feed during treatment with Genvoya.  This is because some of the active \n\nsubstances in this medicine pass into human breast milk.  It is recommended that you do not \nbreast-feed to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nGenvoya can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy when taking Genvoya, do not drive or ride a bicycle \nand do not use any tools or machines. \n \nGenvoya contains lactose \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor before taking Genvoya. \n \n \n3. How to take Genvoya \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \nThe recommended dose is: \n \nAdults: one tablet each day with food \nAdolescents and children 6 years of age and older, who weigh at least 25 kg: one tablet each day \nwith food \n \nDo not chew or crush the tablet. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, you can split it in half.  Take both halves of the \ntablet one after the other to get the full dose.  Do not store the split tablet. \n \nAlways take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is \nfully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the \ndose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nDo not take antacids or multivitamins at the same time as Genvoya.  If you are taking an antacid \nsuch as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or a multivitamin supplement, take it at least 4 hours \nbefore or at least 4 hours after Genvoya. \n \nIf you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Genvoya following completion of dialysis. \n \nIf you take more Genvoya than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Genvoya you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Genvoya \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Genvoya. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n\u2022 If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Genvoya, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n\u2022 If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Genvoya, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Genvoya, take another tablet with food. \n \nDo not stop taking Genvoya \n \nDo not stop taking Genvoya without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Genvoya can seriously \naffect your response to future treatment.  If Genvoya is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor \nbefore you restart taking Genvoya tablets. \n \nWhen your supply of Genvoya starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nIf you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Genvoya \ntreatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after \nstopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not \nrecommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by Genvoya or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease \nitself. \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n \n\u2022 Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak \nimmune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement \nin the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been \npresent with no obvious symptoms. \n\n \n\u2022 Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur \n\nafter you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms \nsuch as: \n- muscle weakness \n- weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n- palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. \n\n \n\uf0e0 If you notice the side effects described above, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects \n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 abnormal dreams \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 stomach pain \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 tiredness (fatigue) \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n\u2022 suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt (in patients who have had depression or mental health \n\nproblems before), depression \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 hives (urticaria) \n \n\uf0e0 If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n\u2022 Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Genvoya \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement \n\n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Genvoya \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle after {EXP}.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture.  Keep the bottle tightly closed. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Since \nthe previous review, 6 new cases were identified (5 valid and 1 invalid). The cases evaluated in this \nreview mostly occurred in patients with history of psychiatric events or other external factors reported \nthat may have contributed to the event. Disproportionality analysis did not highlight events that met \nthe criteria for signal of disproportionate reporting. However, based on the information retrieved in \nliterature and in the product information of integrase inhibitors containing medicinal products, it could \nbe concluded that the following psychiatric disorders: depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal \nbehaviour (particularly in patients with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness) are class-effect of \nintegrase inhibitors and these are listed in the SmPC of other medicinal products containing integrase \ninhibitors in monotherapy and in fixed-dose combination (FDC). \n\nSimilar patterns of psychiatric disorders were observed in comparative studies of \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) versus \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF), which lists these \nevents in its product information (studies GS-US-292-0104 or GS-US-292-0111). Based on this, \nsection 4.8 of the SmPC of medicinal products containing \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide FDC has been updated to add suicidal \nideation and suicide attempt (in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness) \nas new adverse drug reactions. In clinical trials, the incidence of SAEs related to suicide for Genvoya \nwas 0.6% (26/4137 subjects), therefore, the frequency proposed is \u201cuncommon\u201d. \n\n \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir \nalafenamide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) \ncontaining cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

{"Title": "3. how to take genvoya", "Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the recommended dose is: adults: one tablet each day with food adolescents and children 6 years of age and older, who weigh at least 25 kg: one tablet each day with food do not chew or crush the tablet. if you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, you can split it in half. take both halves of the tablet one after the other to get the full dose. do not store the split tablet. always take the dose recommended by your doctor. this is to make sure that your medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. do not change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. do not take antacids or multivitamins at the same time as genvoya. if you are taking an antacid such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or a multivitamin supplement, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after genvoya. if you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of genvoya following completion of dialysis. if you take more genvoya than you should if you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of genvoya you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, possible side effects). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take genvoya it is important not to miss a dose of genvoya. if you do miss a dose: if you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take genvoya, you must take the tablet as soon as possible. always take the tablet with food. then take the next dose as usual. if you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take genvoya, then do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. if you vomit less than 1 hour after taking genvoya, take another tablet with food. do not stop taking genvoya do not stop taking genvoya without talking to your doctor. stopping genvoya can seriously affect your response to future treatment. if genvoya is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you restart taking genvoya tablets. when your supply of genvoya starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. this is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. the disease may then become harder to treat. if you have both hiv infection and hepatitis b, it is especially important not to stop your genvoya treatment without talking to your doctor first. you may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis b infection. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "genvoya", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT",

to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. when treating hiv infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are caused by genvoya or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the hiv disease itself. possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately any signs of inflammation or infection. in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur after you start taking medicines for hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: - muscle weakness - weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body - palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. if you notice the side effects described above, tell your doctor immediately. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) feeling sick (nausea) common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) abnormal dreams headache dizziness diarrhoea vomiting stomach pain wind (flatulence) rash tiredness (fatigue) 50 uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) low red blood cell count (anaemia) suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt (in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before), depression problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) itching (pruritus) hives (urticaria) if any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. other effects that may be seen during hiv treatment the frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). bone problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as genvoya may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are: - joint stiffness - joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) - difficulty with movement if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "genvoya",
