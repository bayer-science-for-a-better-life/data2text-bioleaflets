CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZeposia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis \n(RRMS) with active disease as defined by clinical or imaging features. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of \nmultiple sclerosis (MS). \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose is 0.92 mg ozanimod once daily.  \nThe capsules can be taken with or without food. \n\nThe initial dose escalation regimen of ozanimod from Day 1 to Day 7 is required and shown below in \nTable 1. Following the 7-day dose escalation, the maintenance dose is 0.92 mg once daily, starting on \nDay 8. \n\nTable 1: Dose escalation regimen \nDays 1 – 4 0.23 mg once daily\nDays 5 – 7 0.46 mg once daily\nDays 8 and thereafter 0.92 mg once daily\n\nRe-initiation of therapy following treatment interruption \nThe same dose escalation regimen described in Table 1 is recommended when treatment is interrupted \nfor: \n 1 day or more during the first 14 days of treatment. \n more than 7 consecutive days between Day 15 and Day 28 of treatment. \n more than 14 consecutive days after Day 28 of treatment. \nIf the treatment interruption is of shorter duration than the above, the treatment should be continued \nwith the next dose as planned. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nAdults over 55 years old and elderly population \nThere are limited data available on RRMS patients > 55 years of age. Patients enrolled in the ongoing \nclinical trials continue to be dosed with 0.92 mg ozanimod daily after they become 55 and older (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is needed in patients over 55 years of age. Caution should \nbe used in patients > 55 years of age, given the potential for an increased risk of adverse reactions in \nthis population, especially with long-term treatment. \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass A and B).  \nOzanimod was not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) must not be treated with ozanimod (see sections 4.3 \nand 5.2). \n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Zeposia in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Immunodeficient state (see section 4.4).\n Patients who in the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, \n\nstroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalisation \nor New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV heart failure.\n\n Patients with history or presence of second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block Type II or third-\ndegree AV block or sick sinus syndrome unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker. \n\n Severe active infections, active chronic infections such as hepatitis and tuberculosis (see section \n4.4).\n\n Active malignancies.\n Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n During pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBradyarrhythmia \n\nInitiation of treatment with ozanimod \nPrior to treatment initiation with ozanimod, an ECG in all patients should be obtained to determine \nwhether any pre-existing cardiac abnormalities are present. In patients with certain pre-existing \nconditions, first-dose monitoring is recommended (see below). \n\nInitiation of ozanimod may result in transient reductions in heart rate (HR) (see sections 4.8 and 5.1), \nand, therefore the initial dose escalation regimen to reach the maintenance dose (0.92 mg) on day 8 \nshould be followed (see section 4.2).  \nAfter the initial dose of ozanimod 0.23 mg, the HR decrease started at Hour 4, with the greatest mean \nreduction at Hour 5, returning to near baseline at Hour 6. With continued dose escalation, there were \nno clinically relevant HR decreases. Heart rates below 40 beats per minute were not observed. If \nnecessary, the decrease in HR induced by ozanimod can be reversed by parenteral doses of atropine or \nisoprenaline.  \nCaution should be applied when ozanimod is initiated in patients receiving treatment with a beta-\nblocker or a calcium-channel blocker (e.g. diltiazem and verapamil) because of the potential for \nadditive effects on lowering HR. Beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers treatment can be \ninitiated in patients receiving stable doses of ozanimod. \nThe co-administration of ozanimod in patients on a beta blocker in combination with a calcium \nchannel blocker has not been studied (see section 4.5). \n\nFirst dose monitoring in patients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions \nDue to the risk of transient decreases in HR with the initiation of ozanimod, first-dose, 6-hour \nmonitoring for signs and symptoms of symptomatic bradycardia is recommended in patients with \nresting HR <55 bpm, second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or \nheart failure (see section 4.3).  \nPatients should be monitored with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement during this 6-hour \nperiod. An ECG prior to and at the end of this 6-hour period is recommended. \n\n\n\n5\n\nAdditional monitoring after 6 hours is recommended in patients with:  \n heart rate less than 45 bpm \n heart rate is the lowest value post-dose, suggesting that the maximum decrease in HR may not \n\nhave occurred yet \n evidence of a new onset second-degree or higher AV block at the 6- hour post-dose ECG\n QTc interval ≥500 msec\nIn these cases, appropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the \nsymptoms/findings have resolved. If medical treatment is required, monitoring should be continued \novernight, and a 6-hour monitoring period should be repeated after the second dose of ozanimod. \n\nCardiologist advice should be obtained before initiation of ozanimod in the following patients to \ndecide if ozanimod can safely be initiated and to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy \n history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated \n\nsleep apnoea, history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia;\n pre-existing significant QT interval prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec) or other risks for \n\nQT prolongation, and patients on medicinal products other than beta-blockers and calcium-\nchannel blockers that may potentiate bradycardia; \n\n Patients on class Ia (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) \nantiarrhythmic medicinal products, which have been associated with cases of torsades de \npointes in patients with bradycardia have not been studied with ozanimod.\n\nLiver function \n\nElevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ozanimod (see section 4.8).\nRecent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available before \ninitiation of treatment with ozanimod. In the absence of clinical symptoms, liver transaminases and \nbilirubin levels should be monitored at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 on therapy and periodically thereafter. \nIf liver transaminases rise above 5 times the ULN, more frequent monitoring should be instituted. If \nliver transaminases above 5 times the ULN are confirmed, treatment with ozanimod should be \ninterrupted and only re-commenced once liver transaminase values have normalised. \nPatients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine, should have hepatic \nenzymes checked and ozanimod should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. \nResumption of therapy will be dependent on whether another cause of liver injury is determined and \non the benefits to patient of resuming therapy versus the risks of recurrence of liver dysfunction. \nPatients with pre-existing liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated hepatic \nenzymes when taking ozanimod (see section 4.2).  \nOzanimod has not been studied in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic injury (Child-Pugh class \nC) and must not be used in these patients (see section 4.3). \n\nImmunosuppressive effects \n\nOzanimod has an immunosuppressive effect that predisposes patients to a risk of infection, including \nopportunistic infections, and may increase the risk of developing malignancies, including those of the \nskin. Physicians should carefully monitor patients, especially those with concurrent conditions or \nknown factors, such as previous immunosuppressive therapy. If this risk is suspected, discontinuation \nof treatment should be considered by the physician on a case-by-case basis (see section 4.3). \n\nInfections \n\nOzanimod causes a mean reduction in peripheral blood lymphocyte count to 45% of baseline values \nbecause of reversible retention of lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissues. Ozanimod may, therefore, \nincrease the susceptibility to infections (see section 4.8).\nA recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy) complete blood cell count \n(CBC) should be obtained, including lymphocyte count, before initiation of ozanimod.  \n\n\n\n6\n\nAssessments of CBC are also recommended periodically during treatment. Absolute lymphocyte \ncounts <0.2 x 109/l, if confirmed, should lead to interruption of ozanimod therapy until the level \nreaches > 0.5 x 109/l when re-initiation of ozanimod can be considered. \nThe initiation of ozanimod administration in patients with any active infection should be delayed until \nthe infection is resolved.  \nPatients should be instructed to report promptly symptoms of infection to their physician. Effective \ndiagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in patients with symptoms of infection while \non therapy. If a patient develops a serious infection, treatment interruption with ozanimod should be \nconsidered. \nBecause the elimination of ozanimod after discontinuation may take up to 3 months, monitoring for \ninfections should be continued throughout this period. \n\nPrior and concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating \ntherapies \n\nIn MS clinical studies, patients who received ozanimod were not to receive concomitant \nantineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for \ntreatment of MS. Concomitant use of ozanimod with any of these therapies would be expected to \nincrease the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ozanimod from immunosuppressive \nmedicinal products, the half-life and mode of action must be considered to avoid an additive immune \neffect whilst at the same time minimizing the risk of disease reactivation.  \nOzanimod can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon (IFN). \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\nPML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV) that \ntypically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised and may lead to death or severe disability. \nJCV infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with MS therapies and has been \nassociated with some risk factors (e.g., polytherapy with immunosuppressants, severely \nimmunocompromised patients). Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over \ndays to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, \ndisturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and \npersonality changes.  \nPhysicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings that may be suggestive of PML. \nMRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, treatment with \nozanimod should be suspended until PML has been excluded. If confirmed, treatment with ozanimod \nshould be discontinued.\n\nVaccinations \n\nNo clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations in patients taking ozanimod. \nThe use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with \nozanimod.  \nIf live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, these should be administered at least 1 month \nprior to initiation of ozanimod. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) vaccination of patients without \ndocumented immunity to VZV is recommended prior to initiating treatment with ozanimod. \n\nCutaneous neoplasms \n\nHalf of the neoplasms reported with ozanimod in the controlled Phase 3 studies consisted of \nnon-melanoma skin malignancies, with basal cell carcinoma presenting as the most common skin \nneoplasm and reported with similar incidence rates in the combined ozanimod (0.2%, 3 patients) and \nIFN ß-1a (0.1 %, 1 patient) groups.  \n\n\n\n7\n\nSince there is a potential risk of malignant skin growths, patients treated with ozanimod should be \ncautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. These patients should not receive \nconcomitant phototherapy with UV-B-radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy. \n\nMacular oedema \n\nMacular oedema with or without visual symptoms was observed with ozanimod (see section 4.8) in \npatients with pre-existing risk factors or comorbid conditions.  \nPatients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus or underlying/co existing retinal disease are at \nincreased risk of macular oedema (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients with diabetes \nmellitus, uveitis or a history of retinal disease undergo an ophthalmological evaluation prior to \ntreatment initiation with ozanimod and have follow up evaluations while receiving therapy.  \nPatients who present with visual symptoms of macular oedema should be evaluated and, if confirmed, \ntreatment with ozanimod should be discontinued. A decision on whether ozanimod should be re-\ninitiated after resolution needs to take into account the potential benefits and risks for the individual \npatient. \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \n\nPRES is a syndrome characterised by sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and visual \nloss. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischaemic stroke or cerebral \nhaemorrhage. In controlled clinical trials with ozanimod, one case of PRES was reported in a patient \nwith Guillain-Barré syndrome. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ozanimod should be \ndiscontinued. \n\nBlood pressure effects \n\nIn MS clinical studies, hypertension was more frequently reported in patients treated with ozanimod \nthan in patients treated with IFN β-1a IM and in patients receiving concomitant ozanimod and SSRIs \nor SNRIs (see section 4.8). Blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with \nozanimod. \n\nRespiratory effects \n\nOzanimod should be used with caution in patients with severe respiratory disease, pulmonary fibrosis \nand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nThe coadministration with inhibitors of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), inhibitors of \nmonoamine oxidase (MAO), or CYP2C8 inducer (rifampin) with ozanimod is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nDue to risk to the foetus, ozanimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing \npotential not using effective contraception. Before initiation of treatment, women of childbearing \npotential must be informed of this risk to the foetus, must have a negative pregnancy test and must use \neffective contraception during treatment, and for 3 months after treatment discontinuation (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.6 and the information contained in the Healthcare Professional checklist). \n\nReturn of disease activity (rebound) after ozanimod discontinuation \n\nSevere exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after \ndiscontinuation of another S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease \n\n\n\n8\n\nafter stopping ozanimod treatment should be considered. Patients should be observed for relevant \nsigns of possible severe exacerbation or return of high disease activity upon ozanimod discontinuation \nand appropriate treatment should be instituted as required. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of inhibitors of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) on ozanimod \n\nAn inhibitor of the BCRP (ciclosporin) doubled the exposure (AUC) of the minor active metabolites \nwhich may subsequently lead to a similar increase in the major active metabolites and increase the \nrisk of adverse reactions. The coadministration of BCRP inhibitors (e.g. ciclosporin and eltrombopag) \nwith ozanimod is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\nEffect of inhibitors of CYP2C8 on ozanimod \n\nThe coadministration of gemfibrozil (a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8) 600 mg twice daily at steady \nstate and a single dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg increased exposure (AUC) of the major active \nmetabolites by approximately 47% to 69%. Caution should be exercised for concomitant use of \nozanimod with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil, clopidogrel). \n\nEffect of inducers of CYP2C8 on ozanimod \n\nThe coadministration of rifampin (a strong inducer of CYP3A and P-gp, and a moderate inducer of \nCYP2C8) 600 mg once daily at steady state and a single dose of ozanimod 0.92 mg reduced exposure \n(AUC) of major active metabolites by approximately 60% via CYP2C8 induction which may result in \nreduced clinical response. The coadministration of CYP2C8 inducers (i.e., rifampin) with ozanimod is \nnot recommended (see section 4.4). \n\nEffect of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) on ozanimod \n\nThe potential for clinical interaction with MAO inhibitors has not been studied. However, the \ncoadministration with MAO-B inhibitors may decrease exposure of the major active metabolites and \nmay result in reduced clinical response. The coadministration of MAO inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, \nphenelzine) with ozanimod is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\nEffects of ozanimod on medicinal products that slow heart rate or atrioventricular conduction (e.g., \nbeta blockers or calcium channel blockers) \n\nIn healthy subjects, a single dose of ozanimod 0.23 mg with steady state propranolol long acting 80 \nmg once daily or diltiazem 240 mg once daily did not result in any additional clinically meaningful \nchanges in HR and PR interval compared to either propranolol or diltiazem alone. Caution should be \napplied when ozanimod is initiated in patients receiving treatment with a beta-blocker or a calcium-\nchannel blocker (see section 4.4). Patients on other bradycardic medicinal products and on \nantiarrhythmic medicinal products (which have been associated with cases of torsades de pointes in \npatients with bradycardia) have not been studied with ozanimod. \n\nVaccination \n\nDuring and for up to 3 months after treatment with ozanimod, vaccination may be less effective. The \nuse of live attenuated vaccines may carry a risk of infections and should, therefore, be avoided during \nand for up to 3 months after treatment with ozanimod (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n9\n\nAnti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapies  \n\nAnti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapies should not \nbe coadministered due to the risk of additive immune system effects (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females \n\nZeposia is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (see \nsection 4.3). Therefore, before initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential, a negative \npregnancy test result must be available and counselling should be provided regarding the risk to the \nfoetus. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during ozanimod treatment \nand for 3 months after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n\nSpecific measures are also included in the Healthcare Professional checklist. These measures must \nbe implemented before ozanimod is prescribed to female patients and during treatment. \n\nWhen stopping ozanimod therapy for planning a pregnancy the possible return of disease activity \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ozanimod in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including foetal loss and anomalies, notably \nmalformations of blood vessels, generalised oedema (anasarca), and malpositioned testes and \nvertebrae (see section 5.3). The receptor affected by ozanimod (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor) is \nknown to be involved in vascular formation during embryogenesis (see section 5.3). \nConsequently, Zeposia is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  Zeposia should be \nstopped 3 months before planning a pregnancy (see section 4.4). If a woman becomes pregnant during \ntreatment, Zeposia must be discontinued.  Medical advice should be given regarding the risk of \nharmful effects to the foetus associated with treatment and ultrasonography examinations should be \nperformed. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nOzanimod/metabolites are excreted in milk of treated animals during lactation (see section 5.3). Due \nto the potential for serious adverse reactions to ozanimod/metabolites in nursing infants, women \nreceiving ozanimod should not breastfeed.\n\nFertility \n\nNo fertility data are available in humans. In animal studies, no adverse effects on fertility were \nobserved (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZeposia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n\n\n10\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are nasopharyngitis (11%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (5%), and gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (5%). \nThe most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were related to liver enzyme \nelevations (1.1%). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions observed in patients treated with ozanimod are listed below by system organ \nclass (SOC) and frequency for all adverse reactions. Within each SOC and frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). \n\nTable 2: Summary of adverse reactions reported in MS \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction\n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nVery common Nasopharyngitis \n\nCommon \nPharyngitis, Respiratory tract infection viral, \nUrinary tract infection*\n\nUncommon Herpes zoster \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nVery common Lymphopenia \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity (including rash and urticaria*)\n\nEye disorders Uncommon Macular oedema** \n\nCardiac disorders Common Bradycardia*  \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension*†, Orthostatic hypotension \n\nInvestigations Common \n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased,  \nGamma-glutamyl transferase increased, \nBlood bilirubin increased,  \nPulmonary function test abnormal***\n\n*At least one of these adverse reactions was reported as serious \n† Includes hypertension, essential hypertension, and blood pressure increased (see section 4.4). \n** for patients with pre-existing factors (see section 4.4) \n***including pulmonary function test decreased, spirometry abnormal, forced vital capacity decreased, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity \ndecreased, forced expiratory volume decreased \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nElevated hepatic enzymes \nIn MS clinical studies, elevations of ALT to 5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater \noccurred in 1.6% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and 1.3% of patients on IFN β-1a IM. \nElevations of 3-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 5.5% of patients on ozanimod and 3.1% of \npatients on IFN β-1a IM. The median time to elevation 3-fold the ULN was 6 months. The majority \n(79%) continued treatment with ozanimod with values returning to < 3-fold the ULN within \napproximately 2-4 weeks. In MS clinical studies, ozanimod was discontinued for a confirmed \nelevation greater than 5-fold the ULN. Overall, the discontinuation rate due to elevations in hepatic \nenzymes was 1.1% of patients on ozanimod 0.92 mg and 0.8% of patients on IFN beta-1a IM.  \n\n\n\n11\n\nBradyarrhythmia \nIn MS clinical studies, after the initial dose of ozanimod 0.23 mg, the greatest mean reduction from \nbaseline in sitting/ supine HR of 1.2 bpm occurred at Hour 5 on day 1, returning to near baseline at \nHour 6. With continued dose escalation, there were no clinically relevant HR decreases. \nIn MS clinical studies, bradycardia was reported in 0.5% of patients treated with ozanimod versus 0% \nof patients treated with IFN β-1a IM on the day of treatment initiation (Day 1). After Day 1, the \nincidence of bradycardia was 0.8% on ozanimod versus 0.7% on IFN β-1a IM. (see section 5.1). \nPatients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic. Heart rates below 40 beats per \nminute were not observed. \nIn MS clinical studies, first-degree atrioventricular block was reported in 0.6% (5/882) of patients \ntreated with ozanimod versus 0.2% (2/885) treated with IFN β-1a IM. Of the cases reported with \nozanimod, 0.2% were reported on Day 1 and 0.3% were reported after Day 1. \n\nIncreased blood pressure \nIn MS clinical studies, patients treated with ozanimod had an average increase of approximately \n1-2 mm Hg in systolic pressure over IFN β-1a IM, and approximately 1 mm Hg in diastolic pressure \nover IFN β-1a IM. The increase in systolic pressure was first detected after approximately 3 months \nof treatment initiation and remained stable throughout treatment. \nHypertension-related events (hypertension, essential hypertension, and blood pressure increased) were \nreported as an adverse reaction in 4.5% of patients treated with ozanimod 0.92 mg and in 2.3% of \npatients treated with IFN β-1a IM. \n\nBlood lymphocyte count reduction \nIn MS clinical studies, 3.3% of patients experienced lymphocyte counts less than 0.2 x 109/L with \nvalues generally resolving to greater than 0.2 x 109/L while remaining on treatment with ozanimod.  \n\nInfections \nIn MS clinical studies, the overall rate of infections (35%) with ozanimod 0.92 mg was similar to IFN \nβ-1a IM. Ozanimod increased the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infection. \nThe overall rate of serious infections was similar between ozanimod (1%) and IFN β-1a IM (0.8%) in \nMS clinical studies. \n\nHerpes zoster \nIn MS clinical studies, herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.6% of patients treated \nwith Zeposia 0.92 mg and in 0.2% of patients on IFN β-1a IM. \n\nRespiratory system \nMinor dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital \ncapacity (FVC) were observed with ozanimod treatment. At months 3 and 12 of treatment in MS \nclinical studies, median changes from baseline in FEV1 (FVC) in the ozanimod 1 mg group were - \n0.07 L and - 0.1 L (- 0.05 L and – 0.065 L), respectively, with smaller changes from baseline in the \nIFN ß-1a group (FEV1: - 0.01 L and - 0.04 L, FVC: 0.00 L and -0.02 L). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn patients with overdosage of ozanimod, monitor for signs and symptoms of bradycardia, which may \ninclude overnight monitoring. Regular measurements of HR and blood pressure are required, and \n\n\n\n12\n\nECGs should be performed (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The decrease in HR induced by ozanimod can \nbe reversed by parenteral atropine or isoprenaline. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA38 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nOzanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, which binds selectively to \nsphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5. Ozanimod causes lymphocyte retention in \nlymphoid tissues. The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects in MS is unknown, \nbut may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system (CNS). \nOzanimod is 10-fold more selective for S1P1 relative to S1P5 and has little activity on other S1P \nreceptors (S1P2, S1P3, and S1P4). Ozanimod is extensively metabolised in humans to form a number \nof circulating active metabolites (see section 5.2). In vitro, ozanimod and its active metabolites \ndemonstrated similar activity and selectivity for S1P1 and S1P5. In humans, approximately 94% of \ncirculating total active drug exposure are represented by ozanimod (6%) and the two major \nmetabolites CC112273 (73%), and CC1084037 (15%) (see section 5.2).  \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nReduction of peripheral blood lymphocytes \nOzanimod induces a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count within 6 \nhours of the first dose, caused by the reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues.  \nIn active-controlled MS clinical studies, mean lymphocyte counts decreased to approximately 45% of \nbaseline at 3 months (approximate mean blood lymphocyte count 0.8 x 109/L) and remained stable \nduring treatment with ozanimod. After discontinuing ozanimod 0.92 mg, the median time to recovery \nof peripheral blood lymphocytes to the normal range was 30 days, with 90% of patients recovering to \nnormal within 3 months (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nHeart rate and rhythm \nOzanimod may cause a transient reduction in HR on initiation of dosing (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \nThis negative chronotropic effect is mechanistically related to the activation of G-protein-coupled \ninwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels via S1P1 receptor stimulation by ozanimod and its \nactive metabolites leading to cellular hyperpolarisation and reduced excitability with a maximal effect \non HR seen within 5 hours post dose. Due to its functional antagonism at S1P1 receptors, a dose \nescalation schedule with ozanimod 0.23 mg followed by 0.46 mg, and 0.92 mg successively \ndesensitizes GIRK channels until the maintenance dose is reached. After the dose escalation period, \nwith continued administration of ozanimod, HR returns to baseline. \n\nPotential to prolong the QT interval \nIn a randomised, positive - and placebo-controlled thorough QT study using a 14-day dose-escalation \nregimen of 0.23 mg daily for 4 days, 0.46 mg daily for 3 days, 0.92 mg daily for 3 days, and 1.84 mg \ndaily for 4 days in healthy subjects, no evidence of QTc prolongation was observed as demonstrated \nby the upper boundary of the 95% one-sided confidence interval (CI) that was below the 10 ms. \nConcentration-QTc analysis for ozanimod and the major active metabolites CC112273 and \nCC1084037, using data from another Phase 1 study showed the upper boundary of the 95% CI for \nmodel derived QTc (corrected for placebo and baseline) below 10 ms at maximum concentrations \nachieved with ozanimod doses ≥0.92 mg once daily. \n\n\n\n13\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nOzanimod was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, active \ncontrolled clinical trials of similar design and endpoints, in patients with relapsing remitting MS \n(RRMS). Study 1 – SUNBEAM, was a 1-year study with patients continuing assigned treatment \nbeyond month 12 until the last enrolled patient completed the study. Study 2 -RADIANCE was a \n2-year study.\nThe dose of ozanimod was 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg given orally once daily, with a starting dose of \n0.23 mg on days 1-4, followed by an escalation to 0.46 mg on days 5-7, and followed by the assigned \ndose on day 8 and thereafter. The dose of IFN β-1a, the active comparator, was 30 mcg given \nintramuscularly once weekly.  \nBoth studies included patients with active disease as defined by having at least one relapse within the \nprior year, or one relapse within the prior two years with evidence of at least a gadolinium-enhancing \n(GdE) lesion in the prior year and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to \n5.0.  \nNeurological evaluations were performed at baseline, every 3 months, and at the time of a suspected \nrelapse. MRIs were performed at baseline (Studies 1 and 2), 6 months (SUNBEAM), 1 year (Studies \n1 and 2), and 2 years (RADIANCE). \nThe primary outcome of both SUNBEAM and RADIANCE was the annualised relapse rate (ARR) \nover the treatment period (minimum of 12 months) for SUNBEAM and 24 months for RADIANCE. \nThe key secondary outcome measures included 1) the number of new or enlarging MRI T2 \nhyperintense lesions over 12 and 24 months; 2) the number of MRI T1 GdE lesions at 12 and 24 \nmonths; and 3) the time to confirmed disability progression, defined as at least a 1-point increase from \nbaseline EDSS sustained for 12 weeks. Confirmed disability progression was prospectively evaluated \nin a pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2.\nIn SUNBEAM, 1346 patients were randomised to receive ozanimod 0.92 mg (n = 447), ozanimod \n0.46 mg (n= 451), or IFN β-1a IM (n = 448); 94% of ozanimod treated 0.92 mg, 94% of ozanimod \ntreated 0.46 mg, and 92% of IFN β-1a IM treated patients completed the study. In RADIANCE, 1313 \npatients were randomised to receive ozanimod 0.92 mg (n = 433), ozanimod 0.46 mg (n = 439), or \nIFN β-1a IM (n = 441); 90% of ozanimod treated 0.92 mg, 85% of ozanimod treated 0.46 mg, and \n85% of IFN β-1a IM treated patients completed the study. Patients enrolled across the 2 studies had a \nmean age of 35.5 years (range 18-55), 67% were female, mean time since MS symptom onset was 6.7 \nyears. The median EDSS score at baseline was 2.5; approximately one-third of the patients had been \ntreated with a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), predominately interferon or glatiramer acetate. At \nbaseline, the mean number of relapses in the prior year was 1.3 and 45% of patients had one or more \nT1 Gd-enhancing lesions (mean 1.7).  \n\nThe results for SUNBEAM and RADIANCE are shown in Table 3. The efficacy has been \ndemonstrated for  ozanimod 0.92 mg with a dose effect observed for study endpoints shown in Table \n3. Demonstration of efficacy for 0.46 mg was less robust since this dose did not show a significant \neffect for the primary endpoint in RADIANCE when considering the preferred negative binomial \nmodel strategy. \n\n\n\n14\n\nTable 3: Key clinical and MRI endpoints in RMS patients from Study 1 - SUNBEAM and \nStudy 2 - RADIANCE \n\nEndpoints SUNBEAM \n(≥ 1 year)*\n\nRADIANCE \n(2 year) \n\nOzanimod \n0.92 mg \n(n=447) \n\n% \n\nIFN β-1a IM \n30 mcg \n(n=448) \n\n% \n\nOzanimod \n0.92 mg \n(n=433) \n\n% \n\nIFN β-1a IM \n30 mcg \n(n=441) \n\n% \nClinical Endpoints \nAnnualized Relapse Rate \n(Primary Endpoint) \nRelative Reduction\n\n0.181 0.350 0.172 0.276\n\n48% (p<0.0001) 38% (p<0.0001)\n\nProportion Relapse-free** 78% \n(p=0.0002)1\n\n66% \n76% \n\n(p=0.0012)1\n64% \n\nProportion with 3-month \nConfirmed Disability \nProgression (CDP)†2\n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) \n\nProportion with 6-month \nCDP†2#\n\nHazard Ratio (95% CI)\n\n7.6% Ozanimod vs. 7.8% IFN β-1a IM  \n0.95 (0.679, 1.330) \n\n5.8% Ozanimod vs. 4.0% IFN β-1a IM \n1.413 (0.922, 2.165) \n\nMRI Endpoints \nMean number of new or \nenlarging T2 hyperintense \nlesions per MRI3\n\nRelative Reduction\n\n1.465 2.836 1.835 3.183\n\n48% (p<0.0001) 42% (p<0.0001)\n\nMean number of T1 Gd \nenhancing lesions4\n\nRelative Reduction\n\n0.160 0.433 0.176 0.373\n\n63% (p<0.0001) 53% (p=0.0006)\n* Mean duration was 13.6 months \n** Nominal p-value for endpoints not included in the hierarchical testing and not adjusted for multiplicity \n† Disability progression defined as 1-point increase in EDSS confirmed 3 months or 6 months later \n# In a post hoc analysis of 6-month CDP which included data from the open-label extension (Study 3), the HR (95% CI) was found to be \n1.040 (0.730, 1.482).)\n1 Log rank test  \n2 Prospectively planned pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 \n3 Over 12 months for Study 1 and over 24 months for Study 2 \n4 At 12 months for Study 1 and at 24 months for Study 2  \n\nIn SUNBEAM and RADIANCE, treatment with ozanimod 0.92 mg resulted in reductions in mean \npercent change from baseline in normalised brain volume compared to IFN beta-1a IM (-0.41% \nversus -0.61%, and -0.71% versus -0.94%, respectively, nominal p-value <0.0001 for both studies). \n\nThe studies enrolled DMT naive and previously treated patients with active disease, as defined by \nclinical or imaging features. Post-hoc analyses of patient populations with differing baseline levels of \ndisease activity, including active and highly active disease, showed that the efficacy of ozanimod on \nclinical and imaging endpoints was consistent with the overall population. \n\nLong-term Data \n\nPatients who completed the Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE studies could enter an open label \nextension study (Study 3 - DAYBREAK). Of the 751 patients initially randomised to ozanimod 0.92 \nmg and treated for up to 3 years, the (adjusted) ARR was 0.124 after the 2nd year of treatment. \n\n\n\n15\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nozanimod in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in MS (see section 4.2). \n\n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nOzanimod is extensively metabolised in humans to form a number of circulating active metabolites, \nincluding two major active metabolites, CC112273 and CC1084037, with similar activity and \nselectivity for S1P1 and S1P5 to the parent. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under \nthe curve (AUC) for ozanimod, CC112273, and CC1084037 increased proportionally over the dose \nrange of ozanimod 0.46 mg to 0.92 mg (0.5 to 1 time the recommended dose). Following multiple \ndosing, approximately 94% of circulating total active drug exposure are represented by ozanimod \n(6%), CC112273 (73%), and CC1084037 (15%). At a dose of 0.92 mg orally once daily in RRMS, \nthe geometric mean [coefficient of variation (CV%)] Cmax and AUC0-24h at steady state were 231.6 \npg/mL (37.2%) and 4223 pg*h/mL (37.7%), respectively, for ozanimod and 6378 pg/mL (48.4%) and \n132861 pg*h/mL (45.6%), respectively, for CC112273. Cmax and AUC0-24h for CC1084037 are \napproximately 20% of that for CC112273. Factors affecting CC112273 are applicable for CC1084037 \nas they are interconverting metabolites. \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe Tmax of ozanimod is approximately 6–8 hours. The Tmax of CC112273 is approximately 10 hours. \nAdministration of ozanimod with a high-fat, high-calorie meal had no effect on ozanimod exposure \n(Cmax and AUC). Therefore, ozanimod may be taken without regard to meals. \n\nDistribution \n\nThe mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution of ozanimod (Vz/F) was 5590 L (27%), indicating \nextensive tissue distribution. Binding of ozanimod to human plasma proteins is approximately 98.2%. \nBinding of CC112273 and CC1084037 to human plasma proteins is approximately 99.8% and 99.3%, \nrespectively. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nOzanimod is widely metabolised by multiple biotransformation pathways including aldehyde \ndehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase (ALDH/ADH), cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 \nand 1A1, and gut microflora and no single enzyme system predominates the overall metabolism. \nFollowing repeated dosing, the AUCs of the two major active metabolites CC112273 and \nCC1084037 exceed the AUC of ozanimod by 13-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. In vitro studies \nindicated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is responsible for the formation of CC112273 (via an \nintermediate minor active metabolite RP101075) while CYP2C8 and oxido-reductases are involved in \nthe metabolism of CC112273. CC1084037 is formed directly from CC112273 and undergoes \nreversible metabolism to CC112273. The interconversion between these 2 active metabolites is \nmediated by carbonyl reductases (CBR), aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1/1C2, and/or 3β- and \n11β- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD). \n\nElimination \n\nThe mean (CV%) apparent oral clearance for ozanimod was approximately 192 L/h (37%). The mean \n(CV%) plasma half-life (t1/2) of ozanimod was approximately 21 hours (15%). Steady state for \nozanimod was achieved within 7 days, with the estimated accumulation ratio following repeated oral \nadministration of 0.92 mg once daily of approximately 2. \nThe model-based mean (CV%) effective half-life (t1/2) of CC112273 was approximately 11 days \n(104%) in RMS patients, with mean (CV%) time to steady state of approximately 45 days (45%) and \n\n\n\n16\n\naccumulation ratio of approximately 16 (101%) indicating the predominance of CC112273 over \nozanimod. Plasma levels of CC112273 and its direct, interconverting metabolite CC1084037 declined \nin parallel in the terminal phase, yielding similar t1/2 for both metabolites. Steady state attainment and \naccumulation ratio for CC1084037 are expected to be similar to CC112273. \nFollowing a single oral 0.92 mg dose of [14C]-ozanimod, approximately 26% and 37% of the \nradioactivity was recovered from urine and faeces, respectively, primarily composed of inactive \nmetabolites. Ozanimod, CC112273, and CC1084037 concentrations in urine were negligible, \nindicating that renal clearance is not an important excretion pathway for ozanimod, CC112273, and \nCC1084037. \n\nPharmacokinetics in specific groups of patients \n\nRenal impairment \nIn a dedicated renal impairment trial, following a single oral dose of 0.23 mg ozanimod, exposures \n(AUClast) for ozanimod and CC112273 were approximately 27% higher and 23% lower, respectively, \nin patients with end stage renal disease (N=8) compared to patients with normal renal function \n(n = 8). Based on this trial, renal impairment had no clinically important effects on pharmacokinetics \nof ozanimod or CC112273. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. \n\nHepatic impairment \nIn a dedicated hepatic impairment trial, following a single oral dose of 0.23 mg ozanimod, exposures \n(AUClast) for ozanimod and CC112273 were approximately 11% lower and 31% lower, respectively, \nin patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A; n = 8) when compared to patients with \nnormal hepatic function (n = 7). Exposures (AUClast) for ozanimod and CC112273 were \napproximately 27% higher and 33% lower, respectively, in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh B; N=8) when compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n = 8). \nThese differences were not considered clinically meaningful. The pharmacokinetics of ozanimod \nwere not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is needed in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B). Use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment is contraindicated (Child-Pugh class C) (see section 4.3). \n\nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available on administration of ozanimod to patients aged 55 years and \nover. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo data are available on administration of ozanimod to paediatric or adolescent patients (< 18 years of \nage). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn repeated dose toxicology studies in mice (up to 4 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks) and monkeys (up to \n39 weeks), ozanimod markedly affected the lymphoid system (lymphopenia, lymphoid atrophy and \nreduced antibody response) and increased lung weights and the incidence of mononuclear alveolar \ninfiltrates, which is consistent with its primary activity at S1P1 receptors (see section 5.1). At the no \nobserved adverse effect levels in chronic toxicity studies, systemic exposures to the disproportionate \nmain active and persistent human metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 (see section 5.2), and even \nto the total human active drug (ozanimod combined with the mentioned metabolites), were lower than \nthose expected in patients at the maximum human dose of 0.92 mg ozanimod.  \n\nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n\nOzanimod and its main active human metabolites did not reveal a genotoxic potential in vitro and in \nvivo. \n\n\n\n17\n\nOzanimod was evaluated for carcinogenicity in the 6-month Tg.rasH2 mouse bioassay and the two-\nyear rat bioassay. In the two-year rat bioassay, no treatment-related tumours were present at any \nozanimod dose. However, metabolite exposure at the highest dose tested, was 62% of the human \nexposure for CC112273 and 18% of the human exposure for CC1084037 at the maximum clinical \ndose of 0.92 mg ozanimod. \nIn the 6-month Tg.rasH2 mouse study, hemangiosarcomas increased in a statistically-significant and \ndose-related manner. At the low dose (8 mg/kg/day), the hemangiosarcoma incidence was increased \nstatistically significant in males and in both males and females at the mid and high dose levels (25 \nmg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day) compared to concurrent controls. In contrast to rats and humans, mouse \nS1P1 receptor agonism results in sustained production of placental growth factor 2 (PLGF2) and \nsubsequently, persistent vascular endothelial cell mitoses, potentially leading to species specific \nhemangiosarcomas with S1P1 agonists. Therefore S1P1 receptor agonism related hemangiosarcomas \nin mice may be species specific and not predictive of a risk in humans.  \nNo other treatment-related tumours were present at any dose in the Tg.rasH2 mouse study. At the \nlowest dose tested, exposure in Tg.rasH2 mice to the disproportionate two main active human \nmetabolites was for CC112273 2.95 fold and for CC1084037 1.4 fold above the human exposure at \nthe maximum clinical dose of 0.92 mg ozanimod.  \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\nOzanimod had no effect on male and female fertility up to approximately 150-fold the systemic \nexposure to total active drug (combined ozanimod and the metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037) at \nthe maximum human dose of 0.92 mg ozanimod. \nEmbryofoetal development was adversely affected by maternal treatment with ozanimod, with low \n(rats) or no (rabbits) safety margins based on comparison of systemic exposures to total active drug, \nresulting in embryolethality and teratogenicity (generalised oedema/anasarca and malpositioned testes \nin rats, malpositioned caudal vertebrae and malformations of the great vessels in rabbits). The \nvascular findings in rats and rabbits are consistent with the expected S1P1 pharmacology.  \nPre- and post-natal development was not affected by ozanimod administration up to the 5.6-fold the \nsystemic exposure to total active drug at the maximum human dose of 0.92 mg ozanimod. Ozanimod \nand metabolites were present in rat milk. \n\n6.

Following the 7-day dose escalation, the maintenance dose is \n0.92 mg once daily, starting on Day 8. \n\n Re-initiation of therapy following treatment interruption \no The same dose escalation regimen described above is recommended when treatment is \n\ninterrupted for: \no 1 day or more during the first 14 days of treatment. \no more than 7 consecutive days between Day 15 and Day 28 of treatment. \no more than 14 consecutive days after Day 28 of treatment. \n\n If the treatment interruption is of shorter duration than the above, the treatment should be \ncontinued with the next dose as planned. \n\n Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: \nBefore first dose\no Perform baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to the first dose of Zeposia; \no Consider recent (within last 6 months) liver function test results for transaminase and \n\nbilirubin levels; \no Consider recent (within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy) complete \n\nblood cell count results, including lymphocyte count; \no Arrange ophthalmological assessment before starting Zeposia treatment in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus, uveitis, or a history of retinal disease. \no A negative pregnancy test result in women of childbearing potential must be confirmed \n\nprior to starting Zeposia treatment. \nUntil 6 hours after first dose for patients requiring first dose observation\no In patients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions (resting heart rate <55 bpm, \n\nsecond-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart \nfailure) \n\no Monitor for 6 hours after the first dose of Zeposia for signs and symptoms of \nsymptomatic bradycardia, with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement  \n\no Perform an ECG prior to and at the end of the 6-hour monitoring period. \no Extended monitoring may be required in the following situations \n\no heart rate less than 45 bpm \no heart rate is the lowest value post-dose, suggesting that the maximum decrease in \n\nheart rate may not have occurred yet \no evidence of a new onset second-degree or higher AV block at the 6- hour post-\n\ndose ECG \no QTc interval ≥500 msec \n\n When initiating Zeposia in patients with: \no History of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe \n\nuntreated sleep apnoea, history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia; \no Pre-existing significant QT interval prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec) or other \n\nrisks for QT prolongation, and patients on medicinal products other than beta-blockers \nand calcium-channel blockers that may potentiate bradycardia; \n\n\n\n23\n\no Current class Ia (eg, quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (eg, amiodarone, sotalol) \nantiarrhythmic medicinal products; \n\nA cardiologist should be consulted before initiating Zeposia to determine if Zeposia can safely \nbe initiated and to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy. \n\n Caution should be taken when initiating Zeposia in patients taking medicines known to decrease \nheart rate. \n\n Zeposia is contraindicated in patients with: \no Immunodeficient state predisposing to systemic opportunistic infections; \no Severe active infections, active chronic infections such as hepatitis and tuberculosis; \no Active malignancies; \no Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C); \no Myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, \n\ndecompensated heart failure requiring hospitalisation or New York Heart Association \n(NYHA) Class III/IV heart failure in the last 6 months; \n\no History or presence of second-degree AV block Type II or third-degree AV block or sick \nsinus syndrome unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker; \n\no During pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective \ncontraception; \n\no Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n Zeposia reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) \nshould be checked in all patients prior to initiation (within 6 months or after discontinuation of \nprior therapy) and monitored periodically during treatment with Zeposia Treatment should be \ninterrupted if lymphocyte count is confirmed as <0.2 x 109/l and the re-initiation of Zeposia can \nbe considered if the level reaches > 0.5 x 109/l. \n\n Zeposia has an immunosuppressive effect that predisposes patients to a risk of infection, \nincluding opportunistic infections, and may increase the risk of developing malignancies, \nincluding those of the skin. Patients should be carefully monitored, especially those with \nconcurrent conditions or known factors, such as previous immunosuppressive therapy. If this \nrisk is suspected, discontinuation of treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis. \no Treatment initiation in patients with severe active infection should be delayed until the \n\ninfection is resolved. Interruption of treatment during serious infections should be \nconsidered. Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory, or non-corticosteroid \nimmunosuppressive therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of additive \nimmune system effects.  \n\no Vigilance for basal cell carcinoma and other cutaneous neoplasms is recommended. \nCaution patients against exposure to sunlight without protection. Patients should not \nreceive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B-radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy. \n\n Patients should be instructed to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to their \nprescriber during and for up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. \no Prompt diagnostic evaluation should be performed in patients with symptoms of infection \n\nwhile receiving, or within 3 months of stopping, treatment with Zeposia  \no Prescribers should be vigilant for clinical symptoms including unexpected neurological or \n\npsychiatric symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected a \ncomplete physical and neurological examination (including the possibility of performing \nan MRI) should be performed and treatment with Zeposia should be withheld until PML \nhas been excluded. If PML is confirmed, treatment with Zeposia should be discontinued. \n\no The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. Check varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody \nstatus in patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of varicella or \n\n\n\n24\n\ndocumentation of a full course of varicella vaccination. If negative, VZV vaccination is \nrecommended at least 1 month prior to treatment initiation with Zeposia.  \n\n Zeposia is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \neffective contraception. \no A negative pregnancy test result must be confirmed prior to starting treatment in women \n\nof childbearing potential. It must be repeated at suitable intervals. \no Women of childbearing potential should be informed before treatment initiation about the \n\nrisks of Zeposia to the foetus, facilitated by the pregnancy-specific patient reminder card. \no Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during Zeposia \n\ntreatment and for at least 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. \no Zeposia should be stopped 3 months before planning a pregnancy. \no While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant \n\nwhile on treatment, Zeposia must be discontinued. Medical advice should be given \nregarding the risk of harmful effects to the foetus associated with Zeposia treatment and \nultrasonography examinations should be performed. \n\no Disease activity may possibly return when treatment with Zeposia is stopped due to \npregnancy or planning a pregnancy. \n\n Liver function (transaminase and bilirubin levels) should be monitored at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and \n12 during Zeposia therapy and periodically thereafter. \n\n Blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with Zeposia. \n\n Patient who present with visual symptoms of macular oedema should be evaluated and, if \nconfirmed, treatment with ozanimod should be discontinued. Patients with diabetes mellitus, \nuveitis or a history of retinal disease should undergo an ophthalmological evaluation prior to \ntreatment initiation with ozanimod and have follow up evaluations while receiving therapy.  \n\n Prescribers should provide patients/caregivers with the patient/caregiver guide and with the \npregnancy-specific patient reminder card  \n\nPatient/Caregiver’s Guide \nThe patient/caregiver’s guide shall contain the following key messages: \n What Zeposia is and how it works; \n What multiple sclerosis is; \n Patients should read the package leaflet thoroughly before starting treatment and should keep it \n\nin case they need to refer to it again during treatment; \n Importance of reporting adverse reactions; \n Patients should have a baseline ECG prior to receiving the first dose of Zeposia.  \n Zeposia should not be used if you have had a heart attack, angina, stroke or mini-stroke \n\n(transient ischaemic attack), or certain types of severe heart failure in the last 6 months or if you \nhave certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmia) – your doctor will check \nyour heart before starting treatment. Caution should be taken with concomitant use of medicines \nthat slow your heart rate. Therefore, patients should tell any doctor they see that they are being \ntreated with Zeposia. \n\n For patients with certain heart conditions, heart rate should be monitored for 6 or more hours \nafter the first dose of Zeposia, including hourly pulse and blood pressure checks. An ECG \nbefore and after the 6 hours should also be performed for these patients. \n\n Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, \nvertigo, nausea, or palpitations) after the first dose of Zeposia; \n\n Patients should inform their prescriber in case of treatment interruption, as the initial dose \nescalation regimen may need to be repeated, depending on duration of interruption and time \nsince initiation of Zeposia treatment; \n\n\n\n25\n\n Patients should report any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (such as \nsudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes) or accelerated \nneurological deterioration to their doctors; \n\n Patients are recommended to have varicella zoster (chickenpox) vaccination 1 month before \nstarting Zeposia treatment, if the patient is not protected and wants to be protected against the \nvirus; \n\n Signs and symptoms of infection, which should be immediately reported to the prescriber \nduring and up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia; \n\n Any symptoms of visual impairment should be reported immediately to the prescriber during \nand for up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia; \n\n Zeposia must not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential who are not \nusing effective contraception. Women of childbearing potential should: \no Be informed about serious risks to the foetus;\no Have a negative pregnancy test before starting Zeposia. It must be repeated at suitable \n\nintervals; \no Be informed about the requirement of using effective contraception during and for at least \n\n3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia; \no Be informed that disease activity may possibly return when treatment with Zeposia is \n\nstopped due to pregnancy or planning a pregnancy; \no Report immediately to the prescriber any (intended or unintended) pregnancy during and \n\nup to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. Ultrasonography \nexaminations should be offered if needed; \n\n A liver function test should be performed prior to treatment initiation; liver function monitoring \nshould be performed at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during Zeposia therapy, and should be \nperformed periodically thereafter; \n\n Blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with Zeposia; \n Zeposia may increase the risk of skin cancer. Patients should limit their exposure to sun light \n\nand UV (ultraviolet) light, by wearing protective clothing and applying regular sunscreen (with \nhigh sun protection factor). \n\nPregnancy-specific Patient Reminder Card \nThe pregnancy-specific patient reminder card (for women of childbearing potential) shall contain the \nfollowing key messages: \n Zeposia is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\neffective contraception; \n Doctors will provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding \n\nthe teratogenic risk of Zeposia and required actions to minimise this risk; \n Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception while taking Zeposia and for \n\n3 months after treatment discontinuation;  \n A pregnancy test must be carried out and negative results verified by the prescriber before \n\nstarting treatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals; \n If a woman becomes pregnant while on treatment, ozanimod must be discontinued. Medical \n\nadvice should be given regarding the risk of harmful effects to the foetus associated with \nZeposia treatment and ultrasonography examinations should be performed; \n\n Zeposia should be stopped 3 months before planning a pregnancy; \n Disease activity may possibility return when treatment with Zeposia is stopped due to \n\npregnancy or planning a pregnancy. \n\n\n\n26\n\nANNEX III \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n27\n\nA.

What Zeposia is and what it is used for \n\nWhat Zeposia is \nZeposia contains the active substance ozanimod that belongs to a group of medicines which can \nreduce the number of white blood cells (lymphocytes) circulating freely round the body. \n\nWhat Zeposia is used for \nZeposia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis \n(RRMS) with active disease. \n\nWhat multiple sclerosis is \n Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system (the body’s defenses, \n\nincluding white blood cells) wrongly attack the protective coat around the nerves in the brain \nand spinal cord. This stops the nerves from working properly and may result in symptoms such \nas: numbness, difficulty in walking, and problems with vision and balance. \n\n In relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, attacks on the nerve cells are followed by periods of \nrecovery. The symptoms may disappear during the recovery periods, but some problems may \nremain. \n\n\n\n37\n\nHow Zeposia works \nZeposia helps to protect against attacks on the nerves by stopping lymphocytes reaching the brain and \nspine where they could cause inflammation and damage the nerves protective coating.  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Zeposia \n\nDo not take Zeposia:\n if you are allergic to ozanimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if your healthcare professional has told you that you have a severely weakened immune system \n if you have had a heart attack, angina, stroke or mini-stroke (Transient Ischemic Attack - TIA), \n\nor certain types of severe heart failure in the last 6 months \n if you have certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmia) – your doctor will \n\ncheck your heart before starting treatment \n if you have severe infection such as hepatitis or tuberculosis \n if you have cancer  \n if you have severe liver problems \n if you are pregnant or a women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.\n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zeposia if: \n you have a slow heart rate or you are taking or have recently taken medicines that slow your \n\nheart rate (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers); \n you have untreated severe breathing problems when you sleep (severe sleep apnoea); \n you have problems with your liver; \n you have an infection; \n you have low levels of a type of white blood cell - called lymphocytes; \n you have never had, or are not sure if you have had chickenpox; \n you have recently had or are planning to have a vaccination; \n you or others notice worsening of your MS symptoms as well as any new or unfamiliar \n\nsymptoms. These may be due to a rare infection of the brain called progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML); \n\n you have ever had problems with your vision or other symptoms of build-up of fluid in the \ncentral area of the retina called the macula (a condition called macular oedema); \n\n you have inflammation of the eye (uveitis); \n you have diabetes (which can cause problems with your eyes); \n you have severe lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); \n\nBefore you start taking Zeposia, your doctor will check your heart using an electrocardiogram (ECG). \nIf you have certain heart conditions your doctor will monitor you for at least the first 6 hours after \nyour first dose. \n\nAs Zeposia can increase your blood pressure, your doctor may want to check your blood pressure \nregularly. \n\nWhile you are taking Zeposia (and for up to 3 months after you stop taking it), you may get infections \nmore easily. Any infection that you already have may get worse. Talk to your doctor if you develop \nan infection. \n\nAs Zeposia may increase the risk of skin cancer, you should limit your exposure to sun light and UV \n(ultraviolet) light, by wearing protective clothing and applying regular sunscreen (with high sun \nprotection factor). \n\n\n\n38\n\nDuring treatment with Zeposia, if you develop a severe headache, feel confused, or have seizures \n(fits) and loss of vision, speak to your doctor straight away. These symptoms may be due to a \nsyndrome called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \nIf used during pregnancy, Zeposia can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment with \nZeposia, your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure \nthat you are not pregnant.

It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming \npregnant while you are taking Zeposia. You must use effective contraception during treatment and for \n3 months after stopping treatment (see section “Pregnancy and breastfeeding”). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zeposia. \n\nWorsening of MS after stopping Zeposia treatment \nTell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with \nZeposia (see “If you stop taking Zeposia” in section 3). \n\nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents aged under 18 years.

Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months \n\nafter treatment. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nPregnancy \nDo not use Zeposia during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman \nwho could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception.

You must use effective \ncontraception while taking Zeposia and for at least 3 months after you stop taking it. Ask your doctor \nabout reliable methods of contraception.  \nYour doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become pregnant while taking \n\n\n\n39\n\nZeposia. \n\nIf you do become pregnant while taking Zeposia, tell your doctor straight away.
