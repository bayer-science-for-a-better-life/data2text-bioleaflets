This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nCablivi 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach vial of powder contains 10 mg of caplacizumab*. \nEach pre-filled syringe of solvent contains 1 mL of water for injections. \n \n* Caplacizumab is a humanised bivalent Nanobody produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant \nDNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nWhite lyophilised powder. \nThe solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nCablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older weighing \nat least 40 kg  experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in \nconjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nTreatment with Cablivi should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of patients with thrombotic microangiopathies.  \n \nPosology \n \nFirst dose \nIntravenous injection of 10 mg of caplacizumab prior to plasma exchange.  \n \nSubsequent doses \nDaily subcutaneous administration of 10 mg of caplacizumab after completion of each plasma \nexchange for the duration of daily plasma exchange treatment, followed by daily subcutaneous \ninjection of 10 mg of caplacizumab for 30 days after stopping daily plasma exchange treatment. \n \nIf at the end of this period there is evidence of unresolved immunological disease, it is recommended \nto optimise the immunosupression regimen and continue daily subcutaneous administration of 10 mg \nof caplacizumab until the signs of underlying immunological disease are resolved (e.g. sustained \nnormalisation of ADAMTS13 activity level). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nIn the clinical development program, caplacizumab has been administered daily for up to 65 days. No \ndata on re-treatment with caplacizumab are available.  \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose of Cablivi is missed, it can be administered within 12 hours. If more than 12 \nhours have passed since the dose was to have been given, the missed dose should NOT be \nadministered and the next dose should be administered per the usual dosing schedule. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). See section 4.4 \nfor special considerations in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly \nWhile experience with the use of caplacizumab in the elderly is limited, there is no evidence to suggest \nthat dose adjustment or special precautions are needed for elderly patients (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of caplacizumab in the paediatric population have not been established in \nclinical trials. The posology of Cablivi in adolescents of 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 \nkg is the same as in adults (see section 5.2). No recommendations can be made on the posology of \nCablivi for paediatric patients below 40 kg of body weight.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nThe first dose of Cablivi is to be administered as an intravenous injection. Subsequent doses are to be \nadministered via subcutaneous injection in the abdomen.  \n \nInjections into the area around the navel should be avoided and consecutive injections should not be \nadministered in the same abdominal quadrant. \n \nPatients or caregivers may inject the medicinal product after proper training in the subcutaneous \ninjection technique.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Cablivi before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nBleeding \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding \nIn case of active, clinically significant bleeding, treatment with Cablivi should be interrupted. If \nneeded, the use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate could be considered to correct hemostasis. \nCablivi should only be restarted upon the advice of a physician experienced in the management of \nthrombotic microangiopathies.  \n \nIncreased risk of bleeding \n \nIn the setting of concomitant use of oral anticoagulants or high dose heparin \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDue to a potential increased risk of bleeding, initiation or continuation of treatment with oral \nanticoagulants or high dose heparin requires a benefit/risk assessment and close clinical monitoring. \n \nIn the setting of concomitant use of anti-platelet agents and / or low molecular weight heparin \n(LMWH) \nWhile no increased risk of bleeding was observed in clinical trials, concomitant treatment with anti-\nplatelet agents and / or LMWH requires a benefit/risk assessment and close clinical monitoring. \n \nIn patients with coagulopathies \nDue to a potential increased risk of bleeding, use of Cablivi in patients with underlying coagulopathies \n(e.g. hemophilia, other coagulation factor deficiencies) is to be accompanied by close clinical \nmonitoring. \n \nIn patients undergoing surgery \nIf a patient is to undergo elective surgery or a dental procedure, the patient should be advised to \ninform the physician or dentist that they are using Cablivi, and treatment should be stopped at least 7 \ndays before the planned intervention. The patient should also notify the physician who supervises the \ntreatment with Cablivi about the planned procedure.  \nIf emergency surgery is needed, the use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate could be considered to \ncorrect hemostasis. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNo formal study with caplacizumab has been conducted in patients with severe acute or chronic \nhepatic impairment and no data regarding the use of caplacizumab in these populations are available. \nUse of Cablivi in this population requires a benefit/risk assessment and close clinical monitoring. \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNo interaction studies evaluating use of caplacizumab with oral anticoagulants (e.g. vitamin K \nantagonists, direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC] such as thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors) or \nhigh dose heparin have been performed (See section 4.4 In the setting of concomitant use of oral \nanticoagulants or high dose heparin).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of caplacizumab in pregnant women. Studies in guinea pigs showed no \neffect of caplacizumab on the dams or foetuses (see section 5.3).  \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cablivi during pregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \nThere are no data on the use of caplacizumab in breastfeeding women. It is unknown whether \ncaplacizumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the child cannot be excluded.  \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to abstain/discontinue from therapy, \ntaking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThe effects of caplacizumab on fertility in humans are unknown. In animal toxicology studies, no \nimpact of caplacizumab on male and female fertility parameters was observed (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nCablivi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions in clinical trials were epistaxis, headache and gingival bleeding. \nThe most common serious adverse reaction was epistaxis.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).   \n \nSystem organ class Very common Common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Cerebral infarction \n\nEye disorders  Eye Haemorrhage* \n\nVascular disorders  Haematoma* \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nEpistaxis* Dyspnoea, Haemoptysis* \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Gingival bleeding*  Haematemesis*, haematochezia*, \nmelaena*, upper gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage*, haemorrhoidal \nhaemorrhage*, rectal haemorrhage *, \nabdominal wall haematoma* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUrticaria  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Myalgia \n\nRenal And Urinary Disorders  Haematuria* \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\n Menorrhagia*, vaginal haemorrhage* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nPyrexia, Fatigue  Injection site haemorrhage*, injection site \npruritus, injection site erythema, injection \nsite reaction \n\nInjury, Poisoning And \nProcedural Complications \n\n Subarachnoid haemorrhage* \n\n*Bleeding events: see below  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nBleeding  \nIn clinical studies, bleeding events occurred in different body systems, independent of treatment \nduration. Although in some cases these events were serious and required medical attention, most were \nself-limited and all resolved. In case of active clinically significant bleeding, consider actions outlined \nin sections 4.4 and 4.9.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n6 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nIn case of overdose, based on the pharmacological action of caplacizumab, there is the potential for an \nincreased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding is recommended. \n(see section 4.4).  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antithrombotic agents, ATC code: B01AX07. \n \nMechanism of action \nCaplacizumab is a humanised bivalent Nanobody that consists of two identical humanised building \nblocks (PMP12A2hum1), genetically linked by a three-alanine linker, targeting the A1-domain of von \nWillebrand factor and inhibiting the interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets. As such, \ncaplacizumab prevents the ultralarge von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion, which is \ncharacteristic of aTTP. It also affects the disposition of von Willebrand factor, leading to transient \nreductions of total von Willebrand factor antigen levels and to concomitant reduction of factor VIII:C \nlevels during treatment. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nTarget inhibition \nThe pharmacologic effect of caplacizumab on target inhibition was assessed using two biomarkers for \nvon Willebrand factor activity; ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) and ristocetin cofactor \n(RICO). Full inhibition of von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet aggregation by caplacizumab is \nindicated by RIPA and RICO levels dropping below 10% and 20%, respectively. All clinical studies \nwith caplacizumab demonstrated rapid decreases in RIPA and/or RICO levels after the start of the \ntreatment, with recovery to baseline levels within 7 days of discontinuation. The 10 mg subcutaneous \ndose in patients with aTTP elicited full inhibition of von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet \naggregation, as evidenced by RICO levels of < 20% throughout the treatment period. \n \nTarget disposition \nThe pharmacologic effect of caplacizumab on target disposition was measured using von Willebrand \nfactor antigen and factor VIII clotting activity (factor VIII:C) as biomarkers. Upon repeated \nadministration of caplacizumab, a decrease of 30-50% in von Willebrand factor antigen levels was \nobserved in clinical studies, reaching a maximum within 1-2 days of treatment. Because von \nWillebrand factor acts as a carrier for factor VIII, reduced von Willebrand factor antigen levels \nresulted in a similar reduction in factor VIII:C levels. The reduced von Willebrand factor antigen and \nFVIII:C levels were transient and returned to baseline upon cessation of treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in adults experiencing an episode of aTTP were established \nin 2 randomised, controlled studies: Phase III study ALX0681-C301 \u201cHERCULES\u201d and Phase II \nstudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \u201cTITAN\u201d.  \n \nEfficacy \n \nStudy ALX0681-C301  \nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with an episode of aTTP were randomised 1:1 \nto receive either caplacizumab or placebo in addition to daily plasma exchange and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nimmunosuppression. Patients received a single intravenous bolus injection of 10 mg caplacizumab or \nplacebo prior to the first plasma exchange on study. This was followed by daily subcutaneous \ninjections of 10 mg caplacizumab or placebo after completion of each plasma exchange for the \nduration of the daily plasma exchange period and for 30 days thereafter. If at the end of this treatment \nperiod there was evidence of persistent underlying disease activity (indicative of an imminent risk for \nrecurrence), treatment could be extended weekly for a maximum of 4 weeks, together with \noptimisation of immunosuppression. If a recurrence occurred while on study drug treatment, patients \nwere switched to open-label caplacizumab. They were again treated for the duration of daily plasma \nexchange and for 30 days thereafter. If at the end of this treatment period there were was evidence of \nongoing underlying disease, open-label treatment with caplacizumab could be extended weekly for a \nmaximum of 4 weeks, together with optimisation of immunosuppression. Patients were followed for 1 \nmonth after discontinuation of treatment. In case of recurrence during the follow up period (i.e. after \nall study drug treatment had been stopped), there was no re-initiation of study drug and the recurrence \nwas to be treated according to the standard of care. \n  \nIn this study, 145 patients experiencing an episode of aTTP were randomised (72 to caplacizumab and \nto 73 placebo). Patient age ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a mean of 46 years. Half of the patients \nwere experiencing their first episode of aTTP. Baseline disease characteristics were typical of aTTP.  \n \nThe median treatment duration with caplacizumab in the double blind period was 35 days. \n \nTreatment with caplacizumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in time to platelet count \nresponse (p<0.01). Patients treated with caplacizumab were 1.55 times more likely to achieve platelet \ncount response at any given time point, compared to patients treated with placebo.  \n \nTreatment with caplacizumab resulted in a 74% reduction in the composite endpoint of the percentage \nof patients with aTTP-related death (0/72; placebo 3/73), exacerbation of aTTP (3/72; placebo 28/73), \nor at least one major thromboembolic event during study drug treatment (6/72; placebo 6/73) \n(p<0.0001). There were no deaths in the caplacizumab group and 3 deaths in the placebo group during \nthe study drug treatment period. \n \nThe proportion of patients with a recurrence of aTTP (exacerbation or relapse) in the overall study \nperiod (including the 28 day follow-up after discontinuation of study drug treatment) was 67% lower \nin the caplacizumab group (9/72; relapse : 6/72) compared to the placebo group (28/73; relapse 0/73) \n(p<0.001). \n \nNo patients treated with caplacizumab (0/72) were refractory to treatment (defined as absence of \nplatelet count doubling after 4 days of standard treatment and elevated LDH) compared to three \npatients treated with placebo (3/73).  \n \nTreatment with caplacizumab reduced the mean number of days of plasma exchange, the volume of \nplasma used, the mean length of Intensive Care Unit stay and the mean length of hospitalization \nduring the study drug treatment period. \n \n\n  Placebo Caplacizumab \nNumber of days of Plasma Exchange (days) N \n\nMean (SE) \n73 \n9.4 (0.81)     \n\n71 \n5.8 (0.51) \n\nTotal volume of plasma used (liter) N \nMean (SE) \n\n73 \n35.93 (4.17)         \n\n71 \n21.33 (1.62)                                                \n\nLength of hospitalization (days) N \nMean (SE) \n\n73 \n14.4 (1.22)                 \n\n71 \n9.9 (0.70) \n\nNumber of days in ICU N \nMean (SE) \n\n27 \n9.7 (2.12)                                      \n\n28 \n3.4 (0.40) \n\nN: number of patients evaluated; SE: Standard Error; ICU: Intensive Care Unit \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nImmunogenicity \nIn clinical studies, up to 9% of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA). No \nimpact on clinical efficacy was observed and no serious adverse events were found to be associated \nwith these ADA responses. \n \nPaediatric population \nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use and section 5.2 for results of modeling and \nsimulation studies for paediatric patients. There are no clinical data for paediatric patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab have been investigated in healthy subjects after single \nintravenous infusions and after single and repeated subcutaneous injections. Pharmacokinetics in \npatients with aTTP were investigated upon single intravenous and repeated subcutaneous injections.  \n \nPharmacokinetics of caplacizumab appear as non-dose proportional, as characterized by target-\nmediated disposition. In healthy volunteers receiving 10 mg caplacizumab subcutaneoulsy once daily, \nthe maximum concentration was observed at 6-7 hours post-dose and steady-state was reached \nfollowing the first administration, with minimal accumulation.  \n \nAbsorption \nAfter subcutaneous administration, caplacizumab is rapidly and almost completely absorbed \n(estimated F> 0.901) in the systemic circulation. \n \nDistribution \nAfter absorption, caplacizumab binds to the target and distributes to well perfused organs. In patients \nwith aTTP the central volume of distribution was estimated at 6.33 L. \n \nBiotransformation/Elimination \nThe pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab depend on the expression of the target von Willebrand factor. \nHigher levels of von Willebrand factor antigen, such as in patients with aTTP, increase the fraction of \ndrug-target complex retained in the circulation. The t1/2 of caplacizumab is, therefore, concentration- \nand target level-dependent. Target-bound caplacizumab is assumed to be catabolised within the liver, \nwhereas unbound caplacizumab is assumed to be renally cleared. \n \nCharacteristics in specific groups \nThe pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis \non pooled pharmacokinetic data. Body weight was allometrically included in the model. Differences in \nthe different subpopulations were investigated. In studied populations; gender, age, blood group and \nrace did not affect the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab.  \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo formal study of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab \nhas been conducted. In the population PK/PD model, renal function (CRCL) had a statistically \nsignificant effect resulting in limited increase in predicted exposure (AUCss) in severe renal \nimpairment. In the clinical studies of patients with TTP, those with renal impairment did not show \nadditional risk of adverse events.   \n \nPaediatric population  \nBased on data pooled from clinical studies in adults, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) \npopulation model was developed, describing the interaction between caplacizumab and von \nWillebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), in different adult populations following intravenous and \nsubcutaneous administration of caplacizumab at various dose levels. For children aged 2 to below 18 \nyears of age, simulations were performed based on this PK/PD model predicting that exposure and \nsuppression of vWF:Ag are expected to be similar to those in adults when 10 mg/day is used in \nchildren with a bodyweight of \u226540 kg, and when 5 mg/day is used in children with a bodyweight of \n<40 kg.  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nConsistent with its mode of action, toxicology studies of caplacizumab have shown an increased \nbleeding tendency in guinea pigs (haemorrhagic subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites) and \ncynomolgus monkeys (haemorrhagic subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites, nose bleed, \nexaggerated menstrual bleeding, haematoma at sites of animal handling or experimental procedures, \nprolonged bleeding at injection sites). Furthermore, pharmacology-related decreases of von \nWillebrand factor antigen, and consequently factor VIII:C, were noted in cynomolgus monkeys and, to \na lesser extent for factor VIII:C, in guinea pigs. \n \nAn embryo-foetal development study was conducted in guinea pigs, with no reported signs of toxicity. \nA follow-up toxicokinetic study in pregnant guinea pigs assessed exposure of caplacizumab in the \ndams and foetuses. The results indicated exposure to caplacizumab in dams and, to a much lesser \nextent, foetuses, with no reported effects on foetal development. Foetal exposure to caplacizumab in \nprimates and humans remains uncertain, as proteins lacking an Fc portion are not thought to freely \npass the placental barrier. \n \nNo studies have been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of caplacizumab, as such tests are \nnot relevant for biologicals. Based on a carcinogenicity risk assessment, dedicated studies were not \ndeemed necessary.  \n \nDedicated animal studies assessing the effects of caplacizumab on male and female fertility have not \nbeen performed. In repeat-dose toxicity tests in cynomolgus monkeys, no impact of caplacizumab on \nfertility parameters in male (testicular size, sperm function, histopathological analysis of testis and \nepididymis) and female (histopathological analysis of reproductive organs, periodic vaginal cytology) \nanimals was observed.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET  \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n  \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nCablivi 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\ncaplacizumab \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Cablivi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Cablivi  \n3. How to use Cablivi  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Cablivi  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cablivi is and what it is used for  \n \nCablivi contains the active substance caplacizumab. It is used to treat an episode of acquired \nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in adults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older \nweighing at least 40 kg. This is a rare blood clotting disorder in which clots form in small blood \nvessels. These clots can block blood vessels and damage the brain, heart, kidneys, or other organs. \nCablivi prevents the formation of these blood clots by stopping platelets in the blood from clumping \ntogether. By doing so, Cablivi reduces the risk of experiencing another episode of aTTP soon after the \nfirst.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Cablivi  \n \nDo not use Cablivi \n\u2022 if you are allergic to caplacizumab or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTell your doctor if you:  \n\u2022 bleed excessively during treatment. Your doctor may ask you to stop the treatment. The doctor \n\nwill say when you can start your treatment again. \n\u2022 are using anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists , rivaroxaban, apixaban (which treat blood \n\nclots). Your doctor will decide how you should be treated.  \n\u2022 are using anti-platelet agents such as aspirin, or low molecular weight heparin (which prevent \n\nblood clots). Your doctor will decide how you should be treated.  \n\u2022 have a bleeding disorder such as haemophilia. Your doctor will decide how you should be treated. \n\u2022 have severely reduced liver function. Your doctor will decide how you should be treated. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\u2022 are going to have an operation or dental treatment. Your doctor will decide if it can be postponed \nor if you should stop Cablivi before your surgery or dental treatment.  \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nCablivi is not recommended for children under 12 years and below 40 kg body weight.  \n \nOther medicines and Cablivi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. \n \nAlso tell your doctor if you are using an anticoagulant medicine such as vitamin K antagonists, \nrivaroxaban, or apixaban which treat blood clots or anti-platelet agents, such as aspirin, or low \nmolecular weight heparin which prevent blood clots. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to get pregnant. Use of Cablivi is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. Your doctor will advise you whether to discontinue \nbreastfeeding or not use Cablivi, considering the benefit of breastfeeding to the baby and the benefit of \nCablivi to you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCablivi is not expected to influence the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nCablivi contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Cablivi  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nTreatment with Cablivi is started by a doctor experienced in blood disorders.  \n \nThe recommended treatment is \n\n\u2022 first dose \n- 1 vial injected into a vein by a healthcare professional  \n- the medicine will be given before starting plasma exchange \n\n \n\u2022 subsequent doses: \n\n-  1 vial once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin of the belly)  \n-  the subcutaneous injection will be given after each daily plasma exchange   \n-  after the daily plasma exchange finishes, your treatment with Cablivi will continue for at least \n\n30 days with injection of 1 vial once daily.  \n-  your doctor may ask you to continue daily treatment until the underlying signs of your disease \n\nare resolved \n \nYour doctor may decide that you or your caregiver may inject Cablivi. In this case, your doctor or \nhealthcare provider will train you or your caregiver on how to use Cablivi. \n \nInstructions for use  \nThe first injection of Cablivi into your vein must be given by a healthcare professional. Instructions \nfor healthcare professionals on how to inject Cablivi into your vein are  at the end of the leaflet. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nFor each injection, use a fresh kit package to prepare the injection solution. Do not try to inject Cablivi \nuntil you have been taught how to do so by a healthcare professional. Never use the kit for another \ninjection. \n \nStep 1 - Cleaning  \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Prepare a clean flat surface for placing the kit package. \n\u2022 Make sure you have a disposal container at hand. \n \nStep 2 - Before use  \n\u2022 Make sure the kit package is complete. \n\u2022 Check the expiry date. Do not use if the expiry date has passed.  \n\u2022 Do not use the kit if the packaging or the items in it are damaged in any way. \n\u2022 Place all components of the kit on the clean flat surface.  \n\u2022 If the kit was not stored at room temperature, allow the vial and the syringe to reach room \n\ntemperature (15\u00b0C \u2013 25\u00b0C) by letting them stand at room temperature for a few minutes. Do not \nwarm them up in any other way. \n  \n\nStep 3 - Disinfect the rubber stopper  \n\u2022 Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the vial. Do not use the vial if the green plastic cap is \n\nmissing. \n\u2022 Clean the exposed rubber stopper using one of the alcohol pads provided and allow it to dry for \n\na few seconds. \n\u2022 After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any surface.  \n\n \nStep 4 - Attaching the adapter  \n\u2022 Take the packed vial adapter and remove the paper cover. Leave the adapter in its opened \n\nplastic packaging. Do not touch the adapter itself.  \n\n \n\u2022 Place the adapter over the vial, while keeping the adapter in its plastic packaging. \n\u2022 Press down firmly until the adapter snaps into place, with the adapter spike going through the \n\nvial stopper. Leave the adapter attached to the vial, still in its outer packaging. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nStep 5 - Prepare the syringe  \n\u2022 Holding the syringe in your hand, break off the white cap with your other hand.  \n\u2022 Do not use the syringe if this white cap is missing, loose or damaged. \n\n \n\u2022 Do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to come into contact with any surfaces. \n\u2022 Place the syringe on the clean flat surface.  \n \nStep 6 - Connect syringe with adapter and vial  \n\u2022 Take the vial with the attached adapter. \n\u2022 Remove the plastic packaging from the adapter by holding the vial with one hand, pressing the \n\nsides of the adapter packaging with your other hand, and then lifting the packaging upwards. \nTake care that the adapter does not come away from the vial. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\u2022 Hold the adapter with the attached vial with one hand. Place the tip of the syringe on the \nconnector part of the vial adapter.  \n\n\u2022 Gently lock the syringe onto the vial by turning it clockwise until resistance is felt. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nStep 7 - Prepare the solution  \n\u2022 Keep the vial standing vertically on the surface with the syringe pointing downwards. \n\u2022 Slowly push the syringe\u2019s plunger down until the syringe is empty. Do not remove the syringe \n\nfrom the vial. \n\u2022 With the syringe still connected to the vial adapter, gently swirl the vial with connected syringe \n\nuntil the powder is dissolved. Avoid foaming. Do not shake the vial. \n\n \n\u2022 Allow the vial with connected syringe to stand on the surface for 5 minutes at room temperature \n\nto allow the solution to completely dissolve. The plunger may rise up by itself again - this is \nnormal.  \n\n\u2022 Go to step 8 immediately after these 5 minutes. \n \nStep 8 - Draw up solution  \n\u2022 Check the solution for particles. All powder must be dissolved and the solution must be clear. \n\u2022 Slowly press the syringe\u2019s plunger fully down.  \n\u2022 Turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - upside down. \n\u2022 While keeping it vertical, slowly pull the plunger to transfer all the solution into the syringe. Do \n\nnot shake it. \n\n \nStep 9 - Prepare the syringe for administration  \n\n \n\u2022 Turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - right-side up (with the syringe at the top). \n\nDisconnect the filled syringe from the adapter by holding the adapter in one hand and gently \nturning the syringe counter-clockwise. \n\n\u2022 Put the vial and the attached adapter into the supplied disposal container. \n\u2022 Do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to touch the surface. Place the syringe on the clean flat \n\nsurface. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\u2022 Go to step 10 to inject caplacizumab under the skin of the belly. Instructions for healthcare \nprofessionals on how to inject Cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. \n\n \nStep 10 - Attach the needle  \n\u2022 Unpack the needle by tearing the paper cover off the needle packaging and removing the needle \n\nwith protective cap.  \n\n \n\u2022 Without removing the needle cap, attach the needle to the syringe by turning clockwise until \n\nresistance is felt.  \n\u2022 Pull back the needle safety shield. \n\u2022 Check the content of the syringe. Do not use the medicine if you see any cloudiness, clumps \n\nor anything else that looks abnormal. Contact your doctor or nurse if this happens. \n \nStep 11 - Prepare injection site for injection under the skin  \n\n \n\u2022 Select a suitable place (\u2018injection site\u2019) on your belly for injection under your skin.Avoid the \n\narea around the belly button. Select a different injection site from the one you used on the \nprevious day to help the skin to recover after the injection.' \n\n\u2022 Use the second alcohol pad to clean the injection site you have chosen. \n \n\nStep 12 - Administration  \n\u2022 Carefully remove the needle protection cap from the needle and throw it away. Make sure the \n\nneedle does not touch anything before the injection. \n\u2022 Hold the syringe at eye level with the needle pointing upwards. \n\u2022 Remove any air bubbles by tapping the side of the syringe with your finger to make the bubbles \n\nrise towards the tip. Then, slowly push the plunger until a small amount of liquid comes out of \nthe needle. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n\u2022 Gently pinch the cleaned skin between your thumb and forefinger to make a fold.  \n\n \n\u2022 Hold this skin fold during the entire injection. \n\u2022 Insert the full length of the needle into the skin fold at an angle as shown in the illustration. \n\u2022 Press the plunger down as far as it goes. \n\n \n\u2022 Pull out the needle at the same angle you inserted it. Do not rub the injection site. \n \nStep 13 - After administration  \n\u2022 Immediately after the injection, move the needle safety shield over the needle, until it clicks into \n\nplace. \n\n \n\u2022 Put the syringe with the needle in a disposal container. \n \nIf you use more Cablivi than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely since one vial contains only a single dose. Tell your doctor if you think you \nhave had an overdose.  \n \nIf you forget to use Cablivi \nIf you miss a dose you should still take it if it is within 12 hours of the scheduled time. If more than 12 \nhours have passed since the dose should have been given, do not take the missed dose, but inject the \nnext dose at the usual time. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nIf you stop using Cablivi \nTo get the most benefit from your treatment, it is important to use Cablivi as prescribed and for as long \nas your doctor tells you to use it. Please talk to your doctor before you stop the treatment because \nstopping it too early can cause your condition to come back. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n  \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if any of the following serious side effects occur.  \nLong or excessive bleeding.  \nYour doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change your treatment.  \n \nSide effects in a clinical study were reported with the following frequencies: \n \nVery common, may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 bleeding gums \n\u2022 fever \n\u2022 tiredness \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 nosebleeds \n\u2022 hives \n \nCommon, may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 bleeding from eye \n\u2022 vomiting blood  \n\u2022 blood in the stools \n\u2022 black, tarry stools \n\u2022 bleeding from the stomach  \n\u2022 bleeding hemorrhoids \n\u2022 rectal bleeding \n\u2022 injection site reactions: rash, itching and bleeding  \n\u2022 bleeding in brain as evidenced by severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of \n\nconsciousness, fever, sometimes seizures and neck stiffness or neck pain \n\u2022 muscle pain \n\u2022 stroke \n\u2022 blood in urine \n\u2022 excessive bleeding during periods \n\u2022 vaginal bleeding  \n\u2022 coughing blood \n\u2022     shortness of breath  \n\u2022 bruise \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you experience any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

to use cablivi", "Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. treatment with cablivi is started by a doctor experienced in blood disorders. the recommended treatment is first dose - 1 vial injected into a vein by a healthcare professional - the medicine will be given before starting plasma exchange subsequent doses: - 1 vial once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin of the belly) - the subcutaneous injection will be given after each daily plasma exchange - after the daily plasma exchange finishes, your treatment with cablivi will continue for at least 30 days with injection of 1 vial once daily. - your doctor may ask you to continue daily treatment until the underlying signs of your disease are resolved your doctor may decide that you or your caregiver may inject cablivi. in this case, your doctor or healthcare provider will train you or your caregiver on how to use cablivi. instructions for use the first injection of cablivi into your vein must be given by a healthcare professional. instructions for healthcare professionals on how to inject cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. for each injection, use a fresh kit package to prepare the injection solution. do not try to inject cablivi until you have been taught how to do so by a healthcare professional. never use the kit for another injection. step 1 - cleaning wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. prepare a clean flat surface for placing the kit package. make sure you have a disposal container at hand. step 2 - before use make sure the kit package is complete. check the expiry date. do not use if the expiry date has passed. do not use the kit if the packaging or the items in it are damaged in any way. place all components of the kit on the clean flat surface. if the kit was not stored at room temperature, allow the vial and the syringe to reach room temperature (15 25) by letting them stand at room temperature for a few minutes. do not warm them up in any other way. step 3 - disinfect the rubber stopper remove the plastic flip-off cap from the vial. do not use the vial if the green plastic cap is missing. clean the exposed rubber stopper using one of the alcohol pads provided and allow it to dry for a few seconds. after cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any surface. step 4 - attaching the adapter take the packed vial adapter and remove the paper cover. leave the adapter in its opened plastic packaging. do not touch the adapter itself. place the adapter over the vial, while keeping the adapter in its plastic packaging. press down firmly until the adapter snaps into place, with the adapter spike going through the vial stopper. leave the adapter attached to the vial, still in its outer packaging. step 5 - prepare the syringe holding the syringe in your hand, break off the white cap with your other hand. do not use the syringe if this white cap is missing, loose or damaged. do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to come into contact with any surfaces. place the syringe on the clean flat surface. step 6 - connect syringe with adapter and vial take the vial with the attached adapter. remove the plastic packaging from the adapter by holding the vial with one hand, pressing the sides of the adapter packaging with your other hand, and then lifting the packaging upwards. take care that the adapter does not come away from the vial. hold the adapter with the attached vial with one hand. place the tip of the syringe on the connector part of the vial adapter. gently lock the syringe onto the vial by turning it clockwise until resistance is felt. step 7 - prepare the solution keep the vial standing vertically on the surface with the syringe pointing downwards. slowly push the syringe's plunger down until the syringe is empty. do not remove the syringe from the vial. with the syringe still connected to the vial adapter, gently swirl the vial with connected syringe until the powder is dissolved. avoid foaming. do not shake the vial. allow the vial with connected syringe to stand on the surface for 5 minutes at room temperature to allow the solution to completely dissolve. the plunger may rise up by itself again - this is normal. go to step 8 immediately after these 5 minutes. step 8 - draw up solution check the solution for particles. all powder must be dissolved and the solution must be clear. slowly press the syringe's plunger fully down. turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - upside down. while keeping it vertical, slowly pull the plunger to transfer all the solution into the syringe. do not shake it. step 9 - prepare the syringe for administration turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - right-side up (with the syringe at the top). disconnect the filled syringe from the adapter by holding the adapter in one hand and gently turning the syringe counter-clockwise. put the vial and the attached adapter into the supplied disposal container. do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to touch the surface. place the syringe on the clean flat surface. go to step 10 to inject caplacizumab under the skin of the belly. instructions for healthcare professionals on how to inject cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. step 10 - attach the needle unpack the needle by tearing the paper cover off the needle packaging and removing the needle with protective cap. without removing the needle cap, attach the needle to the syringe by turning clockwise until resistance is felt. pull back the needle safety shield. check the content of the syringe. do not use the medicine if you see any cloudiness, clumps or anything else that looks abnormal. contact your doctor or nurse if this happens. step 11 - prepare injection site for injection under the skin select a suitable place ('injection site') on your belly for injection under your skin.avoid the area around the belly button. select a different injection site from the one you used on the previous day to help the skin to recover after the injection.' use the second alcohol pad to clean the injection site you have chosen. step 12 - administration carefully remove the needle protection cap from the needle and throw it away. make sure the needle does not touch anything before the injection. hold the syringe at eye level with the needle pointing upwards. remove any air bubbles by tapping the side of the syringe with your finger to make the bubbles rise towards the tip. then, slowly push the plunger until a small amount of liquid comes out of the needle. gently pinch the cleaned skin between your thumb and forefinger to make a fold. hold this skin fold during the entire injection. insert the full length of the needle into the skin fold at an angle as shown in the illustration. press the plunger down as far as it goes. pull out the needle at the same angle you inserted it. do not rub the injection site. step 13 - after administration immediately after the injection, move the needle safety shield over the needle, until it clicks into place. put the syringe with the needle in a disposal container. if you use more cablivi than you should an overdose is unlikely since one vial contains only a single dose. tell your doctor if you think you have had an overdose. if you forget to use cablivi if you miss a dose you should still take it if it is within 12 hours of the scheduled time. if more than 12 hours have passed since the dose should have been given, do not take the missed dose, but inject the next dose at the usual time. if you stop using cablivi to get the most benefit from your treatment, it is important to use cablivi as prescribed and for as long as your doctor tells you to use it. please talk to your doctor before you stop the treatment because stopping it too early can cause your condition to come back. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "cablivi", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine",
