See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe vaccine is a clear to opalescent, translucent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus (See section 4.4). \n \nCelvapan should be used in accordance with Official Guidance \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account available data from clinical studies in healthy subjects \nwho received two doses of Celvapan (H1N1)v. \n \nFrom clinical studies limited immunogenicity and safety data are available for Celvapan (H1N1)v in \nhealthy adult and older subjects and in children (see section 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). \n \nAdults and older people \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren aged 6 to 35 months \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nChildren aged less than 6 months \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nFor further information, see sections 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Celvapan, complete the vaccination course \nwith Celvapan (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh, depending on the muscle mass. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this vaccine. \n \nSee section 4.4 for Special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity \n(other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance(s), to any of the excipients and to trace \nresidues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following CELVAPAN \nvaccination (see section 4.8). Such reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple \nallergies and in patients with no known allergy. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nCelvapan should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nThere are no data with Celvapan using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Celvapan with \nother (H1N1)v vaccines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Celvapan with other vaccines. However, if \nco-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of Celvapan in pregnancy and lactation has been assessed in a limited number of pregnant \nwomen. \n \nData from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do \nnot suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines \n(A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of Celvapan may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into \naccount official recommendations. \n \nCelvapan may be used in lactating women. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may affect the ability to \ndrive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\uf0b7 Clinical trials with Celvapan (H1N1)v \n \nAdults and Older People \n \nIn a clinical study the 7.5 \u00b5g dose of Celvapan (H1N1)v was administered to adults \naged 18 to 59 years (N = 101) and older people over 60 years of age (N = 101). Safety data after the \nfirst and second vaccination suggest a similar safety profile to that reported for the influenza vaccines \nusing a H5N1 strain. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with Celvapan (H1N1)v in a healthy adult and older people are \nlisted in the table below. \n \n\nClinical Adverse Reactions (H1N1)v Studies \nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Preferred MedDRA Term Frequency1 \n\nINFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS Nasopharyngitis Common \nPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Insomnia Common \nNERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Headache \n\nDizziness \nVery Common \nCommon \n\nEYE DISORDERS Eye irritation Common \nRESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND \nMEDIASTINAL DISORDERS \n\nPharyngolaryngeal pain Common \n\nGASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Abdominal pain Common \nSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS \nTISSUE DISORDERS \n\nHyperhidrosis \nRash \nUrticaria \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL AND \nCONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS \n\nArthralgia \nMyalgia \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nGENERAL DISORDERS AND \nADMINISTRATION SITE \nCONDITIONS \n\nFatigue \nPyrexia \nChills \nMalaise \nInjection site reactions \n\uf0b7 Injection site pain \n\uf0b7 Injection site induration \n\uf0b7 Injection site erythema \n\uf0b7 Injection site swelling \n\uf0b7 Injection site movement impairment \n\nVery Common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nADR frequency is based upon the following scale: Very Common (\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 - \n< 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 - < 1/100), Rare (\u2265 1/10,000 - < 1/1,000), Very Rare (< 1/10,000) \n \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age \n \nIn a clinical trial 51 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 51 children aged 3 to 8 years were \nadministered the 7.5 \u00b5g dose of Celvapan (H1N1)v.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Celvapan is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Celvapan \n3. How Celvapan is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Celvapan \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Celvapan is and what it is used for \n \nCelvapan is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defense system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Celvapan \n \nYou should not receive Celvapan: \n \n\uf0b7 if you previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of Celvapan \n\nor to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: formaldehyde, \nbenzonase, sucrose. \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n\n \nTake special care with Celvapan: \n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you are given Celvapan if \n \n\uf0b7 you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to formaldehyde, benzonase, or to sucrose. (see section 6. \nFurther information). \n\n\uf0b7 you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 \u00b0C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still \nbe vaccinated with Celvapan. \n\n\uf0b7 you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then \nbe poor. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n\uf0b7 you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few \nweeks after vaccination with Celvapan the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the \ndoctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Celvapan. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a bleeding condition or a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nCelvapan. This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and Celvapan \n \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. \n \nThere is no information on administration of the vaccine Celvapan with other vaccines. However, if \nthis cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should \nbe aware that the side effects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. Your \ndoctor will discuss with you whether you should be given Celvapan. \n \nThe vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may affect your ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \n \n3. How Celvapan is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). The vaccine should never be \ngiven into a vein. \n \nAdults and older people: \n \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nA second dose of the vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years of age: \n \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nA second dose of the vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months: \n \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nWhen Celvapan is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Celvapan (and not another vaccine \nagainst (H1N1)v) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Celvapan can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies in adults and older people \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Celvapan (H1N1)v in clinical studies in adults, \nincluding older people. In the clinical studies, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. \n \nVery common: \n \n\uf0b7 Headache \n\uf0b7 Feeling tired \n \nCommon: \n \n\uf0b7 Runny nose and sore throat \n\uf0b7 Insomnia (difficulty sleeping) \n\uf0b7 Dizziness \n\uf0b7 Eye irritation \n\uf0b7 Stomach pain \n\uf0b7 Increased sweating \n\uf0b7 Rash, hives \n\uf0b7 Joint and muscle pain \n\uf0b7 Fever, shivering, generally feeling unwell \n\uf0b7 Pain, redness, swelling or a hard lump where the injection was given, reduced movement in the \n\narm injected \n \nSide effects from clinical studies in children \n \nChildren and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age \n \nIn a clinical study the frequency and type of side effects after the first and second injection were \nbasically similar to that seen in the adult and older population using Celvapan. However, some \ndifferences in frequency and type of side effects were observed. Specifically, headache, vertigo \n(spinning feeling), cough, feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain in the arms or legs and tiredness were \nobserved commonly in children and adolescents. \n \nAdditionally, in the case of the 9 to 17 year olds pain at the injection site was very common. \n \nIn children aged 6 to 35 months disturbed sleep and fever were very common, and decreased appetite, \nrestlessness, irritability, crying and drowsiness were common. \n \nSide effects from the Pandemic Observational Study with CELVAPAN (H1N1)v \n \nResults from a clinical study done on marketed vaccine confirmed the safety profile as observed in the \nclinical studies. The following adverse reactions were reported at a higher frequency category than in \nthe other clinical studies: \n \nAdults aged 18 years and older: \n \nVery common: Pain and redness where the injection was given, aching muscles \nUncommon: Influenza like illness \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nChildren and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years: \n \nVery common: Feeling tired, headache \nUncommon: Cough \n \nChildren aged 6 months to 5 years: \n \nVery common: Redness where the injection was given, drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, crying \n \n\uf0b7 Clinical trials with a similar vaccine \n \nIn a study with a similar influenza vaccine (containing a H5N1 vaccine strain) that included healthy \nadults and older people, subjects with a weakened immune system and patients with long-term \nconditions, the safety profile was similar to that in healthy adults. \n \n\uf0b7 Side effects observed during post-marketing surveillance \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Celvapan (H1N1)v in adults and children during the \npandemic flu vaccination program. \n \n- Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease in blood \n\npressure which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Your doctors know that this might happen and \nwill have emergency treatment ready to use. \n\n- Fits due to fever \n- Reduced skin sensitivity \n- Pain in arms and or legs (in the majority of cases reported as pain in the vaccination arm) \n- Flu-like illness \n- Swelling of tissue just below the skin. \n \n\uf0b7 Side effects observed with flu vaccines given routinely every year \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given \nroutinely every year to prevent flu. They may also happen with Celvapan. \n \nUncommon: \n \n\uf0b7 generalized skin reactions including urticaria (hives) \n \nRare: \n \n\uf0b7 severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves \n\uf0b7 low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising \n \nVery rare: \n \n\uf0b7 vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \n\nproblems) \n\uf0b7 neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), \n\nneuritis (inflammation of nerves) and a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome \n \nIf any of these side effects occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any of the side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V.

studies, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. very common: headache feeling tired common: runny nose and sore throat insomnia (difficulty sleeping) dizziness eye irritation stomach pain increased sweating rash, hives joint and muscle pain fever, shivering, generally feeling unwell pain, redness, swelling or a hard lump where the injection was given, reduced movement in the arm injected side effects from clinical studies in children children and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age in a clinical study the frequency and type of side effects after the first and second injection were basically similar to that seen in the adult and older population using celvapan. however, some differences in frequency and type of side effects were observed. specifically, headache, vertigo (spinning feeling), cough, feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain in the arms or legs and tiredness were observed commonly in children and adolescents. additionally, in the case of the 9 to 17 year olds pain at the injection site was very common. in children aged 6 to 35 months disturbed sleep and fever were very common, and decreased appetite, restlessness, irritability, crying and drowsiness were common. side effects from the pandemic observational study with celvapan (h1n1)v results from a clinical study done on marketed vaccine confirmed the safety profile as observed in the clinical studies. the following adverse reactions were reported at a higher frequency category than in the other clinical studies: adults aged 18 years and older: very common: pain and redness where the injection was given, aching muscles uncommon: influenza like illness 28 children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years: very common: feeling tired, headache uncommon: cough children aged 6 months to 5 years: very common: redness where the injection was given, drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, crying clinical trials with a similar vaccine in a study with a similar influenza vaccine (containing a h5n1 vaccine strain) that included healthy adults and older people, subjects with a weakened immune system and patients with long-term conditions, the safety profile was similar to that

program. - allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure which, if untreated, may lead to shock. your doctors know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment ready to use. - fits due to fever - reduced skin sensitivity - pain in arms and or legs (in the majority of cases reported as pain in the vaccination arm) - flu-like illness - swelling of tissue just below the skin. side effects observed with flu vaccines given routinely every year the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. they may also happen with celvapan. uncommon: generalized skin reactions including urticaria (hives) rare: severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising very rare: vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney
