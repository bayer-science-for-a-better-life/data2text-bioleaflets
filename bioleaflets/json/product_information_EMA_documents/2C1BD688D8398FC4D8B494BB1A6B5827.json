NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInbrija 33 mg inhalation powder, hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 42 mg levodopa. \nEach delivered dose contains 33 mg levodopa.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, hard capsule. \n \nWhite opaque capsules containing white powder, with “A42” printed in black on the cap of the \ncapsule and two black bands printed on the body of the capsule. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nInbrija is indicated for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in \nadult patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPatients should be on a stable levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa or benserazide) \nregimen before starting Inbrija. \n \nPatients selected for treatment with Inbrija should be able to recognize the onset of their 'OFF' \nsymptoms and be capable of preparing the inhaler or else have a responsible care giver able to prepare \nthe inhaler for them when required. \n \nInbrija should be inhaled when symptoms, motor or non-motor, of an OFF period start to return. \n \nThe recommended dose of Inbrija is 2 hard capsules up to 5 times per day each delivering 33 mg \nlevodopa. The maximum daily dose of Inbrija should not exceed 10 capsules (330 mg). It is not \nrecommended to take more than 2 capsules per OFF period. Exceeding the recommended dose may \nlead to increased levodopa associated adverse reactions. \n \nAbrupt dose reduction or withdrawal of any levodopa medicinal product should be carefully observed, \nparticularly in patients who are also receiving neuroleptics. See section 4.4 regarding withdrawal \nemergent hyperpyrexia and confusion. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Inbrija is required for elderly patients (≥65 years). There is only limited data \navailable in very elderly patients (≥75 years). \n \nRenal impairment \nInbrija has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. It is recommended to administer this \nmedicinal product cautiously to patients with severe renal disease. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nInbrija has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. It is recommended to administer this \nmedicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Inbrija in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No data \nare available.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor inhalation use only. Inbrija hard capsules must not be swallowed. \n \nThe Inbrija inhaler is to be thrown away after all the capsules have been used. \n \nThe capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. \n \nThe physician or other healthcare professional should instruct the patient how to administer the \nproduct correctly. A summary of how to use Inbrija is provided below. \n- A complete dose is 2 capsules taken one right after the other. \n- The patient should load 1 capsule into the Inbrija inhaler, breathe in and hold their breath for \n\n5 seconds. The patient should hear the capsule “whirl”. \n- The used capsule should be removed from the Inbrija inhaler and the second capsule loaded into \n\nthe inhaler. The maximum time between inhalation of the powder from the first and second \ncapsules should not exceed 10 minutes. \n\n- It is important to advise the patient that if they do not hear or feel the capsule “whirl” while \ninhaling they may need to take a deeper, longer breath, breathing in again using the same \ncapsule. \n\n \nDetailed instructions for use for the patients are included in the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Narrow-angle glaucoma. \n- Phaeochromocytoma. \n- Co-administration with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These inhibitors \n\nshould already be discontinued for at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy due to the \nestablished underlying levodopa therapy (see section 4.5). \n\n- A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic \nrhabdomyolysis. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBronchospasm in patients with lung disease \n \nBecause of the risk of bronchospasm, use of levodopa inhalation powder in patients with asthma, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease is not \nrecommended. There is limited data regarding chronic effect of Inbrija in respiratory compromised \npatients. \n \nCentral Nervous System (CNS) effects and mental disturbances \n \nSomnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset \nLevodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset (see section 4.7). \nSudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has \nbeen reported very rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndriving or operating machines during treatment (see section 4.7). Patients who have experienced \nsomnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. \nFurthermore, a reduction of dose or termination of therapy may be considered. \n \nWithdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion \nA symptom complex that resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterised by elevated \ntemperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other \nobvious aetiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or \nchanges in the background dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, any abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal \nof any levodopa medicinal product should be carefully observed, particularly in patients who are also \nreceiving neuroleptics. \n \nMental disturbances \nPatients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioural changes, which may be \nsevere, including psychotic-like and suicidal behaviour during levodopa treatment or after starting or \nincreasing the dose of levodopa. This abnormal thinking and behaviour can consist of one or more of a \nvariety of manifestations including anxiety, depression, paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, \nconfusion, psychotic-like behaviour, disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. \nPatients with a major psychotic disorder or a history of psychotic disorder must be treated cautiously \nwith a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In \naddition, certain medicinal products used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of \nParkinson’s disease and may decrease the effectiveness of levodopa. Concomitant use of \nantipsychotics should be monitored carefully for worsening of Parkinson’s motor symptoms especially \nwhen D2-receptor antagonists are used (see section 4.5). \n \nImpulse control disorders \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with levodopa. Review of treatment is \nrecommended if such symptoms develop. \n \nDyskinesia \nInbrija may cause dyskinesia. Adjustment of levodopa therapy or other medicinal products used for \nthe treatment of Parkinson’s disease may be considered. \n \nCardiovascular ischaemic events \n \nInbrija should be administered with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Care should \nbe exercised when Inbrija is administered to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have \nresidual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac function should be monitored with particular \ncare in such patients during the initiation of treatment with Inbrija. \n \nPeptic ulcer disease \n \nLevodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (because \nof the possibility of upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage). \n \nGlaucoma \n \nLevodopa may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Patients with chronic \nglaucoma may be treated cautiously with levodopa provided the intraocular pressure is well-controlled \nand the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMelanoma \n \nEpidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a higher risk (2- to \napproximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the \nincreased risk observed was due to Parkinson’s disease or other factors, such as medicinal products \nused to treat Parkinson’s disease, is unclear. \nPeriodic skin examinations are recommended to monitor for melanoma in patients receiving Inbrija. \n \nLaboratory monitoring \n \nAbnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline \nphosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase \n(LDH), and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and positive Coombs test have also \nbeen reported. \n \nInterference with test \n \nLevodopa may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for \ndetermination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-\nnegative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. \nCases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor \ntherapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and \nurine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on levodopa or levodopa/dopa-\ndecarboxylase inhibitor therapy. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \n \nLevodopa can cause orthostatic hypotension. Inbrija should be used with caution in case of \nconcomitant use of medicinal products that may cause orthostatic hypotension, e.g. anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent respiratory infection \n \nThere is limited data available on the use of Inbrija during a respiratory infection. Based on individual \nassessments of the severity of the intercurrent respiratory infection Inbrija may be continued or \ndiscontinued until the respiratory symptoms resolve (see section 4.2).  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNon-selective Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors \n \nThe use of non-selective MAO inhibitors with levodopa is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Any non-\nselective MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least 14 days prior to initiating levodopa. \n \nSelective Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors \n \nThe use of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g. rasagiline, selegiline, and safinamide) with levodopa may \nbe associated with orthostatic hypotension. Patients who are taking these medicinal products should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nDopamine D2 receptor antagonists and isoniazid \n \nDopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, \nmetoclopramide) and isoniazid may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa. Patients who are taking \nthese medicinal products should be monitored for worsening Parkinson’s symptoms (see section 4.4). \n \nAntihypertensives \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nSymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when combinations of levodopa and a dopa-\ndecarboxylase inhibitor are added to the treatment of patients already receiving certain \nantihypertensives. Dose adjustment of the antihypertensive medicinal products may be required during \nconcomitant use of Inbrija. \n \nAnticholinergics \n \nAnticholinergic medicinal products can work synergistically with levodopa, in order to improve \ntremor. Concurrent use can, however, cause a worsening of involuntary motor disorders. \nAnticholinergic medicinal products may impair the effect of oral levodopa medicinal products, due to \na delayed absorption. A dose adjustment of levodopa may be required.  \n \nCOMT inhibitors \n \nThe addition of entacapone to a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor has been demonstrated to \nincrease the levodopa bioavailability by 30%. A dose adjustment of levodopa may be required with \nconcomitant use of COMT inhibitors. \n \nTricyclic antidepressants \n \nThere have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting \nfrom the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. \n \nAmantadine \n \nConcurrent administration of levodopa and amantadine may increase confusion, hallucinations, \nnightmares, gastro-intestinal disturbances, or other atropine-like side effects. Psychotic reactions have \nbeen observed in patients receiving amantadine and levodopa. \n \nLocal or systemic pulmonary medicinal products \n \nInteractions of Inbrija with local or systemic pulmonary medicinal products were not investigated \nbecause Inbrija is not recommended in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of levodopa in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Inbrija is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLevodopa is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of levodopa in \nnewborns/infants. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Inbrija. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of levodopa on human fertility. Animal studies indicated no effect on \nfertility (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLevodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Certain side effects \nsuch as sleepiness and dizziness, that have been reported with other forms of levodopa medicinal \nproducts, may affect some patients’ ability to drive or use machines. \n \nPatients being treated with levodopa medicinal products and presenting with somnolence and/or \nsudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where \nimpaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. use machines), \nuntil such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile  \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported in the Inbrija clinical studies were cough (15.6%), fall \n(8.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.8%), dyskinesia (5.7%) and sputum discoloured (2.8%). \nSerious adverse reactions of allergic oedema have been reported with levodopa medicinal products but \nnot in clinical studies with Inbrija. A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome \nand rhabdomyolysis may occur with levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor medicinal products, \nalthough no cases have been identified in clinical studies with Inbrija.

Due to cough, 2% of subjects withdrew from the \nclinical studies with Inbrija. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe acute symptoms of levodopa overdose can be expected to arise from dopaminergic \noverstimulation. Using more than one dose of Inbrija (2 capsules) to treat the same OFF period may \nresult in CNS disturbances, with an increasing likelihood of cardiovascular disturbance (e.g. \nhypotension, tachycardia) and more severe psychiatric problems at higher doses. \n \nPatients should be monitored and supportive care should be provided. Patients should receive \nelectrocardiographic monitoring for the development of arrhythmias; if needed, appropriate \nantiarrhythmic therapy should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BA01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLevodopa is a precursor of dopamine, and is given as dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson’s \ndisease. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe effectiveness of Inbrija for the treatment of OFF episodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease \ngiven on top of background dopaminergic treatment was evaluated in a 12-week, randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, double-blind study. Subjects had to be able to recognise OFF periods and to \nhandle the device. \n \nA total of 114 patients were randomised and treated with Inbrija 66 mg (two 33 mg capsules) and \n112 patients received placebo. When experiencing an OFF period, subjects could use inhaled levodopa \non demand up to five times a day. Apomorphine was not allowed as background medicinal product. At \nbaseline, patients had at least 2 hours of OFF time per day, and the levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase \ninhibitor medicines did not exceed 1,600 mg levodopa per day. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in Unified Parkinson’s Disease \nRating Scale (UPDRS) part III score 30 minutes post dose at week 12. The UPDRS part III is designed \nto assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings (e.g. tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural \ninstability) in patients with Parkinson’s disease. This endpoint was assessed in a clinical setting, i.e. \npatients had to take their regular morning oral levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor dose and then \nvisit the clinic 2-5 hours post dose. If an OFF period emerged subjects received placebo or inhaled \nlevodopa. UPDRS-III was assessed before and 30 minutes post dose administration. Reduction in \nmean daily OFF time and improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale, a \npatient reported outcome of the overall improvement and satisfaction with Inbrija treatment, and \nResponders ON were the main secondary endpoints. Results are presented in Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 2: Baseline features and results of the efficacy endpoints  \n\nParameters Placebo n = 112 \n\nInbrija \n66 mg \n\nn = 114 \nSubject features   \nAge 63 years 64 years \nDuration PD 97 months 96 months \nBaseline Levodopa dose 841 mg 819 mg \nUPDRS-III score during OFF \nperiod n = 95\n\na n = 94a \n\nPre-dose score 32.1 29.0 \nChange at 30 min -5.91 -9.83 \nDiff.

No notable differences between \nplacebo and Inbrija were observed in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following the first \ndose. \n \nThe effect of Inbrija on pulmonary function was also evaluated in patients with Parkinson’s disease \ntreated with an oral levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor in a 12-month, randomised, controlled, \nopen-labeled study. A total of 271 patients were treated with Inbrija 66 mg (two 33 mg capsules), and \n127 patients in an observational control group were observed on their regular oral medication regimen \nfor the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry and carbon \nmonoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) every 3 months in both groups. After 12 months, the average \nreduction in FEV1 from baseline was the same in both groups (-0.1 L). The change from baseline for \nDLCO was compared between the Inbrija treatment group and the observational cohort; at the end of \n12 months, there was no significant difference in the change from baseline between Inbrija group and \nthe observational cohort in DLCO. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nInbrija in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) and carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg \nimmediate release tablets was evaluated in 24 healthy volunteers in a fasted state receiving a total of \n50 mg carbidopa every 8 hours. \n \nThe median time to maximal plasma concentration of levodopa was 30 minutes after a dose of Inbrija \n66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) compared to 45 minutes after a dose of carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg \nimmediate release tablets. The dose-normalised relative bioavailability of a single 66 mg emitted dose \nof Inbrija was 88.0% (90% CI: 80.3, 96.4) when compared to a single oral carbidopa/levodopa \n25 mg/100 mg dose. \n \nThe mean maximal plasma concentration at 10 minutes (C10min) and at peak concentration (Cmax) of \nlevodopa following administration of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) was 418 ng/mL and \n696 ng/mL, respectively, with exposure over 4 hours (AUC0-4 h) of 1,280 ng●h/mL. \n \nDistribution \n \nApparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 168 L for Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLevodopa is extensively metabolised to various metabolites. The two major metabolic pathways are \ndecarboxylation by L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and O-methylation by catechol-O-\nmethyltransferase (COMT). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the major levodopa metabolites 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), 3,4-\ndihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were studied following \nadministration of a single inhaled dose of Inbrija and a single oral carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg \nimmediate release tablet. The metabolite profile following Inbrija inhalation was not substantially \ndifferent than that observed following oral carbidopa/levodopa administration. The peak metabolite \nconcentrations and total exposure achieved after Inbrija administration did not exceed those observed \nfollowing an oral carbidopa/levodopa dose. \n \nThe impact of the amount of circulating dopa-decarboxylase at the end of an oral carbidopa/levodopa \ndosing interval on the efficacy of Inbrija was not studied. \n \nElimination \n \nIn the presence of carbidopa, the apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of levodopa following a \nsingle administration of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) was 2.3 hours and comparable to that \nfollowing an oral dose of carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg immediate release tablets of 1.9 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nInbrija shows dose proportional pharmacokinetics of levodopa from 13 mg to 122 mg. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nInbrija has not specifically been studied in patients with renal impairment. It is recommended to \nadminister this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe renal disease (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nInbrija has not specifically been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. It is recommended to \nadminister this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nGender \n \nA clinical study was performed with Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) in 24 healthy subjects \n(13 men and 11 women). After administration of Inbrija the Cmax and AUC0-24 h for women were 42.2% \nhigher and 48.8% higher than for men, respectively. After correcting the parameters for body weight, \nthe gender difference after each treatment was no longer significant: the body-weight adjusted Cmax \nand AUC0-24 h after a dose of Inbrija in women were 9.7% and 15.1% higher than men. Most of the \ngender difference is accounted for by differences in body weight. No dose adjustment is required \nbased on gender. \n \nSmoking \n \nA clinical study was performed with Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) administered to 56 healthy \nsubjects (31 non-smokers and 25 smokers). After administration of Inbrija the Cmax and AUC0-24 h was \n11% to 12% higher for smokers than for non-smokers. No dose adjustment is required based on \nsmoking status. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nLevodopa has caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. \nNo effects were seen on male or female reproductive organs in repeat dose toxicology studies in mice, \nrats or monkeys with levodopa alone. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nInbrija 33 mg inhalation powder, hard capsules \nlevodopa \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Inbrija is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Inbrija \n3. How to use Inbrija \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Inbrija \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Inbrija is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Inbrija is levodopa. Inbrija is a medicine used by inhalation for treating the \nworsening of your symptoms during the “off periods” of Parkinson’s disease.  \n \nParkinson’s disease affects your movement and it is treated with a medicine that you take regularly. \nDuring off periods your usual medicine does not control the condition well enough and movement is \nlikely to be more difficult. \n \nYou should continue taking your main medicine for Parkinson’s disease and use Inbrija to control \nworsening of symptoms (such as inability to move) during off periods. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Inbrija \n \nDo not use Inbrija: \n- if you are allergic to levodopa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you get blurred vision, red eyes, severe eye and head pain, halos around lights, pupils of your \n\neyes that are larger than normal size and feel sick. If you have any of these symptoms, you may \nhave a eye condition called narrow angle glaucoma, which occurs suddenly: do not take \nInbrija and get urgent medical attention. \n\n- if you have a rare tumour of the adrenal gland called phaeochromocytoma. \n- if you are taking certain antidepressant medicines called non-selective MAO inhibitors (e.g. \n\nisocarboxazid and phenelzine). You must stop taking these medicines at least 14 days before \nstarting treatment with Inbrija. See also under “Other medicines and Inbrija”. \n\n- if you have previously suffered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a life-threatening \nreaction to certain medicines used to treat severe mental disorders or if you have suffered from \nnon-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, a rare muscle disorder in which damaged muscle breaks down \nrapidly. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nGet urgent medical help if you have tremors, agitation, confusion, fever, rapid pulse, or dizziness \n\n\n\n26 \n\nand fainting upon standing up, or you notice that your muscles get very rigid or jerk violently. These \nmay be symptoms of “withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia”.
