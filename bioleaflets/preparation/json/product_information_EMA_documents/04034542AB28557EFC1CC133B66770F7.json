NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nApealea 60 mg powder for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of powder contains 60 mg of paclitaxel. \n \nAfter reconstitution, each mL of solution contains 1 mg of paclitaxel (micellar). \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach vial contains 3.77 mg (0.164 mmol) sodium. After reconstitution, each mL of solution contains \nup to approximately 3.60 mg (0.157 mmol) sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for infusion. \n \nGreenish-yellow to yellow powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nApealea in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with first \nrelapse of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube \ncancer (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nApealea should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units \nspecialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents. It should not be interchanged with other \npaclitaxel formulations. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Apealea is 250 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) given as an intravenous \ninfusion over 1 hour followed by carboplatin every three weeks for six cycles. The recommended dose \nof carboplatin is AUC = 5–6 mg/mL×min. \n \nDose adjustments and delays during treatment \nPatients who experience neutropenia (neutrophil count < 1.5 × 109/L), febrile neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 109/L) during treatment should have the next treatment cycle \ndelayed until neutrophil counts recover to ≥ 1.5 × 109/L and platelets recover to ≥ 100 × 109/L. For \nApealea, dose reductions of initially 50 mg/m2 and additionally 25 mg/m2 should be considered for \nsubsequent courses (see Table 1).  \n \nIn the case of febrile neutropenia or low platelet count (< 75 × 109/L), the dose of carboplatin should \nbe reduced by 1 AUC unit in the treatment cycles following recovery. For appropriate use of \ncarboplatin, the prescriber is advised to consult the prescribing information for carboplatin as well. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose reductions or/and delays should be considered as a result of any clinically significant adverse \nreaction as presented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1. Treatment delay and dose level reductions for adverse drug reactions \n\nObservationa Delay of next cycle \nApealea/carboplatin \n\nApealea dose for subsequent courses \n(mg/m2)b \n\nHaematological toxicityb \n\nneutrophil count < 1.5 × 109/L \nor \nplatelet count < 100 × 109/L \nor \nfebrile neutropenia \n\nWithhold treatment until \nrecovery \n\nStandard dose: 250 \n\nPossible dose reductions: \n\nFirst dose level reduction:  200 \n\nSecond dose level reduction: 175 \n\nNervous system disorders \n\ngrade ≥ 2 peripheral sensory \nneuropathy \nor \ngrade ≥ 2 motor neuropathy \n\nWithhold treatment until \nrecovery to < grade 2 \n\nDose reduction: \n\nFirst dose level reduction:  200 \n\nPossible dose reduction: \n\nSecond dose level reduction: 175 \n\nAll other adverse reactions \n\nAny grade 4 toxicity Discontinue treatment \n\nAny grade 3 toxicity except \nnausea, vomiting and \ndiarrhoea \n\nWithhold treatment until \nsymptoms resolve to \ngrade ≤ 1 \n\nPossible dose reductions: \n\nFirst dose level reduction:  200 \n\nSecond dose level reduction: 175 \na Grade of the adverse reaction is defined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \nEvents (CTCAE). \nb The dose of carboplatin should be reduced by 1 AUC unit for treatment cycles following the \noccurrence of febrile neutropenia or low platelet count (< 75 × 109/L). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 10 × ULN) may be treated with the same doses as patients with \nnormal hepatic function.  \n \nFor patients with moderate to severe impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 5 × ULN and \nAST ≤ 10 × ULN), a 20% reduction in dose is recommended. The reduced dose may be escalated to \nthe dose for patients with normal hepatic function if the patient is tolerating the treatment for at least \ntwo cycles (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients with total bilirubin > 5 × ULN or AST > 10 × ULN, there are insufficient data to permit \ndosage recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with mildly or moderately impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n89−60 mL/min or GFR 59−30 mL/min, respectively) may be treated with Apealea without a dose \nmodification. Patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) should not be treated with \npaclitaxel (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nElderly \nNo additional dosage reductions, other than those for all patients, are recommended for patients \n65 years and older.  \n \nOf the 391 patients with ovarian cancer in the randomised study who received Apealea in combination \nwith carboplatin, 13% were between 65 and 74 years old. In this limited number of patients, anorexia, \nfatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and diarrhoea were observed more \nfrequently compared to patients younger than 65 years. Limited data are available on use in patients \n≥ 75 years (2% of the patients in the study). \n \nNon-Caucasian patients \nThere are limited data of Apealea in non-Caucasian patients and current data is insufficient to \nrecommend additional dose adjustments (see section 4.4). If neuropathy is observed, follow dose \nreduction recommendations in Table 1. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of paclitaxel in the paediatric population for the indications of epithelial \novarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer. The safety and efficacy of \nApealea in children and adolescents aged 0−17 years has not been established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nApealea is for intravenous use. \n \nAfter reconstitution of the powder, the solution for infusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. The \nsolution should be administered by an intravenous infusion over approximately one hour \n(120−140 drops/min). Administration sets containing a 15 µm polyamide fluid filter should be used. It \nis important to flush the infusion set and catheter/cannula before and after the administration using the \nsolution for reconstitution in order to avoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue and to \nensure administration of the complete dose. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \nBaseline neutrophil count < 1.5 × 109/L. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematology \n \nPaclitaxel causes myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia). Neutropenia is a dose-dependent and \ndose-limiting adverse reaction. Therefore, frequent complete blood cell counts should be performed \nduring treatment with Apealea. In the pivotal study, about a third of the patients received granulocyte \ncolony stimulating factor (GCSF) to treat neutropenia and clinicians should consider whether \nindividual cases could benefit from GCSF. Patients should not be treated with subsequent cycles until \nneutrophils recover to ≥ 1.5 × 109/L and platelets recover to ≥ 100 × 109/L. Patients with low \nneutrophil count should be made aware of the increased risk of infections. The risk of \nmyelosuppression is increased due to the combination use with carboplatin. Dose recommendations \nfor Apealea as well as for carboplatin in the case of myelosuppression should be followed (see section \n4.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nNeuropathy \n \nPeripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy are very common adverse reactions. For \nCTCAE grade ≥ 2 sensory or motor neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to < grade 2, \nfollowed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment have not been studied with Apealea but may be at increased risk of \ntoxicity, particularly from myelosuppression. Administration in patients with hepatic impairment \ndefined as total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 5 × ULN and AST ≤ 10 × ULN (see section 4.2) should therefore be \nperformed with caution and they should be closely monitored with regard to increased liver \nimpairment and myelosuppression. Patients that have total bilirubin > 5 × ULN or AST > 10 × ULN \nshould not be treated with paclitaxel. \n \nGastrointestinal symptoms \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions are very common. If patients experience nausea, vomiting and \ndiarrhoea following the administration of Apealea, they may be treated with antiemetics and/or \nantidiarrhoeal agents. Premedication may be considered in patients who have previously experienced \ngastrointestinal symptoms when being treated with cytotoxic medicinal products. \n \nInfusion-associated reactions \n \nLocal reactions at the infusion site are very common during Apealea infusions. The infusion site \nreactions observed include pain, phlebitis, discolouration, redness, oedema and rash. These reactions \nare more common on the first infusion and may be improved by slowing the rate of infusion. Patients \nwho experience severe pain or other reactions to the infusion of Apealea are recommended to be \nconsidered for a central venous catheter. Care should be taken to avoid accidental administration into \nthe surrounding tissue during intravenous administration. If any sign of extravasal injection occurs, \ntake immediate action: terminate the infusion, aspirate fluid from the catheter/cannula before the \nneedle is withdrawn, infuse the affected area with sterile saline or lactated or acetated Ringer’s \nsolution and closely monitor the area. To avoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue \nand to ensure intravenous delivery of the complete dose, flush the infusion set and catheter/cannula \nbefore as well as after the administration. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nMost hypersensitivity reactions related to Apealea are mild to moderate and mainly occur as skin and \nsubcutaneous tissue disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, but serious \nhypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock have been reported. Minor symptoms such as \nflushing or skin reactions do not require interruption of therapy. Moderate cases may require \npremedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines and/or H2 antagonists for the following treatment \ncycles. Severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnoea requiring bronchodilators, \nangioedema or generalised urticaria require immediate discontinuation of paclitaxel and initiation of \nsymptomatic treatment. Patients experiencing severe reactions should not be re-challenged with \npaclitaxel. Patients should be observed closely during treatment, particularly those patients who \npreviously suffered hypersensitivity reactions with any taxane formulation. \n \nThe true incidence, severity and time to onset of hypersensitivity reactions due to Apealea could not \nbe established during clinical development due to the combination treatment with carboplatin. Delayed \nreactions related to paclitaxel occurring during or after infusion of carboplatin cannot be excluded. \n \nAlopecia \n \nAlopecia is a very common adverse reaction and occurs early in treatment. It can have a marked \nimpact on the patients’ self-image and quality of life and patients should be counselled about the \n\n\n\n6 \n\nlikelihood of this adverse effect and on what measures might be available to mitigate it, for example \nthe use of cold caps. In studies with Apealea, 45% of patients reported alopecia during therapy. \n \nCardiotoxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in some patients receiving Apealea. In some of the cases, the patients \nhad previously been exposed to cardiotoxic medicinal products such as doxorubicin or had underlying \ncardiac history. These patients should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of \ncardiac events. \n \nPatients 65 years and older \n \nThere was no marked difference in overall tolerability between the 65–74 age group and younger \npatients. Limited data are available on use in patients ≥ 75 years. In view of this, and of the potential \nfor frailty and co-morbidities, elderly patients should be carefully monitored. \n \nRace \n \nThere are limited data on the use of Apealea in non-Caucasian patients. However, studies in breast \ncancer patients treated with paclitaxel-containing regimens indicate a possible increased risk of \nneuropathy in non-Caucasian patients (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nWhen reconstituted, this medicinal product contains up to approximately 1.6 g sodium per dose \n(0.9 g/m2 BSA; 3.6 mg per mL), equivalent to 80% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake \nof 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo studies have been performed to evaluate drug-drug interactions between Apealea and other \nmedicinal products. \n \nThe metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and \nCYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel \nconcomitantly with medicines known to inhibit either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole and \nother imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimetidine, ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher \npaclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to induce either \nCYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is not \nrecommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitaxel exposures. \n \nApealea contains a mixture of two retinoic acid derivatives as excipients. In vitro studies using human \nmicrosomes have shown these derivatives to have inhibitory activity on CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nand to a lesser extent on CYP2D6. In the absence of in vivo studies addressing inhibition of CYP2B6 \nand CYP2C9, the concomitant use of Apealea and substances metabolised primarily by these CYP \nenzymes should be exercised with caution. \n \nApealea is indicated to be used in combination with carboplatin (see section 4.1). Apealea should be \nadministered first, then carboplatin. Based on literature data, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic \ninteraction between paclitaxel and carboplatin is expected. \n \nClinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed between paclitaxel and cisplatin. \nWhen paclitaxel is given before cisplatin, the safety profile of solvent-based paclitaxel is consistent \nwith that reported for single-agent use. When solvent-based paclitaxel was given after cisplatin, \npatients showed a more profound myelosuppression and an approximately 20% decrease in paclitaxel \nclearance. A similar effect can be anticipated for Apealea (paclitaxel micellar). Patients treated with \n\n\n\n7 \n\npaclitaxel and cisplatin may have an increased risk of renal failure as compared to cisplatin alone in \ngynaecological cancers. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for six months \nafterwards. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in pregnant women. Paclitaxel is suspected to \ncause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Paclitaxel should not be used during pregnancy unless the \nclinical condition requires this treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPaclitaxel is excreted in human milk. Because of potential serious adverse reactions in children being \nbreastfed, Apealea is contraindicated during lactation. Breast-feeding must be discontinued for the \nduration of therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals being treated with paclitaxel have shown decreased fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nApealea has moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Apealea may cause adverse \nreactions such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to drive or \nuse machinery. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they feel tired or dizzy. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common clinically significant adverse reactions associated with the use of Apealea are \nneutropenia, gastrointestinal disorders, peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia/myalgia, and infusion site \nreactions. Approximately 86% of patients experienced adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of undesirable effects listed in Table 2 is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2 lists adverse reactions associated with the administration of Apealea in combination with \ncarboplatin observed in a clinical study (N = 391) and adverse reactions from post-marketing \nexperience. The latter ones may be attributed to paclitaxel regardless of the treatment regimen. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2.

(paclitaxel micellar) at a dose of \n250 mg/m2 in combination with carboplatin or with solvent-based paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 in \ncombination with carboplatin (N = 391 in each arm). Overall, there were higher rates of serious \nadverse events with paclitaxel micellar (41%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (27%). In both \ngroups, the majority of the serious adverse events were haematological toxicities. There were no \ndifferences in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score between the two \nstudy groups at any time during or after treatment (mainly score 0 or 1). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nAlmost all patients treated with Apealea had neutropenia of some grade, 79% of the patients had grade \n3 or 4. Neutropenia as a serious adverse reaction occurred in 29% of the patients and febrile \nneutropenia occurred in 3% of the patients. Neutropenia resolved to ≥ 1.5 × 109/L before the next \ncourse of treatment. Almost all patients experienced anaemia, decreased platelet count and decreased \nwhite blood cell count of any grade during the treatment period (98%, 93% and 98%, respectively). \nAnaemia as serious adverse event occurred in 5% of the patients, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in \n3% and 6% of the patients, respectively. \n \nIn comparison to the patients receiving solvent-based paclitaxel, there were more patients in the group \nreceiving paclitaxel micellar who experienced haematological toxicities with grade 3 and 4. \nNeutropenia occurred in 79% and 66%, leukopenia in 53% and 34%, thrombocytopenia in 18% and \n10%, and anaemia in 24% and 14% of the patients in the treatment arms receiving either paclitaxel \nmicellar or solvent-based paclitaxel, respectively. \n \nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multi-organ failure, \nhas been reported. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea (38%), vomiting (22%) and diarrhoea (15%) were among the most commonly reported \nadverse reactions in the study. \n \nNervous system disorders \nPeripheral neuropathies (including the preferred terms neuropathy peripheral, peripheral motor \nneuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, polyneuropathy, and \npolyneuropathy in malignant disease) were reported in 29% of the patients and were mostly (98%) \nmild to moderate (CTCAE grade ≤ 2). The average time to onset was 53 days from the first dose. \nPeripheral sensory neuropathy represented the most common reaction and was reported in 16% of \npatients. Other associated reactions were reported in 10% of the patients and were mostly (98%) mild \nto moderate (CTCAE grade ≤ 2). Paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia were the most common ones. During \nthe course of the pivotal study, 46% of the peripheral neuropathies as well as the majority (78%) of the \nassociated reactions resolved. The dose-dependency of frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was \nnot studied for Apealea, but has been observed for other paclitaxel formulations in other indications. \nFurther, it has been demonstrated that peripheral neuropathies can persist beyond 6 months of \npaclitaxel discontinuation. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nMost hypersensitivity reactions related to Apealea were mild to moderate (see section 4.4). The \nfrequency of paclitaxel-related hypersensitivity reactions was similar in both groups (5% of the \npatients receiving paclitaxel micellar and 7% of the patients receiving solvent-based paclitaxel), \nwhereas a higher frequency of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions was observed in the group \nreceiving paclitaxel micellar (12% vs 7%). As a result of the combined treatment, it is not possible to \ndetermine whether this observation is due to Apealea or to other factors, and delayed reactions related \nto paclitaxel cannot be excluded. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAlopecia was observed in 45% of patients and was abrupt in onset. Pronounced hair loss of ≥ 50% is \nexpected for the majority of patients who experience alopecia. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nArthralgia occurred in 19% of patients and myalgia in 10%. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia and fatigue were very common and occurred in 23% and 11% of patients, respectively. \nInfusion site reactions, such as pain, phlebitis, and erythema, were seen in 12% of patients (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThere were more reports of infusion site pain in the group receiving paclitaxel micellar as compared to \nthe group treated with solvent-based paclitaxel (8% and 1%, respectively). \n \nAdditional experience from clinical studies \n \nApealea has been given as monotherapy in a total of 132 patients at doses ranging between 90 mg/m2 \nin a 3-week regimen to weekly doses of 250 mg/m2 for various indications. Based on the combined \ndata from monotherapy studies, very common adverse reactions and those of special interest were the \nfollowing: neutropenia (45%), fatigue (37%), leukopenia (33%), alopecia (30%), nausea (27%), \ninfusion site reactiona (23%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (20%), diarrhoea (17%), asthenia (15%), \npyrexia (12%), constipation (12%), arthralgia (12%), paraesthesia (11%), pain (11%), vomiting (9%), \nmyalgia (9%), peripheral motor neuropathy (5%), neuropathy (5%), neuropathy peripheral (5%), \nthrombocytopenia (4%), febrile neutropenia (2%), sepsis (2%), tachycardia (2%), phlebitis (2%), \nthrombosis (2%). \n \na Includes the following preferred terms: infusion site phlebitis, infusion site pain, injection site \nreaction, injection site inflammation, infusion site erythema, injection site extravasation, infusion site \nreaction, injection site oedema. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be \nclosely monitored. Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, which are nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, myelosuppression, peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, taxanes, ATC code: L01CD01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPaclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers \nand stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. Stabilisation results in the inhibition of \nthe normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and \n\n\n\n12 \n\nmitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces microtubule bundle formation throughout the \ncell cycle and induces microtubule aster formation during mitosis. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAn open, randomised, multicentre study was conducted in 789 women with recurrent epithelial \novarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer to compare Apealea (paclitaxel \nmicellar) in combination with carboplatin with solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with \ncarboplatin. Patients were treated every three weeks for six cycles, either with Apealea 250 mg/m2 \ngiven as a 1-hour intravenous infusion (N = 391) or with solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 given as \na 3-hour infusion (N = 391). The paclitaxel infusion was followed by carboplatin after an interval of \n30 minutes in both treatment arms.  \n \nPatients were stratified based on relapse (first or second) and CA125 values. The proportions of \npatients treated at first or second relapse were then equal in both treatment groups (76% were treated \nat first relapse and 24% at second relapse). Patients who had pre-existing neuropathy of grade ≥ 2 or \nserious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems were not allowed to enter the \nstudy. The mean age was 56 years of age in both treatment groups (range 26–81). Most of the patients \nenrolled in the study had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (≥ 96%), in similar proportions between \nthe treatment arms. Only a few patients had ECOG performance status of 2.  \n \nIn the clinical study, the proportion of patients receiving six treatment cycles was 81% in the group \ntreated with paclitaxel micellar and 87% in the group receiving solvent-based paclitaxel. The \ncorresponding median number of cycles (min;max) for the two groups were 6 (1;12) and 6 (1;9), \nrespectively. \n \nPatients received premedication prior to infusion of solvent-based paclitaxel, paclitaxel micellar and \ncarboplatin as summarised in Table 3 below. Premedication was not mandated prior to infusion of \npaclitaxel micellar. \n \nTable 3.

The median number \nof cycles with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment for patients receiving GCSF was 6 in both groups. The \nmedian number of cycles with administration of GCSF was 3 (1;6) and the mean value 3.1, each in \nboth groups. \n \nThe principle measures of efficacy were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). \nPFS as the primary endpoint was evaluated by blinded assessment of computerised tomography \nimages using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.0. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThere was no statistically significant difference in PFS or OS between the two treatment arms. A \nnon-inferiority analysis was conducted for PFS in the per-protocol (PP) population with pre-specified \nnon-inferiority margin. The non-inferiority criterion was met for PFS with the upper bound limit of the \none-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the associated hazard ratio being less than 1.2. The \nnon-inferiority criterion was met for OS in the PP population with the upper bound limit of the \none-sided 97.5% CI for the associated hazard ratio being less than 1.185 (Table 4; Figures 1 and 2). In \nthe intention-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 789), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.85 (95% CI: \n0.72;1.00) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.85;1.22), respectively. Thereby, non-inferiority was shown in the ITT \npopulation for PFS, but not for OS. At the time of analysis of the OS data, death had occurred in 56% \nof the patients in the group treated with paclitaxel micellar compared to 60% in the group treated with \nsolvent-based paclitaxel (ITT population). \n \nTable 4.

The hazard \nratios for OS in patients with first and second relapse were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.79;1.21) and 1.18 \n(95% CI: 0.79;1.75), respectively. Thus, the results in the subgroup of patients with first relapse are \nconsistent with the results in the overall population and in addition, there was an indication of PFS \nbenefit for Apealea. \n \nFor safety data comparing the results of combination treatment with Apealea (paclitaxel \nmicellar)/carboplatin and solvent-based paclitaxel/carboplatin, see section 4.8. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nApealea in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma (excluding \nrhabdomyosarcoma and germ cell tumours), peritoneal carcinoma (excluding blastomas and sarcomas) \nand fallopian tube carcinoma (excluding rhabdomyosarcoma and germ cell tumours) (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nWhen Apealea (paclitaxel micellar) is administered intravenously, its pharmacokinetic profile suggests \nthat the formulation immediately releases paclitaxel into the blood. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel \nwere studied in 22 patients with solid tumours after 1-hour infusions of Apealea (dose levels of 90 to \n275 mg/m2). In addition, a study with a crossover design compared total and unbound paclitaxel \nconcentrations in plasma after a 1-hour infusion of Apealea 260 mg/m2 with those after a 1-hour \ninfusion of albumin-bound paclitaxel at the same dose. Total plasma levels of paclitaxel were similar \nafter infusion of the two formulations. The plasma levels of unbound paclitaxel, i.e. the concentration \nthat represents pharmacologically active paclitaxel in the body, were demonstrated to be bioequivalent \n(Cmax and AUC) after administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel and Apealea. Based on limited data, \nCmax and AUC increased with dose after 1-hour infusions of Apealea in doses ranging from 150 to \n275 mg/m2. Dose-linearity could not be ascertained since a large inter-individual variability was \nobserved. \n \nDistribution \n \nPaclitaxel is distributed equally between plasma and blood as described in published in vitro data. The \nmean unbound fraction of paclitaxel (fu) varied between 5.2% and 4.3% over time after Apealea \n\n\n\n16 \n\ninfusion. This was in agreement with the mean fu after albumin-bound paclitaxel infusion which \nvaried between 5.5% and 4.5% over time. \n \nBinding of paclitaxel to both albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein has been reported, but other binding \nproteins such as lipoproteins might be important. There are no reports of active substances able to \ndisplace protein-bound paclitaxel, nor is paclitaxel a likely candidate as a displacer of other active \nsubstances given its low molar concentrations in plasma. Based on the published literature, in vitro \nstudies indicate that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine does \nnot affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel has been shown in vitro to be a substrate for the \ninflux transporter proteins OATP1B3 and OATP1A2. \n \nDuring and after infusion of Apealea, paclitaxel rapidly leaves the plasma compartment with a \ndistribution half-life of about 0.6 hours. Thus, the distribution phase is essentially complete at 2 hours \nafter the end of infusion. The tissue distribution is extensive, with a volume of distribution on the \nterminal elimination phase of about 155 L/m2 corresponding to about 280 L for an average patient \nwith a body surface area of 1.8 m2. Thus, only about 1% of the paclitaxel in the body is located in \nplasma during the elimination phase. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nThe terminal half-life of paclitaxel after Apealea infusion varied about 5-fold between the subjects,  \n5–23 hours. Likewise, total plasma clearance varied about 5-fold from 8 to 41 L/hour. The high \ninterindividual variability in clearance is believed to be a consequence of variability in hepatic enzyme \nactivity. \n \nThe biotransformation and elimination of paclitaxel have been reported in published studies; paclitaxel \nis mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. The main metabolite of paclitaxel is \n6α-hydroxypaclitaxel. Other metabolites are 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α,3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel. \nThe formation of these metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. No pharmacologically \nactive metabolite has been found. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that paclitaxel is a \nsubstrate for the efflux protein P-glycoprotein. The major route of excretion of paclitaxel-derived \nmaterial in humans is the faeces, where 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel constitutes the main material. Renal \nexcretion accounts for a minor part, less than 15% of the dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment have been undertaken with Apealea (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). A population pharmacokinetics study with albumin-bound paclitaxel \ndemonstrated that patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 × ULN) have an \nelimination rate in the normal range. In contrast, patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total \nbilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 3 × ULN) and severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 to ≤ 5 × ULN) had a \n22% or a 26% reduction in paclitaxel elimination rate, respectively. Compared to patients with normal \nhepatic function, hepatically impaired patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN have an increase in \nmean paclitaxel AUC of approximately 20%. Hepatic impairment has no effect on mean paclitaxel \nCmax. Pharmacokinetic data for patients with total bilirubin > 5 × ULN are not available. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinical studies in patients with renal impairment have been undertaken with Apealea (see \nsection 4.2 for dose recommendations). Since renal elimination is a minor pathway for paclitaxel, \nincreased plasma levels are not expected in this patient group. A population pharmacokinetics study \nwith albumin-bound paclitaxel demonstrated that patients with mild and moderate renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min) have an elimination rate similar to that of patients with \nnormal renal function. Information is lacking for patients with severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 mL/min). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nEffects of age, gender, race and body size \nNo analysis of the effect of age, gender or body size on the elimination of Apealea has been \nundertaken. However, a population pharmacokinetics study of 168 patients (86 males and 82 females) \ntreated with solvent-based paclitaxel has been reported. On average, the paclitaxel elimination rate \nwas 20% higher in males compared to in females. With regard to age, the population model indicated \nan approximate 5% decline in paclitaxel elimination rate for each 10-year increase in age compared to \nthe median age of 56 years of the study. This amounted to a 14% decline in an 86-year-old patient \ncompared to one aged 56. Further it has been shown that the rate of paclitaxel elimination increased \nwith increasing body size. The model indicated that a 0.2 m2 increase in BSA would lead to a 9% \nincrease in the elimination rate. There is very little information available on whether the elimination of \npaclitaxel differs between races. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMutagenesis, carcinogenesis, impairment of fertility \n \nIn vitro studies using different cell systems have shown paclitaxel to be clastogenic inducing \nchromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and DNA damage. Chromosomal aberrations have also been \ndetected in in vivo studies in mice and monkeys. Paclitaxel was devoid of mutagenic activity in the \nAmes test or the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase \n(CHO/HGPRT) gene mutation assay. The carcinogenic activity of paclitaxel has not been studied. \nHowever, paclitaxel is potentially carcinogenic based on its mechanism of action and demonstrated \ngenotoxic activity. Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low \nfertility and foetal toxicity in rats. Repeat dose toxicity studies have shown non-reversible, toxic \neffects on male reproductive organs. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nN-(all-trans-retinoyl)-L-cysteic acid methyl ester sodium salt \nN-(13-cis-retinoyl)-L-cysteic acid methyl ester sodium salt \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n \n3 years. \n \nAfter reconstitution \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C in lactated \nand acetated Ringer’s solution and for 4 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution when protected from light. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of \nopening and reconstituting precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used \nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the \nuser. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C). \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nClear type I glass vial with a silicon coated butyl rubber stopper, an aluminium overseal and a plastic \nflip-off cap containing powder equivalent to 60 mg of paclitaxel. \n \nPack size: 1 vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nAdministration precautions \n \nPaclitaxel is an antineoplastic medicinal product and as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised in handling Apealea. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is \nrecommended. If the solution contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed \nthoroughly with water. Apealea should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately \ntrained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant and breast-feeding staff should not handle \nApealea. The reconstituted product should not be diluted. \n \nReconstitution of the medicinal product \n \nApealea is supplied as a sterile powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, the solution \ncontains 1 mg/mL of paclitaxel formulated as micellar nanoparticles. The reconstituted solution for \ninfusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. \n \nProtect from direct and/or bright light throughout the preparation process. The (reconstituted) product \ncan only withstand short-term handling in absence of light protection. \n \nOnly reconstitute Apealea using one of the following commercially available solutions for \nreconstitution: \n\n- sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution suitable for infusion; \n- lactated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion; \n- acetated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion. \n\n \nThe pH of lactated or acetated Ringer’s solution must be in the range of 5.0 to 7.5, and acceptable ion \nconcentrations of calcium and magnesium are listed below (Table 5). \n \nTable 5. Acceptable ion concentrations for calcium and magnesium in lactated and acetated \nRinger’s solutions suitable for reconstitution \n\nIon Range (mmol/L) \nCa2+ 1.0–3.5* \nMg2+ 0.0–2.5* \n\n* Solutions containing both Ca2+ and Mg2+ should have a total (combined) concentration of Ca2+ and \nMg2+ within the range of 1.0 to 3.5 mmol/L. \n \nApealea should be reconstituted using either one of the three suitable solutions for reconstitution and \naccording to the following steps: \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\na. Take the desired number of vials from the refrigerator. The powder should be greenish-yellow \nto yellow. In case of discolouration (orange), discard the vial. To reach room temperature, let \nthe vials stand protected from light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes not above 25 °C. \n\nb. Due to negative pressure in the vial, pressure must be equilibrated by a needle or a spike before \nand during injection of the solution for reconstitution. Using a sterile syringe, inject 60 mL of \nsolution for reconstitution per vial. The solution should be injected during approximately one \nminute towards the inner wall of the vial and not directly onto the powder as this will result in \nfoaming. \n\nc. Swirl the vial in an upright position for approximately 20 seconds. To keep the generation of \nfoam to a minimum, do not shake the vial. \n\nd. Protect from light and allow the vial to stand for three to five minutes. \ne. Swirl the vial again in upright position for approximately 20 seconds, then gently invert it five \n\ntimes. Do not shake.  \nf. Continue to swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved., Alternatively, the vial may \n\nbe placed on a shaker and rotated for up to 20 minutes, while being protected from light (orbital \nshake pattern; 200–250 rpm). Steps c and to f should not be more than 30 minutes. \n\ng. The solution should be clear and greenish-yellow without visible particles or precipitates. If \nparticles, precipitates, discolouration (orange) or opalescence are observed, the solution should \nbe discarded. \n\nh. Inject the required amount of reconstituted Apealea into an empty, sterile ethylene-vinyl acetate \n(EVA) bag. Ensure that the solution is clear and place a light-protective bag over the EVA \ninfusion bag. \n\n \nCompatibility with administration sets made of DEHP-free PVC (i.e. polyvinyl chloride without the \nplasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) has been demonstrated. However, compatibility with \nDEHP-containing administration sets has not been demonstrated. Administration sets containing a \n15 µm polyamide fluid filter should be used. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nApealea 60 mg powder for solution for infusion \npaclitaxel \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Apealea is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Apealea \n3. How Apealea is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Apealea \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Apealea is and what it is used for \n \nApealea is a cancer medicine containing the active substance paclitaxel, which belongs to a group of \nmedicines called taxanes. Paclitaxel affects or stops growth of rapidly dividing cells, such as tumour \ncells. \n \nApealea is used to treat the following cancers in adults, in combination with another medicine called \ncarboplatin: \n• epithelial ovarian cancer – a cancer of the ovary, the organ that produces a woman’s egg cells  \n• primary peritoneal cancer – a cancer of the cells lining the space between the wall of the belly \n\nand the internal organs \n• cancer of the fallopian tubes (the connection between the ovaries and the womb) \nIt is used when other therapies have not worked. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Apealea \n \nDo not use Apealea if you: \n \n• are allergic to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• are breast-feeding \n• have a count of white blood cells called neutrophils below 1.5 × 109/L before start of the therapy \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse, if you are not sure if any of the above applies to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Apealea if you have: \n• reduced liver, kidney or heart function \n\nApealea is not recommended for patients with severely reduced liver or kidney function. \n• previously had nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea during cancer treatment \n\n\n\n31 \n\nContact your doctor immediately, if during treatment you develop: \n• fever, pain, chills, weakness or other signs of infection \n• severe nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea \n• severe reactions at the site of infusion \n• an allergic reaction \n• numbness, tingling, pricking sensation, sensitivity to touch or muscle weakness \nYou may need additional medicines if you develop any of these symptoms. Your doctor may wish to \ndelay further treatment with Apealea or reduce the dose. \n \nAsk your doctor or nurse about hair loss and what can be done to avoid it. \n \nYou will be observed closely during treatment: \n• regular blood tests to ensure it is safe for you to continue treatment \n• symptoms of allergic reaction during the infusion, such as: \n\n− reddening and swelling at the site of infusion \n− low blood pressure \n− breathing difficulties \n− puffing of the face \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nApealea is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years, because it has not been \nstudied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Apealea \n \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Apealea if you are using: \n• ketoconazole, or other medicines to treat fungal infections \n• erythromycin, rifampicin: medicines to treat bacterial infections \n• fluoxetine: a medicine to treat depression \n• gemfibrozil: a medicine to lower blood fats \n• clopidogrel: a medicine that reduces the chances of getting blood clots \n• cimetidine: a medicine to reduce stomach acid \n• efavirenz, nevirapine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir: medicines to treat HIV \n\ninfection \n• carbamazepine, phenytoin: medicines to treat epilepsy and certain pain conditions \n• cisplatin: a medicine to treat cancer \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nTell your doctor before treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are breast-feeding. \n \nApealea is not recommended during pregnancy, as paclitaxel may cause serious birth defects. \nPatients who can become pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment with Apealea \nand for six months afterwards. \n \nStop breast-feeding while being treated, as paclitaxel passes into breast milk and may harm the child. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nApealea may cause side effects such as tiredness or dizziness that may reduce your ability to drive or \nuse machines. Do not drive or use machines if you have these symptoms. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nApealea contains sodium \n \nAfter reconstitution, this medicine contains approximately up to 1.6 g sodium (component of cooking \nsalt) per dose. This is equivalent to 80% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium \nfor an adult. \n \n \n3. How Apealea is given \n \nApealea is given to you by a doctor or nurse by a slow drip (infusion) into a vein. This will take about \none hour. The dose is based on your body surface area (worked out from your height and weight) and \nblood test results. The usual dose is 250 mg/m2 body surface area given every three weeks for up to six \ntreatments. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following: \n• Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n− nerve disorder in arms and legs which causes tingling, numbness or burning pain*  \n• Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n− fever \n− muscle weakness, cramps or spasms \n− allergic reactions, such as breathing difficulties, fainting, swelling of the face, itching, \n\nfeeling hot, chills, particularly during your infusion.

After preparation, each \n\nmillilitre of solution contains 1 mg of paclitaxel (micellar). \n• The other ingredients are: \n\n− N-(all-trans-retinoyl)-L-cysteic acid methyl ester sodium salt \n− N-(13-cis-retinoyl)-L-cysteic acid methyl ester sodium salt \n− sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \n\n See section 2 “Apealea contains sodium”. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWhat Apealea looks like and contents of the pack \n \nApealea is supplied as a greenish-yellow to yellow powder in a glass vial with a rubber stopper and \naluminium seal. \n \nEach carton contains 1 glass vial with powder equivalent to 60 mg of paclitaxel. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nOasmia Pharmaceutical AB \nVallongatan 1 \nSE-752 28 Uppsala \nSweden \nTel +46 18 50 54 40 \ne-mail: med-info@oasmia.com \n \nFor any information about this medicine, please contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nAdministration precautions \nPaclitaxel is an antineoplastic medicinal product and as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised in handling Apealea. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is \nrecommended. If the solution contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed \nthoroughly with water. Apealea should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately \ntrained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant and breast-feeding staff should not handle \nApealea. The reconstituted product should not be diluted. \n \nReconstitution of the medicinal product \nApealea is supplied as a sterile powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, the solution \ncontains 1 mg/mL of paclitaxel formulated as micellar nanoparticles. The reconstituted solution for \ninfusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. \n \nProtect from direct and/or bright light throughout the preparation process. The (reconstituted) product \ncan only withstand short-term handling in absence of light protection. \n \nOnly reconstitute Apealea using one of the following commercially available solutions for \nreconstitution: \n\n- sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution suitable for infusion; \n- lactated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion; \n- acetated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion. \n\n \nThe pH of lactated or acetated Ringer’s solution must be in the range of 5.0 to 7.5 and acceptable ion \nconcentrations of calcium and magnesium are listed below (Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTable 1. Acceptable ion concentrations for calcium and magnesium in lactated and acetated \nRinger’s solutions suitable for reconstitution \n\nIon Range (mmol/L) \nCa2+ 1.0–3.5* \nMg2+ 0.0–2.5* \n\n* Solutions containing both Ca2+ and Mg2+ should have a total (combined) concentration of Ca2+ and \nMg2+ within the range of 1.0 to 3.5 mmol/L. \n \nApealea should be reconstituted using either one of the three suitable solutions for reconstitution and \naccording to the following steps: \n \n1. Take the desired number of vials from the refrigerator. The powder should be greenish-yellow \n\nto yellow. In case of discolouration (orange), discard the vial. To reach room temperature, let \nthe vials stand protected from light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes not above 25 °C. \n\n2. Due to negative pressure in the vial, pressure must be equilibrated by a needle or a spike before \nand during injection of the solution for reconstitution. Using a sterile syringe, inject 60 mL of \nsolution for reconstitution per vial. The solution should be injected during approximately one \nminute towards the inner wall of the vial and not directly onto the powder as this will result in \nfoaming. \n\n3. Swirl the vial in an upright position for approximately for 20 seconds. To keep the generation of \nfoam to a minimum, do not shake the vial. \n\n4. Protect from light and allow the vial to stand for three to five minutes. \n5. Swirl the vial again in upright position for approximately 20 seconds, then gently invert it five \n\ntimes. Do not shake. \n6. Continue to swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved. Alternatively, the vial may \n\nbe placed on a shaker and rotated for up to 20 minutes, while being protected from light (orbital \nshake pattern; 200–250 rpm). Steps 3 to 6 should not be more than 30 minutes. \n\n7. The solution should be clear and greenish-yellow without visible particles or precipitates. If \nparticles, precipitates, discolouration (orange) or opalescence are observed, the solution should \nbe discarded. \n\n8. Inject the required amount of reconstituted Apealea into an empty, sterile ethylene-vinyl acetate \n(EVA) bag. Ensure that the solution is clear and place a light protective-bag over the EVA \ninfusion bag. \n\n \nShelf life after reconstitution \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C in lactated \nand acetated Ringer’s solution and for 4 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution when protected from light. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of \nopening and reconstituting precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used \nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the \nuser. \n \nIntravenous administration  \nCompatibility with administration sets made of DEHP-free PVC (i.e. polyvinyl chloride without the \nplasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) has been demonstrated. However, compatibility with \nDEHP-containing administration sets has not been demonstrated. Administration sets containing a \n15 µm polyamide fluid filter should be used. It is important to flush the infusion set and \ncatheter/cannula before and after the administration using the solution for reconstitution in order to \navoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue and to ensure administration of the \ncomplete dose. \n \nDisposal  \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
