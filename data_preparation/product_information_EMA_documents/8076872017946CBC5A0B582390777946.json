NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 25 mg of methylthioninium chloride. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo contains 3 mg soya lecithin per prolonged-release tablet.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet. \nOff white to light blue, round, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, with approximate dimensions of \n9.5 mm x 5.3 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo is indicated as a diagnostic agent enhancing visualisation of \ncolorectal lesions in adult patients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults including the elderly (≥65 years) \nThe recommended total dose is 200 mg methylthioninium chloride, corresponding to eight 25 mg \ntablets. \n \nThe total dose of the medicinal product must be taken orally during or after the intake of the 4 L \npolyethylene glycol (PEG) based bowel cleansing preparation and should be completed the evening \nprior to the colonoscopy to ensure there is enough time for the tablets to reach the colon and locally \nrelease the methylthioninium chloride prior to the colonoscopy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. The medicinal product should \nbe used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment as there are no data in this \npatient group and methylthioninium chloride is predominantly renally eliminated (see section 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nexperience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in children aged less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo is for oral use.  \n \nTablets should be swallowed whole, without crushing, breaking or chewing. The tablets are coated \nwith a gastro-resistant film that facilitates the delivery of the dye into the colon. Breaking the gastro-\nresistant film by crushing or chewing the tablets may cause early release of the dye in the upper part of \nthe gastrointestinal tract, with a possible loss of the treatment effectiveness. \n \nThe patient should take the medicinal product with the 4 L PEG based bowel cleansing regimen \nchosen by the healthcare provider according to the dosing schedule below: \n \n\n• The first dose of 3 tablets should be taken after drinking at least 1 L of the bowel cleansing \npreparation; \n\n• The second dose of 3 tablets should be taken 1 hour after the first dose; \n• The last dose of 2 tablets should be taken 1 hour after the second dose. \n\n \nTablets should be taken orally with the bowel cleansing preparation chosen by the healthcare provider \nor with equivalent water volumes and the proposed dosing schedule is compatible with either full dose \nor split dose bowel preparations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance, peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1; \n\n• Patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; \n• Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSerotonin syndrome \n \nSerotonin syndrome has been reported with the use of methylthioninium chloride when administered \nvia the intravenous route in combination with serotonergic medicinal products. It is not known if there \nis a risk of serotonin syndrome when methylthioninium chloride is administered orally in preparation \nfor colonoscopy. Patients treated with methylthioninium chloride in combination with serotonergic \nmedicinal products should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms of \nserotonin syndrome occur, discontinue use of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, and initiate \nsupportive treatment (see section 4.5) \n \nPhotosensitivity \n \nMethylthioninium chloride may cause a cutaneous photosensitivity reaction when exposed to strong \nlight sources, such as phototherapy, those found in operating theatres or locally from illuminating \ndevices such as pulse oximeters. \nAdvise patients to take protective measures against exposure to light, because photosensitivity may \noccur after administration of methylthioninium chloride. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nGeneral colouration \n \nMethylthioninium chloride imparts a blue-green colour to urine, faeces and a blue colour to skin which \nmay hinder a diagnosis of cyanosis. \n \nInterference with in vivo monitoring devices \n \nInaccurate pulse oximeter readings \nThe presence of methylthioninium chloride in the blood may result in an underestimation of the \noxygen saturation reading by pulse oximetry. If a measure of oxygen saturation is required after \nadministration of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, it is advisable to check oxygen saturation by CO-\noximetry when available.  \n \nBispectral index monitor \nA fall in the bispectral index (BIS) has been reported following administration of methylthioninium \nchloride class products. If Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is administered during surgery, \nalternative methods for assessing the depth of anaesthesia should be employed. \n \nExcipient warning  \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo contains soya lecithin. If a patient is allergic to peanut or soya, this \nmedicinal product  must not be used (see section 4.3). \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe following medicinal product interactions have been reported for medicinal products containing \nmethylthioninium chloride. \n \nSerotonergic medicinal products \n \nSerious central nervous system (CNS) reactions have been recorded when methylthioninium chloride \nwas administered via intravenous route to patients taking certain psychiatric medicinal products (see \nsection 4.4). Reported cases occurred in patients taking specific serotonergic psychiatric medicinal \nproducts, namely a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake \ninhibitor (SNRI), monoaminooxidase inhibitors or clomipramine. It is not known if there is a risk of \nserotonin syndrome when methylthioninium chloride is administered orally in preparation for \ncolonoscopy.  \nIn clinical studies maximal systemic exposure to methylthioninium chloride (maximum plasma \nconcentration [Cmax]) was lower for orally administered methylthioninium chloride than for \nintravenous administered methylthioninium chloride, suggesting a lower risk of systemic effects such \nas serotonin syndrome occurring with oral methylthioninium chloride than for intravenous \nadministered methylthioninium chloride.  \n \nAgents metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes \n \nThere is limited clinical information regarding the concomitant use of methylthioninium chloride with \nmedicinal products that are metabolised by CYP isoenzymes. In vitro studies indicated that \nmethylthioninium chloride inhibits a range of CYP isozymes in vitro, including 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, \n2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5. These interactions could have a clinical relevance with narrow therapeutic \nindex medicinal products that are metabolised by one of these enzymes (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin, \nalfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and \ntacrolimus).  \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo may be coadministered with anaesthetics / analgesics and/or \nsedative / anxiolytic medicinal products, often used during colonoscopy which are cleared through \nhepatic CYPs reactions such as: midazolam, propofol, diazepam, diphenhydramine, promethazine, \n\n\n\n5 \n\nmeperidine, and fentanyl. The clinical consequences of changes in plasma concentrations of co-\nadministered medicinal products which are substrates of these metabolic enzymes and transporters are \nnot known but cannot be excluded.  \n \nMethylthioninium chloride induces CYP isozymes 1A2 and 2B6 in human hepatocytes culture, \nwhereas it does not induce 3A4 at nominal concentrations up to 40 μM. However, these interactions \nare not expected to have any clinical relevance for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo single dose \napplication. \n \nTransporter interactions \n \nThere is limited clinical information regarding the concomitant use of Methylthioninium chloride \nCosmo with medicinal products that are inhibitors of P-gp and OAT3. Based on in vitro studies, \nmethylthioninium chloride was found to be a possible substrate of the membrane transport proteins \nP-gp, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K and OAT3 and medicinal products which are inhibitors of these \ntransporters have the potential to decrease excretion efficiency of methylthioninium chloride. \nMethylthioninium chloride is known to be a potent inhibitor of the transporters OCT2, MATE1 and \nMATE2-K. The clinical consequences of the inhibition are not known. The administration of \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo has the potential to transiently increase the exposure of medicinal \nproducts primarily cleared by renal transport involving the OCT2/MATE pathway, including \ncimetidine, metformin and acyclovir. However, the clinical impact of these in vitro interactions is \nexpected to be minimal due to the short period of administration of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo \n(approximately 3 hours). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of methylthioninium chloride in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the \npotential reproductive toxicity, the evidence that methylthioninium chloride may pass the placenta, \nand the option to conduct a colonoscopy without supportive use of a visualisation agent, \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of \nchildbearing potential must use effective contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of methythioninium chloride / metabolites in human \nmilk. Studies in animals have shown that there is the potential for excretion of methylthioninium \nchloride / metabolites during breast-feeding (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to and after treatment with Methylthioninium \nchloride Cosmo (see section 4.3).  \n \nBefore administering Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo to a woman who is breast feeding, \nconsideration should be given as to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the \nwoman has ceased breast feeding or whether it is necessary to administer methylthioninium chloride \nas a visualisation agent for her colonoscopy, bearing in mind the theoretical secretion of active \nsubstance and/or metabolite in human milk. If administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding \nshould be interrupted and the expressed feeds discarded. It is usual to advise that breast feeding can be \nrestarted 8 days after the administration of methylthioninium chloride, based upon the \nmethylthioninium chloride half life of 15 ±5 hours. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no information on the impact of methylthioninium chloride on human fertility. Animal and \nin vitro studies with methylthioninium chloride have shown reproductive toxicity. In vitro, \nmethylthioninium chloride has been shown to reduce motility of human sperm in a dose dependent \n\n\n\n6 \n\nmanner. It has also been shown to inhibit the growth of cultured two-cell mouse embryos (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nMethylthioninium class medicinal products have been found to cause symptoms such as migraine, \ndizziness, balance disorder, somnolence, confusion and disturbances in vision. Patients who \nexperience undesirable effects with a potential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely, \nshould refrain from these activities for as long as the undesirable effects persist. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo commonly causes chromaturia (32.4%) and discoloured faeces \n(13.4%), which gradually diminish over the following days. Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is \nassociated with transient nausea and vomiting. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are classified according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nData presented below are based upon clinical studies conducted with Methylthioninium chloride \nCosmo. All adverse reactions recorded at a frequency greater than placebo are reported. Additionally, \nadverse drug reactions of known frequency, reported with methylthioninium chloride administered \nintravenously in the treatment of methaemoglobinaemia are included in the following table. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency \nInfections and infestations Nasopharyngitis Uncommon \nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reactiona Not known \nNervous system disorders Dizzinessb Very common \n\nDysgeusiab Very common \nParaesthesiab Very common \nAnxietyb Common \nHeadacheb Common \nMigraine Uncommon \nSerotonin syndrome (with \nconcomitant use of \nserotonergic medicinal \nproducts,see sections 4.4 and \n4.5) \n\nNot known \n\nVascular disorders Hypotension Uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough Uncommon \nNasal congestion Uncommon \nRhinorrhoea Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Faeces discoloured Very common \nAbdominal pain Common \nVomitingc Common \nNauseac Common \nHaematemesis  Uncommon \nDiarrhoea Uncommon \nAbdominal discomfort  Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nSkin discolouration (blue)b,c Very common \nSweatingb Very common \nEcchymosis  Uncommon \nNight sweats  Uncommon \nPruritus Uncommon \nRash Uncommon \nTelangiectasia Uncommon \nPhotosensitivity Not known \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nPain in extremityb Very common \nFlank pain Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Chromaturia Very common \nPolyuria Uncommon \nDysuria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nChest painb Common \nPain Uncommon \nChills Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nProcedural nausea Uncommon \n\na The inclusion of anaphylactic reactions reported in the table is reflective of sporadic and spontaneous reporting in literature. \nNo event of anaphylactic reaction has been identified during clinical studies of Methylthioninium chloride COSMO. \nb These terms are included as they were reported as very common or common in clinical studies with methylthioninium \nchloride via intravenous administration.  \nc See section below: Description of specific adverse reactions for more detail. \n \nDescription of specific adverse reactions \n \nFrequent adverse reactions \nIn the pooled safety data from the clinical program, the most common related TEAE were chromaturia \nand discoloured faeces, as described above. In addition, skin discolouration has been reported in \nclinical studies with methylthioninium chloride administered via intravenous route, and this may \ninterfere with in vivo monitoring devices (see section 4.4).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nSerotonin syndrome \nSerotonin syndrome has been reported with the use of methylthioninium chloride when administered \nvia the intravenous route in combination with serotonergic medicinal products. Patients treated with \nmethylthioninium chloride in combination with serotonergic medicinal products should be monitored \nfor the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue \ntreatment, and initiate supportive treatment (see section 4.5). \n \nNausea and vomiting \nNausea and vomiting are well recognised adverse reactions associated with the use of PEG-based \nbowel cleansing preparations, however in clinical studies, patients were more likely to experience \nnausea and vomiting when receiving Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in combination with a bowel \npreparation agent, than when receiving the bowel preparation alone.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAvailable information from other methylthioninium chloride class medicinal products administered \nvia intravenous, or other non-oral routes in other indications, show that overdose can result in an \nexacerbation of adverse reactions. Administration of large intravenous doses (cumulative dose \n≥7 mg/kg ) of a methylthioninium chloride caused nausea, vomiting, chest tightness, chest pain, \ndyspnoea, tachypnoea, tachycardia, apprehension, sweating, tremor, mydriasis, blue green staining of \nthe urine, blue staining of the skin and mucous membranes, abdominal pain, dizziness, paraesthesia, \nheadache, confusion, hypertension, mild methaemoglobinaemia (up to 7%) and electrocardiogram \nchanges (T-wave flattening or inversion). These effects lasted 2 to 12 hours following administration. \n \nIn case of overdose of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, the patient should be observed until signs \nand symptoms have resolved, including monitoring for cardiopulmonary, haematologic and neurologic \ntoxicities, and instituting supportive measures as necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia has been observed in infants after administration of 20 mg/kg methylthioninium \nchloride. Death occurred in 2 infants after administration of 20 mg/kg methylthioninium chloride. \nBoth infants had complex medical circumstances and methylthioninium chloride was only partially \nresponsible. \nThe paediatric patient should be maintained under observation, the methaemoglobin level should be \nmonitored and appropriate supportive measures taken as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic agents, other diagnostic agents, ATC code: V04CX  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo is a delayed and extended-release multi-matrix (MMX) formulation \nin the form of tablets, each containing 25 mg of methylthioninium chloride as dried substance. The \ntablets are coated with an enteric coating that is stable at acidic pH (in the stomach) but breaks down \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nat or above pH 7, normally achieved in the terminal ileum. Once the film coating has dissolved, the \nextended-release MMX formulation provides a slow release of the methylthioninium chloride dye, \nresulting in its homogeneous and prolonged dispersion on the surface of the colonic mucosa.  \n \nMethylthioninium chloride is known to be a “vital dye”, meaning “a dye or stain agent capable of \npenetrating living cells or tissues and not inducing immediate evident degenerative changes”. \nMethylthioninium chloride is taken up across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm of actively \nabsorbing cells such as those found in the small intestine and colon, thereby staining the epithelia of \nthose organs. Vital, absorptive dyes such as methylthioninium chloride, enhance the superficial \nstructure of lesions by exploiting the different degrees of active mucosal stain uptake, highlighting \ncontrast and therefore differences between cell types.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nA total of seven clinical studies of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo have been conducted. The \nefficacy of this medicinal product was evaluated in one pivotal Phase 3 study (CB-17-01/06). \n \nStudy CB-17-01/06 was a Phase 3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled, parallel-group study to evaluate the adenoma or carcinoma detection rate in patients \nundergoing safety or surveillance colonoscopy high definition white light (HDWL) colonoscopy after \ncolonic mucosal staining and contrast enhancing with Methylthioninium chloride COSMO tablets \n(compared to placebo tablets and gold standard HDWL colonoscopy alone). All subjects received \n4 litres PEG-based bowel cleansing preparation starting in the late afternoon the day before the \ncolonoscopy. The subjects were prescribed 3, 3, and 2x 25 mg tablets after the second, third, and \nfourth litre of bowel preparation, respectively. The subjects drank at least 250 mL of preparation every \n15 minutes, so that the intake of study medicinal product and bowel cleansing preparation was \ncompleted 4 hours after commencement of the bowel cleansing preparation. The study comprised both \na full dose (200 mg) arm and a low dose (100 mg) arm, which was included to assist blinding of the \nfull dose active arm.  \n \nPrimary endpoint: adenoma detection rate (ADR) \n \nThe primary endpoint of Study CB-17-01/06 was the ADR defined as the proportion of subjects with \nat least one histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma. Histologically proven adenoma was defined \nas Vienna grade 3 to 4.2, or a traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA). \nHistologically proven carcinoma was defined as Vienna grade 4.3 to 5.b. The primary analysis \npopulation was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment \nand underwent colonoscopy, regardless of the completion status. The primary endpoint was analysed \nthrough a logistic regression with treatment, centre, age, gender, reason for colonoscopy, and number \nof excisions included in the regression model as fixed effects. \nPrimary endpoint results are provided in table 1 below. \n \n\nTable 1: Efficacy results from study CB-17-01/06 - primary endpoint: ADR  \n\nAdenoma detection rate (ADR) Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo vs. placebo \nAbsolute value 56.29% vs. 47.81% \nMagnitude of effect 8.48% \n\nAdjusted odds ratio (OR) Point estimate \n95% \n\nConfidence \ninterval limits \n\np-value \n\nOR without logistic regression  1.41 [1.09, 1.81] 0.0099 \nOR with logistic regression 1.46 [1.09, 1.96] 0.0106 \nOR with logistic regression excluding \nexcisions as regression covariate 1.51 [1.15, 1.97] 0.0027 \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSecondary endpoint: false positive rate (FPR) \n \nThe FPR was introduced to control for possible false positive study results, in that a high FPR would \nindicate a higher sampling rate in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group without a concomitant \nincrease in ‘hit rate’ for detecting patients with positive lesions (adenomas or carcinomas). In this \noccurrence, a positive difference between Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo and placebo (i.e., \nincrease in the FPR) was hypothesised and a maximum threshold (non-inferiority margin) was set at \n15%. \nTable 2 and table 3 below present the FPR at both a subject and excision level. Methylthioninium \nchloride Cosmo was statistically not inferior to placebo in FPR at both the subject and excision level. \nFPR at the subject level was numerically lower (-6.44%) in the treatment group than in the placebo \ngroup. At the excision level, the FPR of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was numerically slightly \ngreater (+2.63%) than placebo, however this was not considered clinically significant. These data \ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo at visualising lesions that were \nsubsequently determined to be adenoma and carcinoma. \n \n\nTable 2: Efficacy results from the study CB-17-01/06 - secondary endpoint: FPR (subject level) \n\nFalse positive rate (FPR) (subject level) Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo / placebo \nAbsolute value 23.31% vs. 29.75% \nAdjusted odds ratio (OR) \n\nPoint estimate \n95% \n\nConfidence \ninterval limits \n\np-value \n\nMagnitude of effect = difference in FPR (≥15% \nthreshold for rejecting null hypothesis)  -6.44 [-13.07, 0.19] <0.0001 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Efficacy results from the study CB-17-01/06 - secondary endpoint: FPR (excision level) \n\nFalse positive rate (FPR) (excision level) Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo / placebo \nAbsolute value 49.79% vs. 47.16% \nAdjusted odds ratio (OR) \n\nPoint estimate \n95% \n\nConfidence \ninterval limits \n\np-value \n\nMagnitude of effect = difference in FPR (≥15% \nthreshold for rejecting null hypothesis)  2.63 [-1.55, 6.81] <0.0001 \n\n \nThe tables below present further prespecified and post-hoc clinically meaningful endpoints from the \npivotal Phase III study (CB17-01/06): \n \n\nTable 4: Efficacy results from the study CB-17-01/06 - secondary endpoint: proportion of \nsubjects with at least one adenoma \n\nProportion of subjects with at least one \nadenoma \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo / placebo \n\nAbsolute value 55.88% vs. 47.18% \nAdjusted odds ratio (OR) \n\nPoint estimate \n95% \n\nConfidence \ninterval limits \n\np-value \n\nMagnitude of effect = difference in proportion  8.69 [2.41, 14.98] 0.0082 \nOR without logistic regression  1.42 [1.10, 1.83] 0.0082 \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 5: Efficacy results from the study CB-17-01/06 - exploratory endpoint: proportion of \nsubjects with at least one non-polypoid lesion \n\n \n\nTable 6: Post hoc analysis: proportion of subjects with at least one non-polypoid adenoma or \ncarcinoma \n\n \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nClinical studies show that methylthioninium chloride is well absorbed by the oral route, and rapidly \ntaken up by the tissues. The majority of the dose is excreted in the urine, usually in the form of \nleucomethylthioninium chloride. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing the oral administration of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo at a total dose of 200 mg \n(8 prolonged-release tablets, 25 mg each) in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was \n1.15 ± 0.26 μg/mL, with a median time to peak concentration (Tmax) of 16 hours (10 – 24 hours). \nAbsolute bioavailability was calculated to be approximately 100%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMethylthioninium chloride inhibits a range of CYP isozymes in vitro, including 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, \n2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5, and induces CYP isozymes 1A2 and 2B6, but not 3A4, in human hepatocytes \nculture. In vitro, methylthioninium chloride acts as a substrate and weak inhibitor of P-gp, and as a \nsubstrate of OAT-3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElimination \n \nIn a Phase 1 clinical study with 200 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo cumulative excretion of \nunchanged methylthioninium chloride at 60 hours postdose was approximately 39 ± 16% of the \nadministered dose. The mean terminal half-life (T1/2) was determined to be approximately 15 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIn clinical studies, subgroup analyses based on age and gender did not indicate any difference in safety \nand efficacy. There are limited data in patients ≥ 75 years of age. \n\nProportion of subjects with at least one non-\npolypoid lesion \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo / placebo \n\nAbsolute value 43.92% vs. 35.07% \nAdjusted odds ratio (OR) \n\nPoint estimate \n95% \n\nConfidence \ninterval limits \n\np-value \n\nMagnitude of effect = difference in proportion  8.84% [2.70, 14.99] 0.0056 \nOR without logistic regression  1.45 [1.12, 1.88] 0.0056 \nOR with logistic regression 1.66 [1.21, 2.26] 0.0015 \n\nProportion of subjects with at least one non-\npolypoid adenoma or carcinoma \n\nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo / placebo \n\nAbsolute value 25.77% vs. 19.21% \nAdjusted odds ratio (OR) \n\nPoint estimate \n95% \n\nConfidence \ninterval limits \n\np-value \n\nMagnitude of effect = difference in proportion 6.57% [1.31, 11.82] 0.0167 \nOR without logistic regression 1.46 [1.08, 1.98] 0.0167 \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nElderly \nMethylthioninium chloride Cosmo was investigated in subjects undergoing screening or surveillance \ncolonoscopy, with a mean age of 58.4 years (range 21 to 80 years) and 250 subjects at least 65 years of \nage, thus the subject population was representative of the intended clinical population, however there \nis limited data in patients ≥75 years of age. Overall, the safety profile of this medicinal product was \nbroadly similar regardless of age. It is therefore proposed that neither warnings nor dose adjustments \nare required in respect of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nRetrospective analysis of the safety dataset identifying subjects with some degree of renal impairment \nconcluded that the incidence and pattern of TEAE in subjects receiving Methylthioninium chloride \nCosmo was consistent with the observed pooled safety database, and thus no warnings nor dose \nadjustments are required in respect to mild renal impairment. There are no data in patients with \nmoderate to severe renal impairment, and therefore the medicinal product should be used with caution \nin patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nRetrospective analysis of the safety dataset identifying subjects with some degree of hepatic \nimpairment concluded that the incidence and pattern of TEAE in subjects receiving Methylthioninium \nchloride Cosmo was consistent with the observed pooled safety database, and thus no warnings nor \ndose adjustments are required in respect to mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity \n \nIn repeat dose toxicity studies, with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, no observed adverse effect \nlevel (NOAEL) was considered to be 600 mg/four days. Therefore, effects in non-clinical studies were \nobserved only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure \nindicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nMethylthioninium chloride has been shown to be mutagenic in gene mutation assays in bacteria and \nmouse lymphoma cells, but not in vivo mouse micronucleus assay when administered intravenously at \n62 mg/kg.  \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nSome evidence of carcinogenic activity of methylthioninium chloride in male mice and rats, equivocal \nevidence of carcinogenic activity in female mice and no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female \nrats. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nIn animal studies, methylthioninium chloride produced adverse developmental outcomes in rats and \nrabbits when administered orally during organogenesis. As a precautionary measure, the use of \nmethylthioninium chloride during pregnancy is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nStudies reported in literature suggest that exposure to methylthioninium chloride results in the \nreduction of sperm motility in vitro and teratogenic effects on embryo-foetal developmental effects in \nrats and rabbits. However, there were no consistent effects of methylthioninium chloride \nadministration on reproductive system measures in male or female rats after 3-months oral treatment. \n \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n6.

How to store Methylthioninium chloride COSMO \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Methylthioninium chloride COSMO is and what it is used for \n \nMethylthioninium chloride COSMO contains methylthioninium chloride (also known as methylene \nblue). This medicine is a blue dye.  \n \nThis medicineis used in adults to temporarily stain the colon (large bowel) before colonoscopy, in \nwhich a flexible instrument is inserted into the rectum to view inside the bowel. The staining allows \nthe doctor to see the lining of the colon more clearly and improves the detection of abnormalities.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Methylthioninium chloride COSMO \n \nDo not take Methylthioninium chloride COSMO \n• if you are allergic to methylthioninium chloride, peanut or soya, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6);  \n• if you have been told you have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; \n• if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, or are breastfeeding as your doctor may \n\ndecide that you do not need to take this medicine before your procedure.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine: \n• If you are taking certain antidepressant medicine or a medicine for psychiatric illness. Such as: \n\n- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants such as fluoxetine, \nfluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram and zimeldine; \n\n- bupropion, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, clomipramine, buspirone; \n- medicines classified as monamine oxidase inhibitors (often used for treating depression). \n\nGiving methylthioninium chloride injection (into a vein) in patients also taking these medicines \nhas sometimes resulted in a life-threatening complication called serotonin syndrome. It is not \nknown if serotonin syndrome can occur when methylthioninium chloride is given as a tablet. \nYour doctor will decide what to do if you are taking an antidepressant or another medicine for a \npsychiatric illness.  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nMethylthioninium chloride COSMO should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of \nage as it is not known if the medicine is safe and effective in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Methylthioninium chloride COSMO \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nOther medicines and Methylthioninium chloride COSMO taken together may affect how they each \nwork or are processed and removed from the body. \n \nIn addition to antidepressants and the other medicines for psychiatric illness mentioned under \n‘Warnings and Precautions’, you should tell your doctor before you take this medicine if you are also \ntaking or have recently been given: \n• Medicines to treat irregular heart beats such as amiodarone, digoxin and quinidine \n• Warfarin, to prevent blood clots  \n• Medicines to treat cancer such as alectinib, everolimus, lapatinib, nilotinib and topotecan  \n• Medicines to prevent organ transplant rejection such as ciclosporin, sirolimus and tacrolimus \n• Medicines to treat HIV infection such as ritonavir and saquinavir \n• Medicines to treat migraine such as dihydroergotamine, ergotamine \n• Medicines used to treat anxiety or insomnia, such as diazepam \n• Sedative medicines such as midazolam and propofol  \n• Antihistamine medicines to treat allergies such as diphenhydramine or promethazine \n• Probenecid to treat gout \n• Phenytoin to treat epilepsy \n• Pimozide to treat psychosis or schizophrenia \n• Medicines to treat severe pain such as alfentanil, fentanyl and pethidine (also known as \n\nmeperidine) \n• Cimetidine to treat stomach ulcers and acid reflux \n• Metformin to treat type 2 diabetes  \n• Aciclovir to treat herpes simplex virus infections (e.g. cold sores, genital warts) and varicella–\n\nzoster virus infections (e.g. chicken pox, shingles) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, do not use \nMethylthioninium chloride COSMO as it is not known whether this medicine can harm your unborn \nbaby. \nIf you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \nYour doctor may decide that you do not need to take this medicine if you require a colonoscopy whilst \nbreast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is unlikely that taking Methylthioninium chloride COSMO will affect your ability to drive or use \nmachines. However if you experience any side effects that could impair your ability to drive or use \nmachines safely, such as migraine, feeling dizzy, or disturbance to your vision, then you should not \ndrive or use machines until you feel better. \n \nMethylthioninium chloride COSMO contains soya lecithin \nIf you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not take this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Methylthioninium chloride COSMO \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nThe medicine is supplied as tablets. These must be swallowed whole because they have a special \ncoating to make sure that they pass through your stomach and only break up in your intestines to \nrelease the methylthioninium chloride that stains the colon blue. You must not crush or chew them. \n \nYou will be given a pack containing 8 tablets (a total of 200 mg methylthioninium chloride). These \nmust all be taken over a period of 2 hours, the night before your colonoscopy. Your doctor will explain \nhow you should take the tablets, which are normally taken together with a bowel cleansing preparation \n(a medicine to clear out your colon).  \n \nTake the tablets as instructed by your doctor.  \n \nTypical instructions are: \n \n1. After drinking at least 1 litre of the bowel cleansing preparation (or water) take the first dose of \n\n3 tablets. \n \n\n2. Wait 1 hour then take the second dose of 3 tablets.  \n \n\n3.
