NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNeoSpect 47 micrograms, kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 47 micrograms depreotide as depreotide trifluoroacetate.  \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n \nTo be reconstituted with sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection (not included in this kit). \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nKit for radiopharmaceutical preparation. White powder for solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \nFor scintigraphic imaging of suspected malignant tumours in the lung after initial detection, in \ncombination with CT scan or chest X-ray, in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe medicinal product is for hospital use or in designated Nuclear Medicine Facilities only, by persons \nexperienced in radioisotope diagnostic imaging. \n \nInstructions for reconstitution, handling and disposal are given in section 12. \nAfter reconstitution with sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection, 99mTc-depreotide is \nformed. \n \n\n99mTc-depreotide is administered intravenously in a single dose. The solution may be diluted with \nsodium chloride 0.9% w/v solution for injection for more convenient injection. SPECT images (Single \nPhoton Emission Computed Tomography) obtained between 2 and 4 hours following 99mTc-depreotide \ninjection are required for optimal image interpretation. \n \nDosage for adults \nThe recommended dosage is approximately 47 micrograms depreotide (one vial) labelled with \n555-740 MBq of technetium-99m. \n \nDosage for elderly (>65 years) \nExperience from clinical trials indicates that no dose adjustment is required. \n \nChildren \n99mTc-depreotide is not recommended for use in patients below the age of 18 as data are not available \nfor this age group. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required. See section 4.4 \n \nRe-administration \n99mTc-depreotide is indicated for single use only. Repeat administration must be avoided. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of hypersensitivity reaction to depreotide, any of the excipients of NeoSpect or sodium \npertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection. Pregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe contents of NeoSpect are intended only for use in the preparation of 99mTc-depreotide solution for \ninjection (see section 12). Unlabelled NeoSpect should not be administered directly to the patient. \n \nAs with all injectable medicinal products, anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions may occur after \nadministration. Familiarity with the practice and technique of resuscitation and treatment of \nanaphylaxis is essential. Appropriate treatment and equipment should be readily available. \n \nCare should be exercised in patients with impaired renal function, due to lower renal excretion and \nprobable increase in exposure to radioactivity. \n \nCare should be exercised in patients with reduced liver function. \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical may be handled only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. \nIts receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses \nof the local competent official organisations.  \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety \nand pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying \nwith the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for pharmaceuticals. \n \n99mTc-depreotide, must be handled with care, and appropriate safety measures should be used to \nminimise radiation exposure to clinical personnel. Care should also be taken to minimise radiation \nexposure to the patient, consistent with proper patient management.  \n \nTo minimise the dose of radiation absorbed by the bladder, adequate hydration should be encouraged \nto permit frequent voiding during the first few hours after injection. \n \nTherapy with octreotide acetate can produce severe hypoglycaemia in patients with insulinomas, and \nother somatostatin analogues are known to impair glucose tolerance. Since depreotide also binds to \nsomatostatin receptors, caution should be exercised when administering this medicinal product to \npatients with insulinomas or diabetes mellitus. \n \nNeoSpect is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because data are not available \nfor this age group. \n \nRe-administration: Clinical data reflecting safety and efficacy of multiple injections are only \navailable in 13 patients. Repeat administration must be avoided. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed, and there are little \navailable data on such interactions. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus.  \n 99mTc-depreotide is therefore contraindicated in pregnancy. (See section 4.3) \nWhen it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of childbearing potential, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\ninformation should always be sought about pregnancy. Any woman who has missed a period should \nbe assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. Alternative techniques, which do not involve \nionising radiation, should be considered. \n \nLactation \nIt is not known whether 99mTc-depreotide is excreted in human milk, 99mTc-depreotide is therefore \ncontraindicated during lactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nMost of the adverse reactions reported were transient and of mild intensity. All were uncommon \n(0.1%-1%) in occurrence. Most frequently reported were headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, dizziness, flushing and fatigue. \n \nFor each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of the likely benefit.  \nThe activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably \nachievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended diagnostic result. \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. For diagnostic nuclear medicine investigations, the current evidence suggests that \nthese adverse events will occur with low frequency because of the low radiation doses incurred.  \nFor most diagnostic investigations using nuclear medicine procedures, the radiation dose delivered \n(effective dose equivalent) is less than 20 mSv. Higher doses might be justified in some clinical \ncircumstances. \n \nObserved changes in the laboratory parameters are: increased WBC count, basophils, eosinophils, \nmonocytes and neutrophils, AST, ALT, LDH, total bilirubin and total protein; lowered RBC count and \ntotal protein. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \nTreatment of an overdose should be directed towards the support of vital functions. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for use in tumour detection \nATC code: V09I A05 \n \nTechnetium (99mTc) depreotide solution for injection is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical based upon a \nsynthetic peptide that binds to somatostatin receptors. In vitro data and studies in laboratory animals \nindicate that 99mTc-depreotide binds with high affinity to somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes 2, 3 \nand 5. These receptors are hyper-expressed by malignant tumours. \n \nThe binding affinity of 99mTc-depreotide to SSTR was shown in studies of pancreatic tumours in Lewis \nrats and in vitro in human tumour membranes. The data indicate that the 99mTc-depreotide displays \nhigh-affinity binding to somatostatin receptors. The peptide itself has a lower affinity for these \nreceptors. In a clinical study examining the pharmacodynamic effects of the recommended dose of the \npeptide in human volunteers during an oral GTT (Glucose Tolerance Test), no effects were observed \nother than the normal physiologic response to oral glucose challenge. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nIn the pivotal studies, the negative predictive value for NeoSpect in association with CT for solitary \npulmonary nodules (SPNs) was 90–96% at a disease prevalence of 30-50%. In the same prevalence \nrange the positive predictive value was in the range 52-72%. The corresponding negative predictive \nvalue and positive predictive value for NeoSpect in association with chest X-ray were 96-98% and 61-\n78% respectively. \n \nIn a recent clinical study with a prevalence of malignancy of 49%, the positive predictive value for \nNeoSpect in association with CT/chest X-ray was 84% (CI 63.1-94.7%) for all SPNs and 81.8% for \nlesions equal to or less than 3cm. The negative predictive value was 87.5% (CI 66.5-96.7%) for all \nlesions and 87.5% for lesions equal to or less than 3cm. However, histology was predominantly \nobtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) with 5 out of 49 patients having open thoracotomies. In view \nof the false negative rate of FNA (5-8% false negative rate reported), thoracotomy is considered to be \nthe gold standard. Patients with a negative FNA should be followed up clinically as some FNA \nbiopsies may give false negative results. \n \nThe radiation dose from 18FDG-PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose – Positron Emission Tomography) is lower \nthan that from NeoSpect, whilst still achieving high sensitivity and specificity. However PET is not \nwidely available throughout Europe. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nStudies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated that the tracer confers three-compartment \npharmacokinetic characteristics with a distribution half-life of less than 5 minutes and a terminal half-\nlife of about 20 hours, and a steady-state volume of distribution of 1.5 to 3 l/kg. Total clearance \naveraged 2 to 4 ml/min/kg. Renal clearance averaged about 0.3 ml/min/kg. External whole-body \ngamma scintigraphy showed highest location of radioactivity in the abdomen. One to 18% of the \ninjected dose of radioactivity appeared in the urine at 4 hours after injection. \n \nPlasma radioactivity is predominantly (>90%) in parent form, i.e. as 99mTc-depreotide. The majority of \nthe radioactivity excreted in urine is in parent form. \n \n99mTc-depreotide binds to the extent of about 12% to plasma proteins in patients and healthy \nvolunteers. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n99mTc-depreotide was not mutagenic in vitro in the Ames test or mouse lymphoma test, and it was not \nclastogenic in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test. Toxic effects observed in the animal studies were \nnot considered to be relevant in clinical use in humans. Studies have not been conducted to evaluate \ncarcinogenic potential or effects on fertility. \n6.

DOSIMETRY \n \nTechnetium-99m disintegrates by isomeric transition with the emission of gamma radiation with an \nenergy of 140 keV and a half life of 6 hours to technetium-99, which can be regarded as quasi stable. \n \nFor this product, the effective dose resulting from an administered activity of 555-740 MBq is \ntypically 8.88–11.84 mSv for a 70 kg individual. \n \nBased on human data, the absorbed radiation doses by individual organs of an average human adult \n(70 kg) from an intravenous injection of the agent are listed below. The values are listed in descending \norder as mGy/MBq and assume urinary bladder emptying at 4.8 hours. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n7 \n\nEstimated absorbed radiation dose \n \nTarget Organ mGy/MBq \nKidneys 0.090 \nSpleen 0.042 \nTestes 0.031 \nThyroid gland 0.024 \nBone marrow 0.021 \nLiver 0.021 \nBone surface 0.015 \nHeart wall 0.014 \nLungs 0.014 \nAdrenal glands 0.012 \nPancreas 0.010 \nUrinary bladder 0.0089 \nUterus 0.0084 \nSmall intestine 0.0050 \nUpper large intestine 0.0050 \nOvaries 0.0042 \nLower large intestine 0.0038 \n \n\nDose calculations were performed using the standard MIRD method (MIRD Pamphlet No. 1 rev., Soc. \nNucl.

Sodium \npertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection (Ph.Eur) is used for reconstitution. \n \nInstructions for the preparation of 99mTc-depreotide: \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceutical creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spills of urine, vomiting etc. Local regulations for radioactive materials must be \napplied in the radiation protection precautions and waste disposal. \n \nUse aseptic technique throughout. The user should wear waterproof gloves and use shielding at all \ntimes when handling the reconstituted vial or syringes containing the radioactive agent. \n \nThe activity of 99mTc-depreotide administered to the patient should be measured using a suitably \ncalibrated dose calibrator immediately prior to administration to the patient. \n \n1. Prepare a boiling water bath containing a lead vial shield standing in and equilibrated with the \n\nboiling water bath. \n2. Allow the vial kit to warm to 15 °C - 30 °C and place it in a suitable shielding container and \n\nsanitise the rubber septum with sanitising alcohol swab. \n3. Using a shielded syringe, inject the required radioactivity of up to 1.8 GBq of sodium \n\npertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection, (diluted as appropriate with sodium chloride 0.9% \nw/v solution for injection to a total of 1 ml) into the shielded vial. See Cautionary notes 1 and 2 \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n8 \n\nbelow. \n Before removing the syringe from the vial, withdraw a volume of gas from above the solution \n\nequal to the volume of pertechnetate added in order to normalise the pressure inside the vial. \nSwirl gently for 10 seconds in order to ensure complete dissolution of the powder. \n\n4. Immediately transfer the reaction vial to a lead safe in the boiling water bath, maintaining the \nvial in the upright position. Incubate for 10 minutes in this condition. Allow the vial to cool to \nbody temperature (about 15 minutes) at room temperature before proceeding. The vial should \nnot be cooled under running water, as this may impede labelling. \n\n5. Assay the total radioactivity, complete the user radiation label and attach it to the lead shielded \nvial. \n\n6. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit: visually inspect \nthe reconstituted solution at a safe distance through leaded glass. Do not use if the solution is \nnot clear or if it contains visible particulate matter. \n\n7. Store the reconstituted solution for injection upright at 15 °C – 25 °C and use within 5 hours of \npreparation. \n\n \nCautionary notes \n \n1. The volume of diluted sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection, added to the vial \n\nmust be 1 ml. \n2. The radioactive amount of the diluted generator eluate must not exceed 1.8 GBq when it is \n\nadded to the vial. The amount of radioactivity is calculated according to the planned time of \ninjection to the patient, to obtain a single patient dose of 555 – 740 MBq from the entire \nreconstituted vial. \n\n3. Safety and effectiveness of 99mTc-depreotide were established using investigational material \nshown to have a radiochemical purity of at least 90% by ITLC prior to administration to patients \nin clinical studies. \n\n4. The contents of the NeoSpect vial are not radioactive; however, after the addition of sodium \npertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be \nmaintained. \n\n5. The labelling reaction involved in the preparation of 99mTc-depreotide depends upon \nmaintaining tin in the divalent (reduced) state. Any oxidant present in the sodium pertechnetate \n(99mTc) solution for injection might adversely affect the quality of the preparation. Sodium \npertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection containing oxidants ought not to be used for the \npreparation of the labelled product. \n\n6. Sodium chloride 0.9% w/v solution for injection must be used as the diluent. Do not use \nbacteriostatic sodium chloride solution for injection as a diluent for pertechnetate, because it \nmight adversely affect the radiochemical purity and, hence, the biological distribution of the \ntracer. \n\n7. The contents of the NeoSpect vial are sterile. The vial contains no bacteriostatic preservative. It \nis essential that the user follows the directions carefully and adheres to aseptic procedures \nduring the preparation of the radiopharmaceutical. \n\n \nQuality control \n \nAn assay of the radiochemical purity of the prepared injection can be performed using the following \nchromatographic procedures. \n \nEquipment and Materials \n1. Two Gelman ITLC-SG strips (2 cm x 10 cm) \n2. Two developing tanks and covers \n3. Saturated sodium chloride solution (SSCS)1 (1 See section 1.) below) \n4. 1:1 (v/v) methanol / 1M ammonium acetate (MAM)2 (2 See section 2.) below) \n5. One 1 ml syringe and 21-gauge needle \n6. Suitable counting equipment \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\n1) Saturated sodium chloride solution (SSCS) \n May be prepared by adding about five grams of sodium chloride to the bottom of one \n\nchromatography chamber; add approximately 10 millilitres of distilled water to the solid sodium \nchloride and shake periodically during 10 to 15 minutes. Solid sodium chloride should remain at \nthe bottom of the jar; if there is no residue, add more solid sodium chloride and shake again for \n10 to 15 minutes. Continue until a solid residue remains. (The saturated sodium chloride solution \ncan be reused. Add more distilled water or sodium chloride as needed for subsequent use always \nmaintaining some undissolved sodium chloride at the bottom of the chamber.) \n \n\n2) 1:1 Methanol / 1M Ammonium Acetate (MAM) \n 1M Ammonium Acetate - Add 3.9 ± 0.1 grams of solid ammonium acetate to a 50 ml volumetric \n\nflask. Add approximately 15 ml of distilled water to the flask, stopper, and swirl to dissolve the \nsolid. Add distilled water up to the 50 ml mark, mix thoroughly. The ammonium acetate solution \ncan be used for up to one month. Label the solution with a one month expiration date. \n\n 1:1 Methanol / 1M Ammonium Acetate (MAM) - Carefully mix one part methanol with one part \n1M Ammonium Acetate. The MAM should be prepared fresh daily. \n\n \nMETHOD \n \n1. Pour the MAM and SSCS into separate developing tanks to a depth of approximately 0.5 cm. \n\nCover the tanks and allow to equilibrate with the solvent vapours. \n2. Mark two Gelman ITLC-SG strips with a light pencil at 1 cm from the bottoms of each. \n3. Spot one drop (approximately 5-10 microlitres) of 99mTc-depreotide at the origin of each strip \n\nusing the hypodermic needle. Do not allow the spots to dry. \n CAUTION: Do not allow the needle to touch the strip. \n4. Place the developing tanks behind a lead shield. \n5. Place one ITLC-SG strip in the MAM developing solvent. Place the second ITLC-SG strip in \n\nthe SSCS developing solvent. Place the strips upright in the respective developing solvent such \nthat the spot is above the solvent line and the top of each strip leans against the side of the tank. \nCAUTION: Do not allow the sides of the strip to contact the side of the tank. Cap the \ndeveloping tanks. \n\n6. Allow the solvent front to move to the top of the strip. \n7. Remove the strip from the tank and allow the strip to dry behind a lead shield. \n8. Cut the strips as described below: \n ITLC-SG MAM: cut the strip at Rf 0.40 (40% of the distance from the origin to the solvent \n\nfront). \n ITLC-SG SSCS: cut the strip at Rf 0.75 (75% of the distance from the origin to the solvent \n\nfront) \n9. Count each strip section in a dose calibrator and interpret the results as follows: \n\n \nPercent technetium-99m non-mobile material = A \n \n Radioactivity in bottom piece of ITLC-SG MAM strip (Rf 0-0.40) \nA = 100 x  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n Total radioactivity in both pieces of ITLC-SG MAM strip \n \nPercent technetium (99mTc) pertechnetate, technetium-99m labelled glucoheptonate and \ntechnetium-99m labelled edetate = B \n \n Radioactivity in top piece of ITLC-SG SSCS strip (Rf 0.75-1.0) \nB = 100 x  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n Total radioactivity in both pieces of ITLC-SG SSCS Strip \n \n\n10.

Kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation \nDepreotide \n\n \nPlease read this leaflet carefully. It tells you about your medicine.  \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What NeoSpect is and what it is used for. \n2. Before you use NeoSpect. \n3. How to use NeoSpect. \n4. Possible side effects. \n5. How to store NeoSpect. \n6. Further information. \n \n \n1. WHAT NeoSpect IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  \n \nProduct type \nNeoSpect is a radiopharmaceutical product used for diagnostic purposes. A diagnostic \nradiopharmaceutical is a product which, when injected, temporarily collects in a particular part of the \nbody (for example a tumour). Because the substance contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be \ndetected from outside the body using special cameras, and a picture, known as a scan, can be taken. \nThis scan will show exactly the distribution of the radioactivity within the body. This can give the \ndoctor valuable information such as the location of a tumour. \n \nWhat NeoSpect is used for \nNeoSpect is for diagnostic use only. NeoSpect is used to provide pictures which show the location of \nsuspected malignant cancer tissue (a tumour) in the lung. When injected, the radiolabelled compound \nbinds to malignant cancer tissue. Your doctor will then take a picture (scan) of your lungs using a \nspecial camera. The area where the radioactive compound is collected, will light up on the picture and \ngive information on the location of the tumour. The evaluation also includes examinations by CT-scan \nor chest X-ray. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE NeoSpect \n \nDo not use NeoSpect \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to depreotide or any of the other ingredients of NeoSpect or \n\nto the radioactive technetium. \n- if there is any possibility that you are pregnant. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nTake special care with NeoSpect \n- if you are suffering from diabetes or other related conditions \n- if you have a renal disease \n- if you have a liver disease \n \nIf any of the above mentioned conditions are applicable to you, you should inform your doctor. \n \nNeoSpect is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age, as data are not available for \nthis age group. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n20 \n\nThe use of NeoSpect does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity, however your doctor \nwill always consider the possible risks and benefits when considering the use of this product. \n \nTo minimise the dose of radiation absorbed by the bladder, the intake of fluids should be increased \nduring the first few hours after injection to permit frequent voiding. \n \nTaking other medicines \nThere is only limited data available regarding interactions with other products. \nPlease inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \neven those not prescribed. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou should tell your doctor if there is any possibility that you are pregnant, or if you are breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nHowever, it is not considered likely that NeoSpect will affect your ability to drive or to operate \nmachinery. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE NeoSpect \n \nDosage and administration \n \nNeoSpect is for use in patients over the age of 18 years. \n \nThe recommended dosage is one vial (approximately 47 micrograms of depreotide) labelled with \n555-740 MBq of technetium-99m. \n \nRadiolabelled NeoSpect is administered as a single injection into a vein. After labelling with the \nradioactive sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) solution for injection, radiolabelled NeoSpect will be injected \nbefore the scan is taken. \n \nThe scanning may take place 2-4 hours after injection of NeoSpect. \n \nAny 99mTc-depreotide which remains in your body, will naturally lose its radioactivity within 2-3 days. \n \nBecause there are strict laws covering the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity, NeoSpect will \nalways be used in a hospital or a similar setting. It will only be handled and administered by people \nwho are trained and qualified in the safe handling of radioactive material. \n \nOverdose \nIf overdose is suspected, symptomatic treatment will be administered. Your doctor may recommend \nthat you drink plenty of fluids to speed removal of traces of the radiopharmaceutical from your body. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, NeoSpect can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n21 \n\nMost of the side effects reported were transient and of mild intensity. \nMost frequently reported were: \n \n* headache  * nausea \n* vomiting  * diarrhoea \n* abdominal pain * dizziness \n* flushing * fatigue \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE NeoSpect \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nThe product label includes the appropriate storage conditions and the expiry date for the product. \nDo not use NeoSpect after the expiry date which is stated on the label. \n \nTrained hospital staff will ensure the correct storage of NeoSpect. \n \n \n6. FURTHER INFORMATION \n \nWhat NeoSpect contains \n \n- The active substance is 47 micrograms depreotide as depreotide trifluoroacetate. \n- The other ingredients are sodium glucoheptonate dihydrate, stannous chloride dihydrate, \n\ndisodium edetate and hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. \n \nWhat NeoSpect looks like and contents of the pack \n \nThe product is a kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation. \nNeoSpect is a powder for solution for injection that has to be dissolved and labelled with radioactive \ntechnetium before use. When a solution of the radioactive substance sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) is \nadded to the vial, 99mTc-depreotide is formed. This solution is ready for injection into a vein. \n \nPack sizes \n \n1 vial containing 47 micrograms of depreotide. \n5 vials, each vial containing 47 micrograms of depreotide. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder: \n \nCIS bio international \nB.P. 32 \n91192 GIF sur YVETTE cedex \nFRANCE \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n22 \n\nManufacturer responsible for batch release: \n \nCIS bio international \nB.P. 32 \n91192 GIF sur YVETTE cedex \nFRANCE \n \nThis leaflet was last approved in  \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tMANUFACTURING AUTHORISATION HOLDER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCHRELEASE\n\tCONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tLABELLING\n\tPACKAGE LEAFLET","content_length":34474,"file_size":432176}],"conditional_approval":false,"exceptional_circumstances":false,"indication":"<div> \n <div class=\"ecl-field__body\"> \n  <div class=\"ecl-editor first last\">\n   <p>This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.<br>For scintigraphic imaging of suspected malignant tumours in the lung after initial detection, in<br>combination with CT scan or chest X-ray, in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules.</p>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>","therapeutic_area":"Radionuclide Imaging","contact_address":"Route Nationale 306, Saclay\nB.P. 32\nF-91192 Gif sur Yvette Cedex\nFrance","biosimilar":false}
