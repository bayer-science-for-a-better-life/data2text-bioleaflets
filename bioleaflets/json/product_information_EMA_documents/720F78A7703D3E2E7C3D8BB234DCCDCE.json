NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGliolan 30 mg/ml powder for oral solution. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne bottle contains 1.17 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), corresponding to 1.5 g 5-aminolevulinic \nacid hydrochloride (5-ALA HCl). \n \nOne ml of reconstituted solution contains 23.4 mg of 5-ALA, corresponding to 30 mg 5-ALA HCl. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for oral solution. \nThe powder is a white to off-white cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nGliolan is indicated in adults for visualisation of malignant tissue during surgery for malignant glioma \n(WHO grade III and IV). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product should only be used by experienced neurosurgeons conversant with surgery of \nmalignant gliomas and in-depth knowledge of functional brain anatomy who have completed a \ntraining course in fluorescence-guided surgery. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg 5-ALA HCl per kilogram body weight.  \nThe total number of bottles needed to achieve the intended dose for the individual patient can be \ndetermined according to the equation below (rounded up to the nearest whole bottle): \n \n Patient body weight (kg) \nNumber of bottles =  ——————————————\n\n  75 kg/bottle \n \nThe administration volume needed to achieve the intended dose for the individual patient can be \ncalculated according to the equation below: \n \n Patient body weight (kg) x 20 mg/kg \nAdministration volume (ml) =  ———————————————————\n\n  30 mg/ml \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo trials have been performed in patients with clinically relevant hepatic or renal impairment. \nTherefore, this medicinal product should be used with caution in such patients.  \n \nElderly \nThere are no special instructions for use in elderly patients with regular organ function. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Gliolan in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe solution should be administered orally three hours (range 2-4 hours) before anaesthesia. Use of \n5-ALA under conditions other than the ones used in the clinical trials entail an undetermined risk. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or porphyrins. \n• Acute or chronic types of porphyria. \n• Pregnancy (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n5-ALA-induced fluorescence of brain tissue does not provide information about the tissue’s \nunderlying neurological function. Therefore, resection of fluorescing tissue should be weighed up \ncarefully against the neurological function of fluorescing tissue. \n \nSpecial care must be taken in patients with a tumour in the immediate vicinity of an important \nneurological function and pre-existing focal deficits (e.g. aphasia, vision disturbances and paresis) \nthat do not improve on corticosteroid treatment. Fluorescence-guided resection in these patients has \nbeen found to impose a higher risk of critical neurological deficits. A safe distance to eloquent \ncortical areas and subcortical structures of at least 1 cm should be maintained independent of the \ndegree of fluorescence. \nIn all patients with a tumour in the vicinity of an important neurological function, either pre- or \nintraoperative measures should be used to localise that function relative to the tumour in order to \nmaintain safety distances. \n \nAfter administration of this medicinal product, exposure of eyes and skin to strong light sources (e.g. \noperating illumination, direct sunlight or brightly focused indoor light) should be avoided for \n24 hours. \nCo-administration with other potentially phototoxic substances (e.g. tetracyclines, sulfonamides, \nfluoroquinolones, hypericin extracts) should be avoided (see also section 5.3). \n \nWithin 24 hours after administration, other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products should be \navoided. \n \nIn patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, this medicinal product should be used with \ncaution since literature reports have shown decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulmonary \nartery systolic and diastolic pressure as well as pulmonary vascular resistance. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPatients should not be exposed to any photosensitizing agent up to 2 weeks after administration of \nGliolan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of 5-ALA in pregnant women. Some limited \nanimal studies suggest an embryotoxic activity of 5-ALA plus light exposure (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, Gliolan should not be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether 5-ALA or its metabolite protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is excreted in human milk. \nThe excretion of 5-ALA or PPIX in milk has not been studied in animals. Breast-feeding should be \ninterrupted for 24 hours after treatment with this medicinal product. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data available regarding the influence of 5-ALA on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant, the treatment itself will have an influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAdverse reactions observed after the use of this medicinal product for fluorescence-guided glioma \nresection are divided into the following two categories: \n \n- immediate reactions occurring after oral administration of the medicinal product before \n\nanaesthesia (= active substance-specific side effects) \n- combined effects of 5-ALA, anaesthesia, and tumour resection (= procedure-specific side effects). \n \nMost serious side effects include anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, neurological disorders \nand thromboembolism. Further frequently observed side effects are vomiting, nausea and increase of \nblood bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase and \nblood amylase.  \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSubstance-specific side effects: \nCardiac disorders  Uncommon:  hypotension \nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon:  nausea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon:  photosensitivity reaction, \n\nphotodermatosis \n \nProcedure-related side effects \nThe extent and frequency of procedure-related neurological side effects depends on the localisation of \nthe brain tumour and the degree of resection of tumour tissue lying in eloquent brain areas (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Very common: anaemia, thrombocytopenia, \n\nleukocytosis  \nNervous system disorders Common: neurological disorders (e.g. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nhemiparesis, aphasia, \nconvulsions, hemianopsia) \n\nUncommon:  brain oedema \nVery rare:  hypesthesia \n\nCardiac disorders  Uncommon:  hypotension \nVascular disorders Common:  thromboembolism \nGastrointestinal disorders Common:  vomiting, nausea \n\nVery rare:  diarrhoea \nHepatobiliary disorders Very common: blood bilirubin increased, alanine \n\naminotransferase increased, \naspartate aminotransferase \nincreased, gamma \nglutamyltransferase increased, \nblood amylase increased \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn a single-arm trial including 21 healthy male volunteers, erythema of the skin could be provoked by \ndirect exposure to UVA light up to 24 hours after oral application of 20 mg/kg body weight \n5-ALA HCl. An adverse drug reaction of mild nausea was reported in 1 out of 21 volunteers. \n  \nIn another single-centre trial, 21 patients with malignant glioma received 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg body \nweight 5-ALA HCl followed by fluorescence-guided tumour resection. The only adverse reaction \nreported in this trial was one case of mild sunburn occurring in a patient treated with the highest dose. \n  \nIn a single-arm trial including 36 patients with malignant glioma, adverse drug reactions were \nreported in 4 patients (mild diarrhoea in one patient, moderate hypesthesia in another patient, \nmoderate chills in another patient, and arterial hypotension 30 minutes after application of 5-ALA in \nanother patient). All patients received the medicinal product in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight and \nunderwent fluorescence-guided resection. Follow-up time was 28 days. \n \nIn a comparative, unblinded phase III trial (MC-ALS.3/GLI), 201 patients with malignant gliomas \nreceived 5-ALA HCl in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight and 176 of these patients underwent \nfluorescence-guided resection with subsequent radiotherapy. 173 patients received standard resection \nwithout administration of the medicinal product and subsequent radiotherapy. Follow-up time \ncomprised at least 180 days after administration. At least possibly related adverse reactions were \nreported in 2/201 (1.0 %) patients: mild vomiting 48 hours after surgery, and mild photosensitivity \n48 hours after trial surgery. Another patient accidentally received an overdose of the medicinal \nproduct (3000 mg instead of 1580 mg). Respiratory insufficiency, which was reported in this patient, \nwas managed by adaptation of ventilation and resolved completely. A more pronounced transient \nincrease of liver enzymes without clinical symptoms was observed in the 5-ALA-treated patients. \nPeak values occurred between 7 and 14 days after administration. Increased levels of amylase, total \nbilirubin, and leukocytes, but decreased levels of thrombocytes and erythrocytes were observed, \nhowever differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nWithin a clinical trial, a 63-year old patient with known cardiovascular disease was accidentally given \nan overdose of 5-ALA HCl (3000 mg instead of 1580 mg). During surgery he developed respiratory \ninsufficiency, which was managed by adaptation of ventilation. After surgery the patient also \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 6 \n\ndisplayed facial erythema. It was stated that the patient had been exposed to more light than permitted \nfor the trial. Respiratory insufficiency and erythema completely resolved. \n \nIn the event of overdose, supportive measures should be provided as necessary, including sufficient \nprotection from strong light sources (e.g. direct sunlight). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, sensitisers used in photodynamic therapy, \nATC code: L01XD04 \n \nMechanism of action \n5-ALA is a natural biochemical precursor of heme that is metabolised in a series of enzymatic \nreactions to fluorescent porphyrins, particularly PPIX. 5-ALA synthesis is regulated by an \nintracellular pool of free heme via a negative feedback mechanism. Administration of excess \nexogenous 5-ALA avoids the negative feedback control, and accumulation of PPIX occurs in target \ntissue. In the presence of visible light, fluorescence of PPIX (photodynamic effect) in certain target \ntissues can be used for photodynamic diagnosis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nSystemic administration of 5-ALA results in an overload of the cellular porphyrin metabolism and \naccumulation of PPIX in various epithelia and cancer tissues. Malignant glioma tissue (WHO-grade \nIII and IV, e.g. glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma or anaplastic astrocytoma) has also been \ndemonstrated to synthesise and accumulate porphyrins in response to 5-ALA administration. The \nconcentration of PPIX is significantly lower in white matter than in cortex and tumour. Tissue \nsurrounding the tumour and normal brain may also be affected. However, 5-ALA induced PPIX \nformation is significantly higher in malignant tissue than in normal brain. \n \nIn contrast, in low-grade tumours (WHO-grade I and II, e.g. medulloblastoma, oligodendroglioma) no \nfluorescence could be observed after application of the active substance. Brain metastases revealed \ninconsistent or no fluorescence. \n \nThe phenomenon of PPIX accumulation in WHO grade III and IV malignant gliomas may be \nexplained by higher 5-ALA uptake into the tumour tissue or an altered pattern of expression or \nactivity of enzymes (e.g. ferrochelatase) involved in haemoglobin biosynthesis in tumour cells. \nExplanations for higher 5-ALA uptake include a disrupted blood-brain barrier, increased \nneo-vascularisation, and the overexpression of membrane transporters in glioma tissue. \n \nAfter excitation with blue light (λ=400-410 nm), PPIX is strongly fluorescent (peak at λ=635 nm) and \ncan be visualised after appropriate modifications to a standard neurosurgical microscope. \n \nFluorescence emission can be classified as intense (solid) red fluorescence (corresponds to vital, solid \ntumour tissue) and vague pink fluorescence (corresponds to infiltrating tumour cells), whereas normal \nbrain tissue lacking enhanced PPIX levels reflects the violet-blue light and appears blue. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn a phase I/II trial including 21 patients, a dose-efficacy relationship between the dose levels and the \nextent and quality of fluorescence in the tumour core was detected: higher doses of 5-ALA enhanced \nthe fluorescence quality and the fluorescence extent of the tumour core compared to demarcation of \nthe tumour core under standard white illumination in a monotone, non-falling fashion. The highest \ndose (20 mg/kg body weight) was determined to be the most efficient. \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nA positive predictive value of tissue fluorescence of 84.8 % (90 % CI: 70.7 %-93.8 %) was found. \nThis value was defined as the percentage of patients with positive tumour cell identification in all \nbiopsies taken from areas of weak and strong fluorescence. The positive predictive value of strong \nfluorescence was higher (100.0 %; 90 % CI: 91.1 %-100.0 %) than of weak fluorescence (83.3 %; \n90 % CI: 68.1 %-93.2 %). Results were based on a phase II trial including 33 patients receiving \n5-ALA HCl in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight.  \n \nThe resulting fluorescence was used as an intraoperative marker for malignant glioma tissue with the \naim of improving the surgical resection of these tumours. \n \nIn a phase III trial with 349 patients with suspected malignant glioma amenable to complete resection \nof contrast-enhancing tumour were randomised to fluorescence-guided resection after administration \nof 20 mg/kg body weight 5-ALA HCl or conventional resection under white light. Contrast-enhancing \ntumour was resected in 64 % of patients in the experimental group compared to 38 % in the control-\ngroup (p<0.0001). \nAt the visit six months after tumour resection, 20.5 % of 5-ALA-treated-patients and 11 % of patients \nwho underwent standard surgery were alive at the six-month visit without progression. The difference \nwas statistically significant using the chi-square test (p=0.015). \nNo significant increase in overall survival has been observed in this trial; however, it was not powered \nto detect such a difference. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral characteristics \nThis medicinal product shows good solubility in aqueous solutions. After ingestion, 5-ALA itself is \nnot fluorescent but is taken up by tumour tissue (see section 5.1) and is intracellularily metabolised to \nfluorescent porphyrins, predominantly PPIX. \n \nAbsorption \n5-ALA as drinking solution is rapidly and completely absorbed and peak plasma levels of 5-ALA are \nreached 0.5–2 hours after oral administration of 20 mg/kg body weight. Plasma levels return to \nbaseline values 24 hours after administration of an oral dose of 20 mg/kg body weight. The influence \nof food has not been investigated because this medicinal product is generally given on empty stomach \nprior to induction of anaesthesia.  \n \nDistribution and biotransformation \n5-ALA is preferentially taken up by the liver, kidney, endothelials and skin as well as by malignant \ngliomas (WHO grade III and IV) and metabolised to fluorescent PPIX. Four hours after oral \nadministration of 20 mg/kg body weight 5-ALA HCl, the maximum PPIX plasma level is reached. \nPPIX plasma levels rapidly decline during the subsequent 20 hours and are not detectable anymore \n48 hours after administration. At the recommended oral dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, tumour to \nnormal brain fluorescence ratios are usually high and offer lucid contrast for visual perception of \ntumour tissue under violet-blue light for at least 9 hours. \n \nBesides tumour tissue, faint fluorescence of the choroid plexus was reported. 5-ALA is also taken up \nand metabolised to PPIX by other tissues, e.g. liver, kidneys or skin (see section 4.4). Plasma protein \nbinding of 5-ALA is unknown. \n \nElimination \n5-ALA is eliminated quickly with a terminal half-life of 1-3 hours. Approximately 30 % of an orally \nadministered dose of 20 mg/kg body weight is excreted unchanged in urine within 12 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThere is dose proportionality between AUC0-inf. of 5-ALA values and different oral doses of this \nmedicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetics of 5-ALA in patients with renal or liver impairment has not been investigated.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nStandard safety pharmacology experiments were performed under light protection in the mouse, rat \nand dog. 5-ALA administration does not influence the function of the gastrointestinal and central \nnervous system. A slight increase in saluresis cannot be excluded. \n \nSingle administration of high doses of 5-ALA to mice or rats leads to unspecific findings of \nintolerance without macroscopic abnormalities or signs of delayed toxicity. Repeat-dose toxicity \nstudies performed in rats and dogs demonstrate dose-dependent adverse reactions affecting changes in \nbile duct histology (non-reversible within a 14 day recovery period), transient increase in \ntransaminases, LDH, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, creatinine, urea and vomiting (only in dogs). \nSigns of systemic toxicity (cardiovascular and respiratory parameters) occurred at higher doses in the \nanaesthetised dog: at 45 mg/kg body weight intravenously a slight decrease in peripheral arterial \nblood pressure and systolic left ventricular pressure was recorded. Five minutes after administration, \nthe baseline values had been reached again. The cardiovascular effects seen are considered to be \nrelated to the intravenous route of administration. \n \nPhototoxicity observed after 5-ALA treatment in vitro and in vivo is obviously closely related to dose- \nand time-dependent induction of PPIX synthesis in the irradiated cells or tissues. Destruction of \nsebaceous cells, focal epidermal necrosis with a transient acute inflammation and diffuse reactive \nchanges in the keratinocytes as well as transient secondary oedema and inflammation of dermis are \nobserved. Light exposed skin recovered completely except for a persistent reduction in the number of \nhair follicles. Accordingly, general light protective measures of eyes and skin are recommended for at \nleast 24 hours after administration of this medicinal product.  \n \nAlthough pivotal studies on the reproductive and developmental behaviour of 5-ALA have not been \nperformed, it can be concluded that 5-ALA induced porphyrin synthesis may lead to embryotoxic \nactivity in mouse, rat and chick embryos only under the condition of direct concomitant light \nexposure. This medicinal product should, therefore, not be administered to pregnant women. \nExcessive single dose treatment of rats with 5-ALA reversibly impaired male fertility for two weeks \nafter dosing. \n \nThe majority of genotoxicity studies performed in the dark do not reveal a genotoxic potential of \n5-ALA. The compound potentially induces photogenotoxicity after subsequent irradiation or light \nexposure which is obviously related to the induction of porphyrin synthesis. \nLong-term in vivo carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. However, considering the \ntherapeutic indication, a single oral treatment with 5-ALA might not be related to any serious \npotential carcinogenic risk.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n 21 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nGliolan 30 mg/ml powder for oral solution \n5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Gliolan is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Gliolan \n3. How to take Gliolan \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Gliolan \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Gliolan is and what it is used for \n \nGliolan is used for the visualisation of certain brain tumours (called malignant glioma) during tumour \nsurgery. \n \nGliolan contains a substance called aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). 5-ALA accumulates preferably in \ntumour cells where it is transformed into another similar substance. If the tumour is then exposed to \nblue light, this new substance emits a red-violet light which helps to better see what is normal tissue \nand what is tumour tissue. This helps the surgeon to remove the tumour while sparing healthy tissue. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Gliolan \n \nDo not take Gliolan \n• if you are allergic to 5-ALA or porphyrins. \n• in case of known or suspected acute or chronic types of porphyria (i.e. inherited or acquired \n\ndisorders of certain enzymes in the synthesis pathway of red blood pigment). \n• in case of known or suspected pregnancy. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Gliolan. \n• For 24 hours after administration of this medicine, protect your eyes and skin from strong \n\nlight (for example direct sunlight or brightly focused indoor light). \n• If you have a heart disease or had heart disease in the past, you should tell your doctor. In this \n\ncase, this medicine should be used with caution because your blood pressure may be decreased. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo trials have been performed in patients with poor liver or kidney function. Therefore, this medicine \nshould be used with caution in such patients.  \n \nElderly \nThere are no special instructions for use in elderly patients with normal organ function. \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nChildren and adolescents (< 18 years) \nThere is no experience with Gliolan in children and adolescents. Therefore this medicine is not \nrecommended in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Gliolan \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, particularly medicines that may cause skin problems when the skin comes under strong \nlight (for example some types of medicines called antibiotics), but also medicines obtained without \nprescription (for example hypericin or Saint John’s wort extracts). \n \nOne case of severe sunburn lasting for 5 days has been reported in a patient after having taken this \nmedicine and a hypericin extract. You should not take any such products up to 2 weeks after you have \ntaken Gliolan. \n \nWithin 24 hours after having taken Gliolan, avoid any other medicines that may harm the liver. \n \nGliolan with food and drink \nThis medicine is generally used once only, namely 2-4 hours before anaesthesia for surgery for certain \nbrain tumours called glioma. You should not drink or eat for at least 6 hours before anaesthesia. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nIt is not known whether Gliolan will harm an unborn baby. Do not use this medicine if you are \npregnant.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether this medicine enters breast milk. Breast-feeding mothers should not \nbreast-feed for 24 hours after treatment with this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine itself has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Gliolan \n \nThis medicine is a powder that must be first mixed with drinking water before use. This is always \ndone by a pharmacist or a nurse and not by yourself. The usual dose is 20 mg 5-ALA HCl per \nkilogram body weight. The pharmacist or nurse will calculate the exact dose you need and the amount \nof the solution (in ml) you have to drink. You have to drink the prepared solution 2-4 hours before \nanaesthesia. \n \nIf the anaesthesia/surgery is delayed by some hours, additional doses of this medicine must not be \ngiven. If the surgery is delayed by one or more days, another dose of this medicine can be taken 2 – \n4 hours before anaesthesia. \n \nIf you take more Gliolan than you should \nIf you have taken more Gliolan than you should, your doctor will decide on any necessary measures to \navoid any problems, including sufficient protection from strong light (for example direct sunlight). \n \nIf you forget to take Gliolan \nThis medicine is given once only at the day of surgery, 2 – 4 hours before start of anaesthesia. If you \nhave forgotten to take this medicine during this time period, it is not advisable to take it just before \nstart of anaesthesia. In this case, anaesthesia and surgery must be postponed for at least 2 hours, if \npossible. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost serious side effects include mild alterations of blood cell counts (red and white cells, platelets), \ndisorders that affect the nervous system (neurological disorders) like partial paralysis of one side of \nthe body (hemiparesis) and blood clots that may obstruct blood vessels (thromboembolism). Further \nfrequently observed side effects are being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) and slight increase of \nsome enzymes (transaminases, γ-GT, amylase) or bilirubin (a bile pigment produced in the liver by \nbreakdown of red blood pigment) in the blood.  \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience any complaints. \n \nSide effects are divided into the following two categories: \n• immediate side effects after having taken Gliolan and before anaesthesia \n• combined side effects of Gliolan, anaesthesia, and tumour resection. \n \nAfter having taken Gliolan and before start of anaesthesia, the following side effects may occur:  \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \nFeeling sick (nausea), decrease of blood pressure (hypotension), skin reactions (for example rash, \nlooking like sunburn). \n\n \nIn combination with anaesthesia and tumour resection further side effects may occur:  \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \nMild alterations of blood cell counts (red and white cells, platelets), and slight increase of some \nenzymes (transaminases, γ-GT, amylase) or bilirubin (a bile pigment produced in the liver by \nbreakdown of red blood pigment) in the blood. These changes peak between 7 and 14 days after \nsurgery. The changes will completely resolve within a few weeks. Usually you will not \nexperience any symptoms when these changes occur. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \nFeeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), disorders that affect the nervous system \n(neurological disorders) like partial paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis), total or \npartial loss of ability to use or understand language (aphasia), seizures (convulsions) and \nblindness for half the field of vision in one or both eyes (hemianopsia), and blood clots that may \nobstruct blood vessels (thromboembolism). \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \nDecrease of blood pressure (hypotension), brain swelling (brain oedema). \n \nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) or not known (frequency cannot \nbe estimated from the available data): \nDecrease of your sense of touch (hypaesthesia), and loose or watery stools (diarrhoea).  \n \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 24 \n\n5. How to store Gliolan \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP.
