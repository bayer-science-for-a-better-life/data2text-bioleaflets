NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne ml of Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains 2 mg doxorubicin hydrochloride in a pegylated \nliposomal formulation.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in liposomes with \nsurface-bound methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG). This process is known as pegylation and protects \nliposomes from detection by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), which increases blood \ncirculation time.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nContains fully hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (from soyabean) \u2013 see section 4.3.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate)\n\nThe dispersion is sterile, translucent and red.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is indicated:\n- As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac \n\nrisk.\n- For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-based \n\nchemotherapy regimen.\n- In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients \n\nwho have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable \nfor bone marrow transplant.\n\n- For treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts \n(< 200 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line \nchemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, \nprior combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca \nalkaloid, bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified \noncologist specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal exhibits unique pharmacokinetic properties and must not be used \ninterchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\nBreast cancer/Ovarian cancer\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks \nfor as long as the disease does not progress and the patient continues to tolerate treatment.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered at 30 mg/m\u00b2 on day 4 of the bortezomib 3 week regimen \nas a 1 hour infusion administered immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The bortezomib regimen \nconsists of 1.3 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks. The dose should be repeated as long as \npatients respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. Day 4 dosing of both medicinal products may be \ndelayed up to 48 hours as medically necessary. Doses of bortezomib should be at least 72 hours apart.\n\nAIDS-related KS\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered intravenously at 20 mg/m2 every two-to-three weeks. \nAvoid intervals shorter than 10 days as medicinal product accumulation and increased toxicity cannot \nbe ruled out. Treatment of patients for two-to-three months is recommended to achieve a therapeutic \nresponse. Continue treatment as needed to maintain a therapeutic response.\n\nFor all patients\nIf the patient experiences early symptoms or signs of infusion reaction (see sections 4.4 and 4.8), \nimmediately discontinue the infusion, give appropriate premedications (antihistamine and/or short \nacting corticosteroid) and restart at a slower rate.\n\nGuidelines for Caelyx pegylated liposomal dose modification\nTo manage adverse events such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), stomatitis or \nhaematological toxicity, the dose may be reduced or delayed. Guidelines for Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal dose modification secondary to these adverse effects are provided in the tables below. The \ntoxicity grading in these tables is based on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \n(NCI-CTC).\n\nThe tables for PPE (Table 1) and stomatitis (Table 2) provide the schedule followed for dose \nmodification in clinical trials in the treatment of breast or ovarian cancer (modification of the \nrecommended 4 week treatment cycle): if these toxicities occur in patients with AIDS-related KS, the \nrecommended 2 to 3 week treatment cycle can be modified in a similar manner.\n\nThe table for haematological toxicity (Table 3) provides the schedule followed for dose modification \nin clinical trials in the treatment of patients with breast or ovarian cancer only. Dose modification in \npatients with AIDS-KS is provided following Table 4.\n\nTable 1.

Table 4, below provides the schedule \nfollowed for other dose modifications in the clinical trial in the treatment of patients with multiple \nmyeloma receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal and bortezomib combination therapy. For more \ndetailed information on bortezomib dosing and dosage adjustments, see the SPC for bortezomib.\n\nTable 4.

See the SPC for bortezomib.\n\n* for more information on bortezomib dosing and dosage adjustment, see the SPC for bortezomib\n\nFor AIDS-KS patients treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, haematological toxicity may require \ndose reduction or suspension or delay of therapy. Temporarily suspend Caelyx pegylated liposomal \ntreatment in patients when the ANC count is < 1,000/mm3 and/or the platelet count is < 50,000/mm3.\nG-CSF (or GM-CSF) may be given as concomitant therapy to support the blood count when the ANC \ncount is < 1,000/mm3 in subsequent cycles.\n\nHepatic Impairment\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal pharmacokinetics determined in a small number of patients with elevated \ntotal bilirubin levels do not differ from patients with normal total bilirubin; however, until further \nexperience is gained, the Caelyx pegylated liposomal dosage in patients with impaired hepatic \nfunction should be reduced based on the experience from the breast and ovarian clinical trial programs \nas follows: at initiation of therapy, if the bilirubin is between 1.2-3.0 mg/dl, the first dose is reduced by \n25%. If the bilirubin is > 3.0 mg/dl, the first dose is reduced by 50%. If the patient tolerates the first \ndose without an increase in serum bilirubin or liver enzymes, the dose for cycle 2 can be increased to \nthe next dose level, i.e., if reduced by 25% for the first dose, increase to full dose for cycle 2; if \nreduced by 50% for the first dose, increase to 75% of full dose for cycle 2. The dosage can be \nincreased to full dose for subsequent cycles if tolerated. Caelyx pegylated liposomal can be \nadministered to patients with liver metastases with concurrent elevation of bilirubin and liver enzymes \nup to 4 x the upper limit of the normal range. Prior to Caelyx pegylated liposomal administration, \nevaluate hepatic function using conventional clinical laboratory tests such as ALT/AST, alkaline \nphosphatase, and bilirubin.\n\nRenal Impairment\nAs doxorubicin is metabolised by the liver and excreted in the bile, dose modification should not be \nrequired. Population pharmacokinetic data (in the range of creatinine clearance tested of \n30-156 ml/min) demonstrate that Caelyx pegylated liposomal clearance is not influenced by renal \n\n\n\n6\n\nfunction. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with creatinine clearance of less than \n30 ml/min.\n\nAIDS-related KS patients with splenectomy\nAs there is no experience with Caelyx pegylated liposomal in patients who have had splenectomy, \ntreatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal is not recommended.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe experience in children is limited. Caelyx pegylated liposomal is not recommended in patients \nbelow 18 years of age.\n\nElderly\nPopulation based analysis demonstrates that age across the range tested (21\u201375 years) does not\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nMethod of administration\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered as an intravenous infusion. For further instructions on \npreparation and special precautions for handling (see section 6.6).\n\nDo not administer Caelyx pegylated liposomal as a bolus injection or undiluted dispersion. It is \nrecommended that the Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusion line be connected through the side port of \nan intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose to achieve further dilution and minimise the risk of \nthrombosis and extravasation. The infusion may be given through a peripheral vein. Do not use with \nin-line filters. Caelyx pegylated liposomal must not be given by the intramuscular or subcutaneous \nroute (see section 6.6).\n\nFor doses < 90 mg: dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 250 ml 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for \ninfusion.\nFor doses \uf0b3 90 mg: dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 500 ml 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for\ninfusion.\n\nBreast cancer/Ovarian cancer/Multiple myeloma\nTo minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose is administered at a rate no greater than \n1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction is observed, subsequent Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusions\nmay be administered over a 60-minute period.\n\nIn those patients who experience an infusion reaction, the method of infusion should be modified as \nfollows:\n5% of the total dose should be infused slowly over the first 15 minutes. If tolerated without reaction, \nthe infusion rate may then be doubled for the next 15 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be \ncompleted over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes.\n\nAIDS-related KS\nThe dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is diluted in 250 ml 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for \ninfusion and administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal must not be used to treat AIDS-KS that may be treated effectively with\nlocal therapy or systemic alfa-interferon.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGiven the difference in pharmacokinetic profiles and dosing schedules, Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nshould not be used interchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\nCardiac toxicity\nIt is recommended that all patients receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal routinely undergo frequent \nECG monitoring. Transient ECG changes such as T-wave flattening, S-T segment depression and \nbenign arrhythmias are not considered mandatory indications for the suspension of Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal therapy. However, reduction of the QRS complex is considered more indicative of cardiac \ntoxicity. If this change occurs, the most definitive test for anthracycline myocardial injury, i.e., \nendomyocardial biopsy, must be considered.\n\nMore specific methods for the evaluation and monitoring of cardiac functions as compared to ECG are \na measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography or preferably by Multigated\nAngiography (MUGA). These methods must be applied routinely before the initiation of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy and repeated periodically during treatment. The evaluation of left \nventricular function is considered to be mandatory before each additional administration of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal that exceeds a lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose of 450 mg/m2.\n\nThe evaluation tests and methods mentioned above concerning the monitoring of cardiac performance \nduring anthracycline therapy are to be employed in the following order: ECG monitoring, \nmeasurement of left ventricular ejection fraction, endomyocardial biopsy. If a test result indicates\npossible cardiac injury associated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal therapy, the benefit of continued \ntherapy must be carefully weighed against the risk of myocardial injury.\n\nIn patients with cardiac disease requiring treatment, administer Caelyx pegylated liposomal only when\nthe benefit outweighs the risk to the patient.\n\nExercise caution in patients with impaired cardiac function who receive Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nWhenever cardiomyopathy is suspected, i.e., the left ventricular ejection fraction has substantially \ndecreased relative to pre-treatment values and/or left ventricular ejection fraction is lower than a \nprognostically relevant value (e.g., < 45%), endomyocardial biopsy may be considered and the benefit \nof continued therapy must be carefully evaluated against the risk of developing irreversible cardiac \ndamage.\n\nCongestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy may occur suddenly, without prior ECG changes and \nmay also be encountered several weeks after discontinuation of therapy.\n\nCaution must be observed in patients who have received other anthracyclines. The total dose of \ndoxorubicin hydrochloride must also take into account any previous (or concomitant) therapy with \ncardiotoxic compounds such as other anthracyclines/anthraquinones or e.g., 5-fluorouracil. Cardiac \ntoxicity also may occur at cumulative anthracycline doses lower than 450 mg/m2 in patients with prior \nmediastinal irradiation or in those receiving concurrent cyclophosphamide therapy.\n\nThe cardiac safety profile for the dosing schedule recommended for both breast and ovarian cancer \n(50 mg/m2) is similar to the 20 mg/m2 profile in patients with AIDS-KS (see section 4.8).\n\nMyelosuppression\nMany patients treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal have baseline myelosuppression due to such \nfactors as their pre-existing HIV disease or numerous concomitant or previous medications, or\ntumours involving bone marrow. In the pivotal trial in patients with ovarian cancer treated at a dose of \n50 mg/m2, myelosuppression was generally mild to moderate, reversible, and was not associated with \nepisodes of neutropaenic infection or sepsis. Moreover, in a controlled clinical trial of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal vs. topotecan, the incidence of treatment related sepsis was substantially less in \nthe Caelyx pegylated liposomal-treated ovarian cancer patients as compared to the topotecan treatment \n\n\n\n8\n\ngroup. A similar low incidence of myelosuppression was seen in patients with metastatic breast cancer \nreceiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal in a first-line clinical trial. In contrast to the experience in \npatients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, myelosuppression appears to be the dose-limiting \nadverse event in patients with AIDS-KS (see section 4.8). Because of the potential for bone marrow \nsuppression, periodic blood counts must be performed frequently during the course of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy, and at a minimum, prior to each dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nPersistent severe myelosuppression, may result in superinfection or haemorrhage.\n\nIn controlled clinical studies in patients with AIDS-KS against a bleomycin/vincristine regimen, \nopportunistic infections were apparently more frequent during treatment with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal. Patients and doctors must be aware of this higher incidence and take action as appropriate.\n\nSecondary haematological malignancies\nAs with other DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, secondary acute myeloid leukemias and \nmyelodysplasias have been reported in patients having received combined treatment with doxorubicin. \nTherefore, any patient treated with doxorubicin should be kept under haematological supervision.\n\nSecondary oral neoplasms\nVery rare cases of secondary oral cancer have been reported in patients with long-term (more than one \nyear) exposure to Caelyx pegylated liposomal or those receiving a cumulative Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal dose greater than 720 mg/m2. Cases of secondary oral cancer were diagnosed both, during \ntreatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, and up to 6 years after the last dose. Patients should be \nexamined at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or any oral discomfort that may be \nindicative of secondary oral cancer.\n\nInfusion-associated reactions\nSerious and sometimes life-threatening infusion reactions, which are characterised by allergic-like or \nanaphylactoid-like reactions, with symptoms including asthma, flushing, urticarial rash, chest pain, \nfever, hypertension, tachycardia, pruritus, sweating, shortness of breath, facial oedema, chills, back \npain, tightness in the chest and throat and/or hypotension may occur within minutes of starting the \ninfusion of Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Very rarely, convulsions also have been observed in relation \nto infusion reactions. Temporarily stopping the infusion usually resolves these symptoms without\nfurther therapy. However, medications to treat these symptoms (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, \nadrenaline, and anticonvulsants), as well as emergency equipment should be available for immediate \nuse. In most patients treatment can be resumed after all symptoms have resolved, without recurrence. \nInfusion reactions rarely recur after the first treatment cycle. To minimise the risk of infusion \nreactions, the initial dose should be administered at a rate no greater than 1 mg/minute (see section \n4.2).\n\nPalmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPE)\nPPE is characterised by painful, macular reddening skin eruptions. In patients experiencing this event, \nit is generally seen after two or three cycles of treatment. Improvement usually occurs in 1-2 weeks, \nand in some cases, may take up to 4 weeks or longer for complete resolution. Pyridoxine at a dose of \n50-150 mg per day and corticosteroids have been used for the prophylaxis and treatment of PPE, \nhowever, these therapies have not been evaluated in phase III trials. Other strategies to prevent and \ntreat PPE include keeping hands and feet cool, by exposing them to cool water (soaks, baths, or \nswimming), avoiding excessive heat/hot water and keeping them unrestricted (no socks, gloves, or \nshoes that are tight fitting). PPE appears to be primarily related to the dose schedule and can be \nreduced by extending the dose interval 1- 2 weeks (see section 4.2). However, this reaction can be \nsevere and debilitating in some patients and may require discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nExtravasation\nAlthough local necrosis following extravasation has been reported very rarely, Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal is considered to be an irritant. Animal studies indicate that administration of doxorubicin \nhydrochloride as a liposomal formulation reduces the potential for extravasation injury. If any signs or \nsymptoms of extravasation occur (e.g., stinging, erythema) terminate the infusion immediately and \n\n\n\n9\n\nrestart in another vein. The application of ice over the site of extravasation for approximately 30 \nminutes may be helpful in alleviating the local reaction. Caelyx pegylated liposomal must not be given \nby the intramuscular or subcutaneous route. \n\nDiabetic patients\nPlease note that each vial of Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains sucrose and the dose is administered \nin 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for infusion.\n\nExcipients\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose and is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nFor common adverse events which required dose modification or discontinuation see section 4.8.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal medicinal product interaction studies have been performed with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal, although phase II combination trials with conventional chemotherapy agents have been \nconducted in patients with gynaecological malignancies. Exercise caution in the concomitant use of \nmedicinal products known to interact with standard doxorubicin hydrochloride. Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal, like other doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations, may potentiate the toxicity of other \nanti-cancer therapies. During clinical trials in patients with solid tumours (including breast and ovarian \ncancer) who have received concomitant cyclophosphamide or taxanes, no new additive toxicities were \nnoted. In patients with AIDS, exacerbation of cyclophosphamide-induced haemorrhagic cystitis and \nenhancement of the hepatotoxicity of 6-mercaptopurine have been reported with standard doxorubicin \nhydrochloride. Caution must be exercised when giving any other cytotoxic agents, especially \nmyelotoxic agents, at the same time.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nDoxorubicin hydrochloride is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Therefore, Caelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary.\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential\nWomen of child-bearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while they or their male partner \nare receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal and in the six months following discontinuation of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether Caelyx pegylated liposomal is excreted in human milk. Because many\nmedicinal products, including anthracyclines, are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential \nfor serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, therefore mothers must discontinue nursing prior to \nbeginning Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment. Health experts recommend that HIV infected women\ndo not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of doxorubicin hydrochloride on human fertility has not been evaluated (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHowever, in clinical studies to date, dizziness and somnolence were associated infrequently (< 5%) \nwith the administration of Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Patients who suffer from these effects must \navoid driving and operating machinery.\n\n\n\n10\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) were neutropaenia, nausea, leukopaenia, anaemia, and \nfatigue.\n\nSevere adverse reactions (Grade 3/4 adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 2% of patients) were \nneutropaenia, PPE, leukopaenia, lymphopaenia, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, stomatitis, fatigue, \ndiarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, pyrexia, dyspnoea, and pneumonia. Less frequently reported severe\nadverse reactions included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, abdominal pain, cytomegalovirus \ninfection including cytomegalovirus chorioretinitis, asthenia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, cardiac \nfailure congestive, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, anaphylactic reaction, \nanaphylactoid reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 5 summarises the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal in 4,231 patients for the treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and \nAIDS-related KS. Post-marketing adverse reactions are also included, as indicated by \u201cb\u201d. Frequencies \nare defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). Within each frequency grouping, where relevant, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 5: Adverse reactions in patients treated with Caelyx pegylated

common undesirable effect reported in breast/ovarian clinical trials was palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia (PPE). The overall incidence of PPE reported was 41.3% and 51.1% in the ovarian \n\n\n\n14\n\nand breast clinical trials, respectively. These effects were mostly mild, with severe (grade 3) cases \nreported in 16.3% and 19.6% of patients. The reported incidence of life-threatening (grade 4) cases \nwas < 1%. PPE infrequently resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation (1.9% and 10.8%). PPE \nwas reported in 16% of multiple myeloma patients treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus \nbortezomib combination therapy. Grade 3 PPE was reported in 5% of patients. No grade 4 PPE was \nreported. The rate of PPE was substantially lower in the AIDS-KS population (1.3% all grade, 0.4%\ngrade 3 PPE, no grade 4 PPE).  See section 4.4.\n\nOpportunistic infections\nRespiratory undesirable effects commonly occurred in clinical studies of Caelyx pegylated liposomal \nand may be related to opportunistic infections (OI\u2019s) in the AIDS population. Opportunistic infections \nare observed in KS patients after administration with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, and are frequently \nobserved in patients with HIV induced immunodeficiency. The most frequently observed OI\u2019s in \nclinical studies were candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, \nand mycobacterium avium complex.\n\nCardiac toxicity\nAn increased incidence of congestive heart failure is associated with doxorubicin therapy at\ncumulative lifetime doses > 450 mg/m2 or at lower doses for patients with cardiac risk factors. \nEndomyocardial biopsies on nine of ten AIDS-KS patients receiving cumulative doses of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal greater than 460 mg/m2 indicate no evidence of anthracycline-induced \ncardiomyopathy. The recommended dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal for AIDS-KS patients is\n20 mg/m2 every two-to-three weeks. The cumulative dose at which cardiotoxicity would become a \nconcern for these AIDS-KS patients (> 400 mg/m2) would require more than 20 courses of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy over 40 to 60 weeks.\n\nIn addition, endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 8 solid tumour patients with cumulative \nanthracycline doses of 509 mg/m2\u20131,680 mg/m2. The range of Billingham cardiotoxicity scores was \ngrades 0-1.5. These grading scores are consistent with no or mild cardiac toxicity.\n\nIn the pivotal phase III trial versus doxorubicin, 58/509 (11.4%) randomised subjects (10 treated with \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal at a dose of 50 mg/m2/every 4 weeks versus 48 treated with doxorubicin \nat a dose of 60 mg/m2/every 3 weeks) met the protocol-defined criteria for cardiac toxicity during\ntreatment and/or follow-up. Cardiac toxicity was defined as a decrease of 20 points or greater from \nbaseline if the resting LVEF remained in the normal range or a decrease of 10 points or greater if the \nLVEF became abnormal (less than the lower limit for normal). None of the 10 Caelyx pegylated\nliposomal subjects who had cardiac toxicity by LVEF criteria developed signs and symptoms of CHF. \nIn contrast, 10 of 48 doxorubicin subjects who had cardiac toxicity by LVEF criteria also developed \nsigns and symptoms of CHF.\n\nIn patients with solid tumours, including a subset of patients with breast and ovarian cancers, treated at \na dose of 50 mg/m2/cycle with lifetime cumulative anthracycline doses up to 1,532 mg/m2, the\nincidence of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction was low. Of the 418 patients treated with \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal 50 mg/m2/cycle, and having a baseline measurement of left ventricular \nejection fraction (LVEF) and at least one follow-up measurement assessed by MUGA scan, \n88 patients had a cumulative anthracycline dose of > 400 mg/m2, an exposure level associated with an \nincreased risk of cardiovascular toxicity with conventional doxorubicin. Only 13 of these 88 patients \n(15%) had at least one clinically significant change in their LVEF, defined as an LVEF value less than \n45% or a decrease of at least 20 points from baseline. Furthermore, only 1 patient (cumulative \nanthracycline dose of 944 mg/m2), discontinued study treatment because of clinical symptoms of\ncongestive heart failure.\n\nRadiation recall phenomenon\nRecall of skin reaction due to prior radiotherapy has occurred uncommonly with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal administration.\n\n\n\n15\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAcute overdosing with doxorubicin hydrochloride worsens the toxic effects of mucositis, leukopaenia \nand thrombocytopaenia. Treatment of acute overdose of the severely myelosuppressed patient consists \nof hospitalisation, antibiotics, platelet and granulocyte transfusions and symptomatic treatment of \nmucositis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cytotoxic agents (anthracyclines and related substances), ATC code: \nL01DB01.\n\nMechanism of action\nThe active ingredient of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is doxorubicin hydrochloride, a cytotoxic \nanthracycline antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. The exact mechanism of \nthe antitumour activity of doxorubicin is not known. It is generally believed that inhibition of DNA, \nRNA and protein synthesis is responsible for the majority of the cytotoxic effects. This is probably the \nresult of intercalation of the anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of the DNA double helix thus \npreventing their unwinding for replication.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nA phase III randomised study of Caelyx pegylated liposomal versus doxorubicin in patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer was completed in 509 patients. The protocol-specified objective of \ndemonstrating non-inferiority between Caelyx pegylated liposomal and doxorubicin was met, the \nhazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.00 (95% CI for HR=0.82-1.22). The\ntreatment HR for PFS when adjusted for prognostic variables was consistent with PFS for the ITT\npopulation.\n\nThe primary analysis of cardiac toxicity showed the risk of developing a cardiac event as a function of \ncumulative anthracycline dose was significantly lower with Caelyx pegylated liposomal than with \ndoxorubicin (HR=3.16, p < 0.001). At cumulative doses greater than 450 mg/m2 there were no cardiac \nevents with Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nA phase III comparative study of Caelyx pegylated liposomal versus topotecan in patients with \nepithelial ovarian cancer following the failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy was \ncompleted in 474 patients. There was a benefit in overall survival (OS) for Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal-treated patients over topotecan-treated patients as indicated by a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.216 \n(95% CI: 1.000; 1.478), p=0.050. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 56.3%, 34.7% and 20.2%\nrespectively on Caelyx pegylated liposomal, compared to 54.0%, 23.6% and 13.2% on topotecan.\n\nFor the sub-group of patients with platinum-sensitive disease the difference was greater: HR of 1.432\n(95% CI: 1.066; 1.923), p=0.017. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 74.1%, 51.2% and 28.4%\nrespectively on Caelyx pegylated liposomal, compared to 66.2%, 31.0% and 17.5% on topotecan.\n\nThe treatments were similar in the sub-group of patients with platinum-refractory disease: HR of 1.069 \n(95% CI: 0.823; 1.387), p=0.618. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 41.5%, 21.1% and 13.8%\nrespectively on Caelyx pegylated liposomal, compared to 43.2%, 17.2% and 9.5% on topotecan.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\nA phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study comparing the safety and \nefficacy of Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib combination therapy with bortezomib \nmonotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who \ndid not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy, was conducted in 646 patients. There\nwas a significant improvement in the primary endpoint of time to progression (TTP) for patients \ntreated with combination therapy of Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib compared to patients \ntreated with bortezomib monotherapy as indicated by a risk reduction (RR) of 35% (95% CI: 21-47%), \np < 0.0001, based on 407 TTP events. The median TTP was 6.9 months for the bortezomib \nmonotherapy patients compared with 8.9 months for the Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib \ncombination therapy patients. A protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) \ntriggered early study termination for efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of \n45% (95% CI: 29-57%), p < 0.0001. The median TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib \nmonotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for the Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib \ncombination therapy patients. These results, though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final \nanalysis. The final analysis for overall survival (OS) performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years \nshowed no significant difference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was \n30.8 months (95% CI; 25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months \n(95% CI; 28.9-37.1 months) for the Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib combination therapy \npatients.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is a long-circulating pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin \nhydrochloride. Pegylated liposomes contain surface-grafted segments of the hydrophilic polymer \nmethoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG). These linear MPEG groups extend from the liposome surface \ncreating a protective coating that reduces interactions between the lipid bilayer membrane and the \nplasma components. This allows the Caelyx pegylated liposomal liposomes to circulate for prolonged \nperiods in the blood stream. Pegylated liposomes are small enough (average diameter of \napproximately 100 nm) to pass intact (extravasate) through defective blood vessels supplying tumours. \nEvidence of penetration of pegylated liposomes from blood vessels and their entry and accumulation \nin tumours has been seen in mice with C-26 colon carcinoma tumours and in transgenic mice with \nKS-like lesions. The pegylated liposomes also have a low permeability lipid matrix and internal \naqueous buffer system that combine to keep doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated during liposome \nresidence time in circulation.\n\nThe plasma pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal in humans differ significantly from those\nreported in the literature for standard doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations. At lower doses \n(10 mg/m2\u201320 mg/m2) Caelyx pegylated liposomal displayed linear pharmacokinetics. Over the dose \nrange of 10 mg/m2\u201360 mg/m2 Caelyx pegylated liposomal displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics. \nStandard doxorubicin hydrochloride displays extensive tissue distribution (volume of distribution: 700\nto 1,100 l/m2) and a rapid elimination clearance (24 to 73 l/h/m2). In contrast, the pharmacokinetic \nprofile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal indicates that Caelyx pegylated liposomal is confined mostly to \nthe vascular fluid volume and that the clearance of doxorubicin from the blood is dependent upon the \nliposomal carrier. Doxorubicin becomes available after the liposomes are extravasated and enter the\ntissue compartment.\n\nAt equivalent doses, the plasma concentration and AUC values of Caelyx pegylated liposomal which \nrepresent mostly pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (containing 90% to 95% of the \nmeasured doxorubicin) are significantly higher than those achieved with standard doxorubicin\nhydrochloride preparations.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used interchangeably with other formulations of \ndoxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\n\n\n17\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal was evaluated in 120 patients from 10 different \nclinical trials using the population pharmacokinetic approach. The pharmacokinetics of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal over the dose range of 10 mg/m2 to 60 mg/m2 was best described by a two \ncompartment non-linear model with zero order input and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The mean \nintrinsic clearance of Caelyx pegylated liposomal was 0.030 l/h/m2 (range 0.008 to 0.152 l/h/m2) and \nthe mean central volume of distribution was 1.93 l/m2 (range 0.96-3.85 l/m2) approximating the plasma \nvolume. The apparent half-life ranged from 24-231 hours, with a mean of 73.9 hours.\n\nBreast cancer patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal determined in 18 patients with breast carcinoma \nwere similar to the pharmacokinetics determined in the larger population of 120 patients with various \ncancers. The mean intrinsic clearance was 0.016 l/h/m2 (range 0.008-0.027 l/h/m2), the mean central \nvolume of distribution was 1.46 l/m2 (range 1.10-1.64 l/m2). The mean apparent half-life was \n71.5 hours (range 45.2-98.5 hours).\n\nOvarian cancer patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal determined in 11 patients with ovarian \ncarcinoma were similar to the pharmacokinetics determined in the larger population of 120 patients \nwith various cancers. The mean intrinsic clearance was 0.021 l/h/m2 (range 0.009\u20130.041 l/h/m2), the \nmean central volume of distribution was 1.95 l/m2 (range 1.67\u20132.40 l/m2). The mean apparent half-life \nwas 75.0 hours (range 36.1\u2013125 hours).\n\nAIDS-related KS patients\nThe plasma pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal were evaluated in 23 patients with KS \nwho received single doses of 20 mg/m2 administered by a 30-minute infusion. The pharmacokinetic \nparameters of Caelyx pegylated liposomal (primarily representing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \nhydrochloride and low levels of unencapsulated doxorubicin hydrochloride) observed after the \n20 mg/m2 doses are presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6.

With Caelyx pegylated liposomal, the encapsulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride in \npegylated liposomes results in these effects having a differing strength, as follows.\n\nCardiotoxicity\nStudies in rabbits have shown that the cardiotoxicity of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is reduced\ncompared with conventional doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations.\n\nDermal toxicity\nIn studies performed after the repeated administration of Caelyx pegylated liposomal to rats and dogs, \nserious dermal inflammations and ulcer formations were observed at clinically relevant dosages. In the \n\n\n\n18\n\nstudy in dogs, the occurrence and severity of these lesions was reduced by lowering the dose or \nprolonging the intervals between doses. Similar dermal lesions, which are described as palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia were also observed in patients after long-term intravenous infusion (see section \n4.8).\n\nAnaphylactoid response\nDuring repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs, an acute response characterised by hypotension, pale \nmucous membranes, salivation, emesis and periods of hyperactivity followed by hypoactivity and \nlethargy was observed following administration of pegylated liposomes (placebo). A similar, but less\nsevere response was also noted in dogs treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal and standard\ndoxorubicin.\n\nThe hypotensive response was reduced in magnitude by pretreatment with antihistamines. However, \nthe response was not life-threatening and the dogs recovered quickly upon discontinuation of\ntreatment.\n\nLocal toxicity\nSubcutaneous tolerance studies indicate that Caelyx pegylated liposomal, as against standard \ndoxorubicin hydrochloride, causes slighter local irritation or damage to the tissue after a possible\nextravasation.\n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity\nAlthough no studies have been conducted with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, doxorubicin \nhydrochloride, the pharmacologically active ingredient of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, is mutagenic \nand carcinogenic. Pegylated placebo liposomes are neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal resulted in mild to moderate ovarian and testicular atrophy in mice after a \nsingle dose of 36 mg/kg. Decreased testicular weights and hypospermia were present in rats after \nrepeat doses \uf0b3 0.25 mg/kg/day and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a marked \ndecrease in spermatogenesis were observed in dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).\n\nNephrotoxicity\nA study has shown that Caelyx pegylated liposomal at a single intravenous dose of over twice the \nclinical dose produces renal toxicity in monkeys. Renal toxicity has been observed with even lower \nsingle doses of doxorubicin HCl in rats and rabbits. Since an evaluation of the post-marketing safety \ndatabase for Caelyx pegylated liposomal in patients has not suggested a significant nephrotoxicity \nliability of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, these findings in monkeys may not have relevance to patient \nrisk assessment.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,\n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Caelyx pegylated liposomal is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n3. How to use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n4. Possible side effects\n5 How to store Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Caelyx pegylated liposomal is and what it is used for\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is an antitumour agent.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is used to treat cancer of the breast in patients at risk for heart problems. \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to treat cancer of the ovary. It is used to kill cancer cells, \nshrink the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to treat\nmultiple myeloma (a cancer of the blood) in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma \nincluding flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. Other symptoms of Kaposi\u2019s \nsarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a way as to \nselectively kill cancer cells. The doxorubicin hydrochloride in Caelyx pegylated liposomal is enclosed \nin tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to deliver the medicinal product from the blood\nstream to the cancerous tissue rather than healthy normal tissue.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n\nDo not use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n- if you are allergic to doxorubicin hydrochloride, peanut or soya, or any of the ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nYou should tell your doctor about any of the following:\n- if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease;\n- if you are diabetic, because Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains sugar which may require an \n\nadjustment to the treatment of your diabetes;\n- if you have Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and have had your spleen removed;\n- if you notice sores, discolouration or any discomfort in your mouth.\n\n\n\n33\n\nChildren and adolescents\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is not known \nhow the medicine will affect them.\n\nOther medicines and Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nTell your doctor or pharmacist\n- if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained \n\nwithout a prescription;\n- about any other cancer treatments you are on or have been taking, as particular care needs to be \n\ntaken with treatments which reduce the number of white blood cells, as this may cause further\nreduction in the number of white blood cells. If you are unsure about what treatments you have \nreceived or any illnesses you have had, discuss these with your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nBecause the active ingredient doxorubicin hydrochloride in Caelyx pegylated liposomal may cause \nbirth defects, it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant. Avoid becoming \npregnant while you or your partner are taking Caelyx pegylated liposomal and in the six months \nfollowing discontinuation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment.\n\nBecause doxorubicin hydrochloride may be harmful to nursing infants, women must discontinue \nbreast-feeding before starting treatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Health experts recommend \nthat HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid \ntransmission of HIV.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy from treatment with Caelyx \npegylated liposomal.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains soya oil and sodium\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains soya oil.  If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this\nmedicine.\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say \n\u2018essentially sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is a unique formulation. It must not be used interchangeably with other \nformulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\nHow much Caelyx pegylated liposomal is given\nIf you are being treated for breast cancer or ovarian cancer, Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be \nadministered at a dose of 50 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and \nweight). The dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are \nable to tolerate the treatment.\n\nIf you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your body\nsurface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 4 of the \nbortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The dose is repeated as long as \nyou respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment.\n\nIf you are being treated for Kaposi\u2019sarcoma, Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a \ndose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). The dose\n\n\n\n34\n\nis repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an improvement \nin your condition.\n\nHow Caelyx pegylated liposomal is given\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. \nDepending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e.,\n90 minutes).\n\nIf you use more Caelyx pegylated liposomal than you should\nAcute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood \ncells and platelets in the blood. Treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell \ntransfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment \nof mouth sores.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

The use of gloves is \nrequired. If Caelyx pegylated liposomal comes into contact with skin or mucosa, wash immediately\nand thoroughly with soap and water. Caelyx pegylated liposomal must be handled and disposed of in a \nmanner consistent with that of other anticancer medicinal products.\n\nDetermine the dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal to be administered (based upon the recommended\ndose and the patient's body surface area). Take the appropriate volume of Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nup into a sterile syringe. Aseptic technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or \nbacteriostatic agent is present in Caelyx pegylated liposomal. The appropriate dose of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal must be diluted in 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for infusion prior to \nadministration. For doses < 90 mg, dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 250 ml, and for doses \n\uf0b3 90 mg, dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 500 ml.\n\nTo minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose is administered at a rate no greater than \n1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction is observed, subsequent Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusions \nmay be administered over a 60-minute period.\n\nIn the breast cancer trial program, modification of the infusion was permitted for those patients \nexperiencing an infusion reaction as follows: 5% of the total dose was infused slowly over the first \n15 minutes. If tolerated without reaction, the infusion rate was doubled for the next 15 minutes. If \ntolerated, the infusion was completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes.\n\nIf the patient experiences early symptoms or signs of infusion reaction, immediately discontinue the \ninfusion, give appropriate premedications (antihistamine and/or short acting corticosteroid) and restart \nat a slower rate.\n\nThe use of any diluent other than 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for infusion, or the presence of any \nbacteriostatic agent such as benzyl alcohol may cause precipitation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nIt is recommended that the Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusion line be connected through the side \nport of an intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose. Infusion may be given through a peripheral \nvein. Do not use with in-line filters.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival. caelyx pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to treat multiple myeloma (a cancer of the blood) in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. caelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your kaposi's sarcoma including flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. other symptoms of kaposi's sarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear. caelyx pegylated liposomal contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a way as to selectively kill cancer cells. the doxorubicin hydrochloride in caelyx pegylated liposomal is enclosed in tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to

body surface area (based on your height and weight). the dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are able to tolerate the treatment. if you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, caelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 4 of the bortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. the dose is repeated as long as you respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. if you are being treated for kaposi'sarcoma, caelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). the dose 34 is repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an improvement in your condition. how caelyx pegylated liposomal is given caelyx pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. depending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e., 90 minutes). if you use more caelyx pegylated liposomal than you should acute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood cells and platelets in the blood. treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell transfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment of mouth sores. if you

(asthma) - flushing, sweating, chills or a fever - chest pain or discomfort - back pain - high or low blood pressure - fast heart beat - fits (seizures) leaking of the injection fluid from the veins into the tissues under the skin may occur. if the drip stings or hurts while you are receiving a dose of caelyx pegylated liposomal, tell your doctor immediately. your doctor should be contacted immediately if any of the following serious side effects are noticed: - you develop fever, feel tired, or if you have signs of bruising or bleeding (very common) - redness, swelling, peeling or tenderness, mainly on the hands or feet ('hand-foot' syndrome). these effects have been seen very commonly and are sometimes severe. in severe cases, these effects may interfere with certain daily activities, and may last for 4 weeks or longer before resolving completely. the doctor may wish to delay the start and/or reduce the dose of the next treatment (see strategies to prevent and treat hand foot syndrome, below) - sores in mouth, severe diarrhoea or vomiting or nausea (very common) - infections (common), including lung infections (pneumonia) or infections that may affect your vision

more than 1 in 10 people) - decrease in the number of white blood cells, which can increase the chances of infections. in rare cases, having low white blood cells may lead to severe infection. anaemia (reduction in red blood cells) may cause tiredness, and decreased platelets in the blood may increase the risk of bleeding. it is because of the potential changes in your blood cells that you will have regular blood tests. - decreased appetite; - constipation; - skin rashes, including redness of the skin, allergic skin rash, red or raised rash on the skin - hair loss - pain including in the muscles and chest muscle, joint, arm, or leg - feeling very tired common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) - infections, including severe infection throughout the body (sepsis), lung
