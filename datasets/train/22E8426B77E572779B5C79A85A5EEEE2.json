This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Health care professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nVyndaqel 20 mg soft capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach soft capsule contains 20 mg of micronized tafamidis meglumine equivalent to 12.2 mg tafamidis.\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach soft capsule contains no more than 44 mg of sorbitol (E 420).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSoft capsule.\n\nYellow, opaque, oblong (approximately 21 mm) capsule imprinted with \u201cVYN 20\u201d in red.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nVyndaqel is indicated for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 \nsymptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician knowledgeable in the management \nof patients with transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN).\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of tafamidis meglumine is 20 mg orally once daily.\n\nTafamidis and tafamidis meglumine are not interchangeable on a per mg basis.\n\nIf vomiting occurs after dosing, and the intact Vyndaqel capsule is identified, then an additional dose \nof Vyndaqel should be administered if possible. If no capsule is identified, then no additional dose is \nnecessary, with resumption of dosing the next day as usual.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) (see section 5.2).\n\n\n\n3\n\nHepatic and renal impairment\n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal or mild and moderate hepatic impairment. \nLimited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or \nequal to 30 mL/min). Tafamidis meglumine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment and caution is recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of tafamidis in the paediatric population. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\n\nThe soft capsules should be swallowed whole and not crushed or cut. Vyndaqel may be taken with or \nwithout food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use appropriate contraception when taking tafamidis \nmeglumine and continue to use appropriate contraception for 1-month after stopping treatment with \ntafamidis meglumine (see section 4.6).\n\nTafamidis meglumine should be added to the standard of care for the treatment of patients with \nATTR-PN. Physicians should monitor patients and continue to assess the need for other therapy, \nincluding the need for liver transplantation, as part of this standard of care. As there are no data \navailable regarding the use of tafamidis meglumine post-liver transplantation, tafamidis meglumine \nshould be discontinued in patients who undergo liver transplantation.\n\nThis medicinal product contains no more than 44 mg sorbitol in each capsule.\n\nThe additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. \n\nThe content of sorbitol in medicinal products for oral use may affect the bioavailability of other \nmedicinal products for oral use administered concomitantly.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nIn a clinical study in healthy volunteers, 20 mg tafamidis meglumine did not induce or inhibit the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.\n\nIn vitro tafamidis inhibits the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) with \nIC50=1.16 \u00b5M and may cause drug-drug interactions at clinically relevant concentrations with \nsubstrates of this transporter (e.g. methotrexate, rosuvastatin, imatinib) following a 20 mg tafamidis \nmeglumine dose. Likewise, tafamidis inhibits the uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3 (organic anion \ntransporters) with IC50=2.9 \u00b5M and IC50=2.36 \u00b5M, respectively, and may cause drug-drug \ninteractions at clinically relevant concentrations with substrates of these transporters (e.g. non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs, bumetanide, furosemide, lamivudine, methotrexate, oseltamivir, tenofovir, \nganciclovir, adefovir, cidofovir, zidovudine, zalcitabine). Based on in vitro data, the maximal \npredicted changes in AUC of OAT1 and OAT3 substrates were determined to be less than 1.25 for the \n\n\n\n4\n\ntafamidis meglumine 20 mg dose, therefore, inhibition of OAT1 or OAT3 transporters by tafamidis is \nnot expected to result in clinically significant interactions.\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed evaluating the effect of other medicinal products on \ntafamidis meglumine.\n\nLaboratory test abnormality\n\nTafamidis may decrease serum concentrations of total thyroxine, without an accompanying change in \nfree thyroxine (T4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This observation in total thyroxine values \nmay likely be the result of reduced thyroxine binding to or displacement from transthyretin (TTR) due \nto the high binding affinity tafamidis has to the TTR thyroxine receptor. No corresponding clinical \nfindings consistent with thyroid dysfunction have been observed.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nContraceptive measures should be used by women of childbearing potential during treatment with \ntafamidis meglumine, and for one month after stopping treatment, due to the prolonged half-life.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data on the use of tafamidis meglumine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Tafamidis meglumine is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nAvailable data in animals have shown excretion of tafamidis in milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Tafamidis meglumine should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nNo impairment of fertility has been observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, tafamidis meglumine is believed to \nhave no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe overall clinical data reflect exposure of 127 patients with ATTR-PN to 20 mg of tafamidis \nmeglumine administered daily for an average of 538 days (ranging from 15 to 994 days). The adverse \nreactions were generally mild or moderate in severity.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency categories \nusing the standard convention: Very common (\uf0b3 1/10), Common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10), and Uncommon \n(\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within the frequency group, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions reported from the clinical programme in the tabular listing \nbelow reflect the rates at which they occurred in the Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study \n(Fx-005).\n\n\n\n5\n\nSystem Organ Class Very Common\nInfections and infestations Urinary tract infection\n\nVaginal infection\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea\n\nUpper abdominal pain\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere is minimal clinical experience with overdose. During clinical trials, two patients diagnosed with \ntransthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) accidentally ingested a single tafamidis \nmeglumine dose of 160 mg without the occurrence of any associated adverse events. The highest dose \nof tafamidis meglumine given to healthy volunteers in a clinical trial was 480 mg as a single dose. \nThere was one reported treatment-related adverse event of mild hordeolum at this dose.\n\nManagement\n\nIn case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGIC PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code N07XX08\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTafamidis is a selective stabiliser of TTR. Tafamidis binds to TTR at the thyroxine binding sites, \nstabilising the tetramer and slowing dissociation into monomers, the rate-limiting step in the \namyloidogenic process.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nTransthyretin amyloidosis is a severely debilitating condition induced by the accumulation of various \ninsoluble fibrillar proteins, or amyloid, within the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal \nfunction. The dissociation of the transthyretin tetramer to monomers is the rate-limiting step in the \npathogenesis of transthyretin amyloidosis. The folded monomers undergo partial denaturation to \nproduce alternatively folded monomeric amyloidogenic intermediates. These intermediates then \nmisassemble into soluble oligomers, profilaments, filaments, and amyloid fibrils. Tafamidis binds with \nnegative cooperativity to the two thyroxine binding sites on the native tetrameric form of transthyretin \npreventing dissociation into monomers. The inhibition of TTR tetramer dissociation forms the \nrationale for the use of tafamidis to slow disease progression in stage 1 ATTR-PN patients.\n\nA TTR stabilisation assay was utilised as a pharmacodynamic marker and assessed the stability of the \nTTR tetramer. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6\n\nTafamidis stabilised both the wild-type TTR tetramer and the tetramers of 14 TTR variants tested \nclinically after once-daily dosing with tafamidis. Tafamidis also stabilised the TTR tetramer for \n25 variants tested ex vivo, thus demonstrating TTR stabilisation of 40 amyloidogenic TTR genotypes.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe pivotal study of tafamidis meglumine in stage 1 ATTR-PN patients was an 18-month, multicentre, \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of \nonce-daily 20 mg tafamidis meglumine in 128 patients with ATTR-PN with the V30M mutation and \nprimarily stage 1 disease; 126 of the 128 patients did not routinely require assistance with ambulation. \nThe primary outcome measures were the Neuropathy Impairment Score of the Lower Limb (NIS-LL \u2013\na physician assessment of the neurologic exam of the lower limbs) and the Norfolk Quality of Life -\nDiabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN \u2013 a patient reported outcome, total quality of life score \n[TQOL]). Other outcome measures included composite scores of large nerve fibre (nerve conduction, \nvibration threshold and heart rate response to deep breathing - HRDB) and small nerve fibre function \n(heat pain and cooling threshold and HRDB) and nutritional assessments utilizing the modified body \nmass index (mBMI \u2013 BMI multiplied by serum albumin in g/L). Eighty-six of the 91 patients \ncompleting the 18 month treatment period subsequently enrolled in an open-label extension study, \nwhere they all received once daily 20 mg tafamidis meglumine for an additional 12 months.\n\nFollowing 18 months of treatment, more tafamidis meglumine-treated patients were NIS-LL \nResponders (change of less than 2 points on NIS-LL) Outcomes for the pre-specified analyses of the \nprimary endpoints are provided in the following table:\n\nVyndaqel versus Placebo: NIS-LL and TQOL at Month 18 (Study Fx-005)\nPlacebo Vyndaqel\n\nPre-specified ITT Analysis N=61 N=64\nNIS-LL Responders (% Patients) 29.5% 45.3%\n\nDifference (Vyndaqel minus Placebo)\n95% CI of Difference (p-value)\n\n15.8%\n-0.9%, 32.5% (0.068)\n\nTQOL Change from Baseline LSMean (SE) 7.2 (2.36) 2.0 (2.31)\nDifference in LSMeans (SE)\n95% CI of Difference (p-value)\n\n-5.2 (3.31)\n-11.8, 1.3 (0.116)\n\nPre-specified Efficacy Evaluable Analysis N=42 N=45\nNIS-LL Responders (% Patients) 38.1% 60.0%\n\nDifference (Vyndaqel minus Placebo)\n95% CI of Difference (p-value)\n\n21.9%\n1.4%, 42.4% (0.041)\n\nTQOL Change from Baseline LSMean (SE) 8.9 (3.08) 0.1 (2.98)\nDifference in LSMeans (SE)\n95% CI of Difference (p-value)\n\n-8.8 (4.32)\n-17.4, -0.2 (0.045)\n\nIn the pre-specified ITT NIS-LL Responder analysis, patients who discontinued prior to the 18-month time point due to liver \ntransplantation were categorized as non-responders. The pre-specified Efficacy Evaluable analysis used observed data for those patients \nwho completed the 18 month treatment per protocol.\n\nThe secondary endpoints demonstrated that tafamidis meglumine treatment resulted in less \ndeterioration of neurologic function and improved nutritional status (mBMI) compared with placebo, \nas shown in the following table. \n\nSecondary Endpoints Changes from Baseline to Month 18 LSMean (Standard Error) \n(Intent-to-Treat Population) (Study Fx-005)\n\nPlacebo\nN=61\n\nVyndaqel\nN=64\n\nP-value Vyndaqel % change \nrelative to Placebo\n\nNIS-LL change from BL\nLSMean (SE)\n\n5.8 (0.96) 2.8 (0.95) 0.027 -52%\n\nLarge Fibre change from BL\nLSMean (SE)\n\n3.2 (0.63) 1.5 (0.62) 0.066 -53%\n\n\n\n7\n\nSecondary Endpoints Changes from Baseline to Month 18 LSMean (Standard Error) \n(Intent-to-Treat Population) (Study Fx-005)\n\nPlacebo\nN=61\n\nVyndaqel\nN=64\n\nP-value Vyndaqel % change \nrelative to Placebo\n\nSmall Fibre change from BL\nLSMean (SE)\n\n1.6 (0.32) 0.3 (0.31) 0.005 -81%\n\nmBMI change from BL\nLSMean (SE)\n\n-33.8 \n(11.8)\n\n39.3 (11.5) < 0.0001 NA\n\nmBMI was derived as the product of serum albumin and Body Mass Index.\nBased on repeated measures analysis of variance with change from baseline as the dependent variable, an unstructured covariance matrix, \ntreatment, month and treatment-by-month as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect in the model.\nNA=not applicable.\n\nIn the open-label extension study, the rate of change in the NIS-LL during the 12 months of treatment \nwas similar to that observed in those patients randomised and treated with tafamidis in the previous \ndouble blind 18 month period.\n\nAlthough data are limited, (one open-label study in 21 patients), taking into account the mechanism of \naction of tafamidis and the results on TTR stabilisation, tafamidis meglumine is expected to be \nbeneficial in patients with stage 1 ATTR-PN due to mutations other than V30M.\n\nThe effects of tafamidis have been assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised 3-arm \nstudy in 441 patients with wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).\nThe primary analysis of pooled tafamidis meglumine (20 mg and 80 mg) versus placebo demonstrated \na significant reduction (p=0.0006) in all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related \nhospitalisations.\n\nA supra-therapeutic, single, 400 mg oral dose of tafamidis solution in healthy volunteers demonstrated \nno prolongation of the QTc interval.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntafamidis in all subsets of the paediatric population in transthyretin amyloidosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become \navailable every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration of the soft capsule once daily, the maximum peak concentration (Cmax) is \nachieved within a median time (tmax) of 4 hours after dosing in the fasted state. Concomitant \nadministration of a high fat, high calorie meal altered the rate of absorption, but not the extent of \nabsorption. These results support the administration of tafamidis with or without food.\n\nDistribution\n\nTafamidis is highly protein bound (> 99%) in plasma. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution \nis 16 litres. \n\nThe extent of tafamidis binding to plasma proteins has been evaluated using animal and human \nplasma. The affinity of tafamidis for TTR is greater than that for albumin. Therefore, in plasma, \ntafamidis is likely to bind preferentially to TTR despite the significantly higher concentration of \nalbumin (600 \u03bcM) relative to TTR (3.6 \u03bcM).\n\n\n\n8\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nThere is no explicit evidence of biliary excretion of tafamidis in humans. Based on preclinical data, it \nis suggested that tafamidis is metabolised by glucuronidation and excreted via the bile. This route of \nbiotransformation is plausible in humans, as approximately 59% of the total administered dose is \nrecovered in faeces, and approximately 22% recovered in urine. Based on population pharmacokinetic \nresults, the apparent oral clearance of tafamidis meglumine is 0.228 L/h and the population mean \nhalf-life is approximately 49 hours.\n\nDose and time linearity\n\nExposure from once-daily dosing with tafamidis meglumine increased with increasing dose up to \n480 mg single dose and multiple doses up to 80 mg/day. In general, increases were proportional or \nnear proportional to dose and tafamidis clearance was stationary over time.\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were similar after single and repeated administration of 20 mg tafamidis \nmeglumine, indicating a lack of induction or inhibition of tafamidis metabolism.\n\nResults of once-daily dosing with 15 mg to 60 mg oral solution tafamidis meglumine for 14 days \ndemonstrated that steady-state was achieved by Day 14. \n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPharmacokinetic data indicated decreased systemic exposure (approximately 40%) and increased total \nclearance (0.52 L/h versus 0.31 L/h) of tafamidis meglumine in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Score of 7-9 inclusive) compared to healthy subjects due to a higher unbound \nfraction of tafamidis. As patients with moderate hepatic impairment have lower TTR levels than \nhealthy subjects, dosage adjustment is not necessary as the stoichiometry of tafamidis with its target \nprotein TTR would be sufficient for stabilisation of the TTR tetramer. The exposure to tafamidis in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTafamidis has not specifically been evaluated in a dedicated study of patients with renal impairment. \nThe influence of creatinine clearance on tafamidis pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients with creatinine clearance greater than 18 mL/min. \nPharmacokinetic estimates indicated no difference in apparent oral clearance of tafamidis in patients \nwith creatinine clearance less than 80 mL/min compared to those with creatinine clearance greater than \nor equal to 80 mL/min. Dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment is considered not \nnecessary.\n\nElderly\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic results, subjects \u2265 65 years had an average 15% lower estimate \nof apparent oral clearance at steady-state compared to subjects less than 65 years old. However, the \ndifference in clearance results in < 20% increases in mean Cmax and AUC compared to younger \nsubjects and is not clinically significant.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\n\nIn vitro data indicated that tafamidis does not significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes \nCYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Tafamidis is \nnot expected to cause clinically relevant drug interaction due to induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or \nCYP3A4.\n\n\n\n9\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that it is unlikely tafamidis will cause drug interactions at clinically relevant \nconcentrations with substrates of UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) systemically. Tafamidis may \ninhibit intestinal activities of UGT1A1.\n\nTafamidis showed a low potential to inhibit Multi-Drug Resistant Protein (MDR1) (also known as \nP-glycoprotein; P-gp) systemically and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, organic cation transporter 2 \n(OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) and MATE2K, organic anion \ntransporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nNonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, fertility and early embryonic development, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. In \nrepeat-dose toxicity and the carcinogenicity studies, the liver appeared as a target organ for toxicity in \nthe different species tested. Liver effects were seen at exposures approximately \u2265 2.5-times the human \nAUC at steady-state at the clinical dose of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine.\n\nIn a developmental toxicity study in rabbits, a slight increase in skeletal malformations and variations, \nabortions in few females, reduced embryo-foetal survival, and reduction in foetal weights were \nobserved at exposures approximately \u2265 7.2 times the human AUC at steady-state at the clinical dose of \n20 mg tafamidis meglumine.\n\nIn the rat pre- and postnatal development study with tafamidis, decreased pup survival and reduced \npup weights were noted following maternal dose administration during pregnancy and lactation at \ndoses of 15 and 30 mg/kg/day. Decreased pup weights in males were associated with delayed sexual \nmaturation (preputial separation) at 15 mg/kg/day. Impaired performance in a water-maze test for \nlearning and memory was observed at 15 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the F1 \ngeneration offspring following maternal dose administration during pregnancy and lactation with \ntafamidis was 5 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose = 0.8 mg/kg/day), a dose approximately 4.6 times \nthe clinical dose of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nVyndaqel 61 mg soft capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach soft capsule contains 61 mg of micronized tafamidis.\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach soft capsule contains no more than 44 mg of sorbitol (E 420).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSoft capsule.\n\nReddish brown, opaque, oblong (approximately 21 mm) capsule printed with \u201cVYN 61\u201d in white.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nVyndaqel is indicated for the treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult \npatients with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician knowledgeable in the management \nof patients with amyloidosis or cardiomyopathy.\n\nWhen there is a suspicion in patients presenting with specific medical history or signs of heart failure \nor cardiomyopathy, etiologic diagnosis must be done by a physician knowledgeable in the \nmanagement of amyloidosis or cardiomyopathy to confirm ATTR-CM and exclude AL amyloidosis \nbefore starting tafamidis, using appropriate assessment tools such as: bone scintigraphy and \nblood/urine assessment, and/or histological assessment by biopsy, and transthyretin (TTR) genotyping \nto characterise as wild-type or hereditary.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule of Vyndaqel 61 mg (tafamidis) orally once daily (see section \n5.1).\n\nVyndaqel 61 mg (tafamidis) corresponds to 80 mg tafamidis meglumine. Tafamidis and tafamidis \nmeglumine are not interchangeable on a per mg basis (see section 5.2).\n\nVyndaqel should be started as early as possible in the disease course when the clinical benefit on \ndisease progression could be more evident. Conversely, when amyloid-related cardiac damage is more \nadvanced, such as in NYHA Class III, the decision to start or maintain treatment should be taken at the \n\n\n\n13\n\ndiscretion of a physician knowledgeable in the management of patients with amyloidosis or \ncardiomyopathy (see section 5.1). There are limited clinical data in patients with NYHA Class IV.\n\nIf vomiting occurs after dosing, and the intact Vyndaqel capsule is identified, then an additional dose \nof Vyndaqel should be administered if possible. If no capsule is identified, then no additional dose is \nnecessary, with resumption of dosing the next day as usual.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic and renal impairment\n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal or mild and moderate hepatic impairment. \nLimited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or \nequal to 30 mL/min). Tafamidis has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and \ncaution is recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of tafamidis in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\n\nThe soft capsules should be swallowed whole and not crushed or cut. Vyndaqel may be taken with or \nwithout food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use appropriate contraception when taking tafamidis and \ncontinue to use appropriate contraception for 1-month after stopping treatment with tafamidis (see \nsection 4.6).\n\nTafamidis should be added to the standard of care for the treatment of patients with transthyretin \namyloidosis. Physicians should monitor patients and continue to assess the need for other therapy, \nincluding the need for organ transplantation, as part of this standard of care. As there are no data \navailable regarding the use of tafamidis in organ transplantation, tafamidis should be discontinued in \npatients who undergo organ transplantation.\n\nIncrease in liver function tests and decrease in thyroxine may occur (see section 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nThis medicinal product contains no more than 44 mg sorbitol in each capsule.\n\nThe additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. \n\nThe content of sorbitol in medicinal products for oral use may affect the bioavailability of other \nmedicinal products for oral use administered concomitantly.\n\n\n\n14\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nIn a clinical study in healthy volunteers, 20 mg tafamidis meglumine did not induce or inhibit the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.\n\nIn vitro tafamidis inhibits the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) at the \n61 mg/day tafamidis dose with IC50=1.16 \u00b5M and may cause drug-drug interactions at clinically \nrelevant concentrations with substrates of this transporter (e.g. methotrexate, rosuvastatin, imatinib) \nfollowing a 61 mg/day tafamidis dose. Likewise, tafamidis inhibits the uptake transporters OAT1 and \nOAT3 (organic anion transporters) with IC50=2.9 \u00b5M and IC50=2.36 \u00b5M, respectively, and may \ncause drug-drug interactions at clinically relevant concentrations with substrates of these transporters \n(e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bumetanide, furosemide, lamivudine, methotrexate, \noseltamivir, tenofovir, ganciclovir, adefovir, cidofovir, zidovudine, zalcitabine). Based on in vitro data, \nthe maximal predicted changes in AUC of OAT1 and OAT3 substrates were determined to be less than \n1.25 for the tafamidis 61 mg dose, therefore, inhibition of OAT1 or OAT3 transporters by tafamidis is \nnot expected to result in clinically significant interactions.\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed evaluating the effect of other medicinal products on \ntafamidis.\n\nLaboratory test abnormality\n\nTafamidis may decrease serum concentrations of total thyroxine, without an accompanying change in \nfree thyroxine (T4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This observation in total thyroxine values \nmay likely be the result of reduced thyroxine binding to or displacement from TTR due to the high \nbinding affinity tafamidis has to the TTR thyroxine receptor. No corresponding clinical findings \nconsistent with thyroid dysfunction have been observed.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nContraceptive measures should be used by women of childbearing potential during treatment with \ntafamidis, and for one month after stopping treatment, due to the prolonged half-life.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data on the use of tafamidis in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \ndevelopmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Tafamidis is not recommended during pregnancy and in \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nAvailable data in animals have shown excretion of tafamidis in milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Tafamidis should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nNo impairment of fertility has been observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, tafamidis is believed to have no or \nnegligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.\n\n\n\n15\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety data reflect exposure of 176 patients with ATTR-CM to 80 mg (administered as 4 x 20 mg) \nof tafamidis meglumine administered daily in a 30-month placebo-controlled trial in patients \ndiagnosed with ATTR-CM (see section 5.1). \n\nThe frequency of adverse events in patients treated with 80 mg tafamidis meglumine was generally\nsimilar and comparable to placebo.\n\nThe following adverse events were reported more often in patients treated with tafamidis meglumine \n80 mg compared to placebo: flatulence [8 patients (4.5%) versus 3 patients (1.7%)] and liver function \ntest increased [6 patients (3.4%) versus 2 patients (1.1%)]. A causal relationship has not been \nestablished.\n\nSafety data for tafamidis 61 mg are not available as this formulation was not evaluated in the \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 3 study.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere is minimal clinical experience with overdose. During clinical trials, two patients diagnosed with \nATTR-CM accidentally ingested a single tafamidis meglumine dose of 160 mg without the occurrence \nof any associated adverse events. The highest dose of tafamidis meglumine given to healthy volunteers \nin a clinical trial was 480 mg as a single dose. There was one reported treatment-related adverse event \nof mild hordeolum at this dose.\n\nManagement\n\nIn case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGIC PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX08\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTafamidis is a selective stabiliser of TTR. Tafamidis binds to TTR at the thyroxine binding sites, \nstabilising the tetramer and slowing dissociation into monomers, the rate-limiting step in the \namyloidogenic process.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nTransthyretin amyloidosis is a severely debilitating condition induced by the accumulation of various \ninsoluble fibrillar proteins, or amyloid, within the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\nfunction. The dissociation of the transthyretin tetramer to monomers is the rate-limiting step in the \npathogenesis of transthyretin amyloidosis. The folded monomers undergo partial denaturation to \nproduce alternatively folded monomeric amyloidogenic intermediates. These intermediates then \nmisassemble into soluble oligomers, profilaments, filaments, and amyloid fibrils. Tafamidis binds with \nnegative cooperativity to the two thyroxine binding sites on the native tetrameric form of transthyretin \npreventing dissociation into monomers. The inhibition of TTR tetramer dissociation forms the \nrationale for the use of tafamidis in ATTR-CM patients.\n\nA TTR stabilisation assay was utilised as a pharmacodynamic marker, and assessed the stability of the \nTTR tetramer. \n\nTafamidis stabilised both the wild-type TTR tetramer and the tetramers of 14 TTR variants tested \nclinically after once-daily dosing with tafamidis. Tafamidis also stabilised the TTR tetramer for \n25 variants tested ex vivo, thus demonstrating TTR stabilisation of 40 amyloidogenic TTR genotypes. \n\nIn a multicentre, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study (see Clinical \nefficacy and safety section), TTR stabilisation was observed at Month 1 and was maintained through \nMonth 30. \n\nBiomarkers associated with heart failure (NT-proBNP and Troponin I) favoured Vyndaqel over \nplacebo. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nEfficacy was demonstrated in a multicentre, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nrandomised 3-arm study in 441 patients with wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM. \n\nPatients were randomised to either tafamidis meglumine 20 mg (n=88) or 80 mg [administered as \nfour 20 mg tafamidis meglumine capsules] (n=176) or matching placebo (n=177) once daily, in \naddition to standard of care (e.g. diuretics) for 30 months. Treatment assignment was stratified by the \npresence or absence of a variant TTR genotype as well as by baseline severity of disease (NYHA \nClass). Table 1 describes the patient demographics and baseline characteristics.\n\nTable 1: Patient demographics and baseline characteristics\n\nCharacteristic Pooled Tafamidis\nN=264\n\nPlacebo\nN=177\n\nAge \u2014 year\nMean (standard deviation) 74.5 (7.2) 74.1 (6.7)\nMedian (minimum, maximum) 75 (46, 88) 74 (51, 89)\n\nSex \u2014 number (%)\nMale 241 (91.3) 157 (88.7)\nFemale 23 (8.7) 20 (11.3)\n\nTTR genotype \u2014 number (%)\nATTRm 63 (23.9) 43 (24.3)\nATTRwt 201 (76.1) 134 (75.7)\n\nNYHA Class \u2014 number (%)\nNYHA Class I 24 (9.1) 13 (7.3)\nNYHA Class II 162 (61.4) 101 (57.1)\nNYHA Class III 78 (29.5) 63 (35.6)\n\nAbbreviations: ATTRm=variant transthyretin amyloid, ATTRwt=wild-type transthyretin amyloid, NYHA=New York Heart Association.\n\nThe primary analysis used a hierarchical combination applying the method of Finkelstein-Schoenfeld \n(F-S) to all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalisations, which is defined \nas the number of times a subject is hospitalised (i.e., admitted to a hospital) for cardiovascular-related \nmorbidity. The method compared each patient to every other patient within each stratum in a pair-wise \n\n\n\n17\n\nmanner that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion using all-cause mortality followed by frequency of \ncardiovascular-related hospitalisations when patients cannot be differentiated based on mortality. \n\nThis analysis demonstrated a significant reduction (p=0.0006) in all-cause mortality and frequency of \ncardiovascular-related hospitalisations in the pooled tafamidis 20 mg and 80 mg dose group versus \nplacebo (Table 2). \n\nTable 2: Primary analysis using Finkelstein-Schoenfeld (F-S) Method of all-cause mortality and \nfrequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalisations\n\nPrimary analysis Pooled Tafamidis\nN=264\n\nPlacebo\nN=177\n\nNumber (%) of subjects alive* at month 30 186 (70.5) 101 (57.1)\nAverage cardiovascular-related hospitalisations during \n30 months (per patient per year) among those alive at \nmonth 30\u2020\n\n0.297 0.455\n\np-value from F-S Method 0.0006\n* Heart transplantation and cardiac mechanical assist device implantation are considered indicators of approaching end stage.

Analyses of \n6MWT and KCCQ-OS also favoured tafamidis relative to placebo within each subgroup.\n\nFigure 2: Results from F-S Method and components by subgroup and dose \n\nAbbreviations: ATTRm=variant transthyretin amyloid, ATTRwt=wild type transthyretin amyloid, F-S=Finkelstein-Schoenfeld, \nCI=Confidence Interval.\n* F-S results presented using win ratio (based on all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular hospitalisation). The Win ratio is the \nnumber of pairs of treated-patient \u201cwins\u201d divided by number of pairs of placebo patient \u201cwins.\u201d\nHeart transplants and cardiac mechanical assist devices treated as death.\n\nIn applying the F-S method to each dose group individually, tafamidis reduced the combination of \nall-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalisations for both the 80 mg and \n20 mg doses compared to placebo (p=0.0030 and p=0.0048, respectively). Results of the primary \nanalysis, 6MWT at Month 30 and KCCQ-OS at Month 30 were statistically significant for both the \ntafamidis meglumine 80 mg and 20 mg doses versus placebo, with similar results for both doses.\n\nEfficacy data for tafamidis 61 mg are not available as this formulation was not evaluated in the \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 3 study. The relative bioavailability of tafamidis \n61 mg is similar to tafamidis meglumine 80 mg at steady-state (see section 5.2).\n\nA supra-therapeutic, single, 400 mg oral dose of tafamidis meglumine solution in healthy volunteers \ndemonstrated no prolongation of the QTc interval.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with\ntafamidis in all subsets of the paediatric population in transthyretin amyloidosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n\n\n20\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration of the soft capsule once daily, the maximum peak concentration (Cmax) is \nachieved within a median time (tmax) of 4 hours for tafamidis 61 mg and 2 hours for tafamidis \nmeglumine 80 mg (4 x 20 mg) after dosing in the fasted state. Concomitant administration of a high \nfat, high calorie meal altered the rate of absorption, but not the extent of absorption. These results \nsupport the administration of tafamidis with or without food.\n\nDistribution\n\nTafamidis is highly protein bound (> 99%) in plasma. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution \nis 18.5 litres. \n\nThe extent of tafamidis binding to plasma proteins has been evaluated using animal and human \nplasma. The affinity of tafamidis for TTR is greater than that for albumin. Therefore, in plasma, \ntafamidis is likely to bind preferentially to TTR despite the significantly higher concentration of \nalbumin (600 \u03bcM) relative to TTR (3.6 \u03bcM).\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nThere is no explicit evidence of biliary excretion of tafamidis in humans. Based on preclinical data, it \nis suggested that tafamidis is metabolised by glucuronidation and excreted via the bile. This route of \nbiotransformation is plausible in humans, as approximately 59% of the total administered dose is \nrecovered in faeces, and approximately 22% recovered in urine. Based on population pharmacokinetic \nresults, the apparent oral clearance of tafamidis is 0.263 L/h and the population mean half-life is \napproximately 49 hours.\n\nDose and time linearity\n\nExposure from once-daily dosing with tafamidis meglumine increased with increasing dose up to \n480 mg single dose and multiple doses up to 80 mg/day. In general, increases were proportional or \nnear proportional to dose and tafamidis clearance was stationary over time.\n\nThe relative bioavailability of tafamidis 61 mg is similar to tafamidis meglumine 80 mg at \nsteady-state. Tafamidis and tafamidis meglumine are not interchangeable on a per mg basis.\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were similar after single and repeated administration of 20 mg dose of \ntafamidis meglumine, indicating a lack of induction or inhibition of tafamidis metabolism.\n\nResults of once-daily dosing with 15 mg to 60 mg oral solution tafamidis meglumine for 14 days \ndemonstrated that steady-state was achieved by Day 14.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPharmacokinetic data indicated decreased systemic exposure (approximately 40%) and increased total \nclearance (0.52 L/h versus 0.31 L/h) of tafamidis meglumine in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Score of 7-9 inclusive) compared to healthy subjects due to a higher unbound \nfraction of tafamidis. As patients with moderate hepatic impairment have lower TTR levels than \nhealthy subjects, dosage adjustment is not necessary as the stoichiometry of tafamidis with its target \nprotein TTR would be sufficient for stabilisation of the TTR tetramer. The exposure to tafamidis in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown.\n\n\n\n21\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTafamidis has not specifically been evaluated in a dedicated study of patients with renal impairment. \nThe influence of creatinine clearance on tafamidis pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients with creatinine clearance greater than 18 mL/min. \nPharmacokinetic estimates indicated no difference in apparent oral clearance of tafamidis in patients \nwith creatinine clearance less than 80 mL/min compared to those with creatinine clearance greater than \nor equal to 80 mL/min. Dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment is considered not \nnecessary.\n\nElderly\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic results, subjects \u2265 65 years had an average 15% lower estimate \nof apparent oral clearance at steady-state compared to subjects less than 65 years old. However, the \ndifference in clearance results in < 20% increases in mean Cmax and AUC compared to younger \nsubjects and is not clinically significant.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\n\nIn vitro data indicated that tafamidis does not significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes \nCYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Tafamidis is \nnot expected to cause clinically relevant drug interaction due to induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or \nCYP3A4.\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that it is unlikely tafamidis will cause drug interactions at clinically relevant \nconcentrations with substrates of UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) systemically. Tafamidis may \ninhibit intestinal activities of UGT1A1.\n\nTafamidis showed a low potential to inhibit Multi-Drug Resistant Protein (MDR1) (also known as \nP-glycoprotein; P-gp) systemically and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, organic cation transporter 2 \n(OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) and MATE2K, organic anion \ntransporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nNonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, fertility and early embryonic development, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. In \nrepeat-dose toxicity and the carcinogenicity studies, the liver appeared as a target organ for toxicity in \nthe different species tested. Liver effects were seen at exposures approximately equal to the human \nAUC at steady-state at the clinical dose of 61 mg tafamidis.\n\nIn a developmental toxicity study in rabbits, a slight increase in skeletal malformations and variations, \nabortions in few females, reduced embryo-foetal survival, and reduction in foetal weights were \nobserved at exposures approximately \u2265 2.1 times the human AUC at steady-state at the clinical dose of \n61 mg tafamidis.\n\nIn the rat pre- and postnatal development study with tafamidis, decreased pup survival and reduced \npup weights were noted following maternal dose administration during pregnancy and lactation at \ndoses of 15 and 30 mg/kg/day. Decreased pup weights in males were associated with delayed sexual \nmaturation (preputial separation) at 15 mg/kg/day. Impaired performance in a water-maze test for \nlearning and memory was observed at 15 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the F1 \ngeneration offspring following maternal dose administration during pregnancy and lactation with \ntafamidis was 5 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose of tafamidis = 0.8 mg/kg/day), a dose \napproximately equal to the clinical dose of 61 mg tafamidis.\n\n\n\n22\n\n6.

What Vyndaqel is and what it is used for\n\nVyndaqel contains the active substance tafamidis.\n\nVyndaqel is a medicine which treats a disease called transthyretin amyloidosis Transthyretin \namyloidosis is caused by a protein called transthyretin (TTR) that does not work properly. TTR is a \nprotein that carries other substances, such as hormones, through the body.\n\nIn patients with this disease, TTR breaks up and may form fibres called amyloid. Amyloid can build \nup around your nerves (known as transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy or ATTR-PN) and in other \nplaces in your body. The amyloid causes the symptoms of this disease. When this occurs, it prevents\nthem from working normally. \n\nVyndaqel, can prevent TTR from breaking up and forming amyloid. This medicine is used to treat \nadult patients with this disease whose nerves have been affected (people with symptomatic\npolyneuropathy) to delay further progression.\n\n2.

There are no \ndata on the use of Vyndaqel in pregnant women.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nChildren and adolescents do not have the symptoms of transthyretin amyloidosis.

What Vyndaqel is and what it is used for\n\nVyndaqel contains the active substance tafamidis.\n\nVyndaqel is a medicine which treats a disease called transthyretin amyloidosis. Transthyretin \namyloidosis is caused by a protein called transthyretin (TTR) that does not work properly. TTR is a \nprotein that carries other substances, such as hormones, through the body.\n\nIn patients with this disease, TTR breaks up and may form fibres called amyloid. Amyloid can build \nup between cells in your heart (known as transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy or ATTR-CM) and in \nother places in your body. The amyloid causes the symptoms of this disease. When this occurs in your \nheart, it prevents your heart from working normally.\n\nVyndaqel, can prevent TTR from breaking up and forming amyloid. This medicine is used to treat \nadult patients whose heart has been affected (people with symptomatic cardiomyopathy).\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Vyndaqel\n\nDo not take Vyndaqel\n\nIf you are allergic to tafamidis or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vyndaqel.\n\n\n\n51\n\n\uf0b7 Women that can become pregnant should use birth control while taking Vyndaqel and should \ncontinue using birth control for one month after stopping treatment with Vyndaqel. There are no \ndata on the use of Vyndaqel in pregnant women.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nChildren and adolescents do not have the symptoms of transthyretin amyloidosis. Vyndaqel is \ntherefore not used for children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Vyndaqel\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nYou should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:\n\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n- diuretic medicines (e.g. furosemide, bumetanide) \n- anti-cancer medicines (e.g. methotrexate, imatinib)\n- statins (e.g. rosuvastatin)\n- anti-viral medicines (e.g. oseltamivir, tenofovir, ganciclovir, adefovir, cidofovir, lamivudine, \n\nzidovudine, zalcitabine)\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\n\uf0b7 You should not take Vyndaqel if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\uf0b7 If you are able to become pregnant, you must use birth control during treatment and for \n\none month after stopping treatment.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nVyndaqel is believed to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nVyndaqel contains sorbitol\n\nThis medicine contains no more than 44 mg sorbitol in each capsule.\n\n3. How to take Vyndaqel\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose is one Vyndaqel 61 mg (tafamidis) capsule taken once a day.\n\nIf you vomit after taking this medicine and can identify the intact Vyndaqel capsule, then an additional \ndose of Vyndaqel should be taken in the same day; if you cannot identify the Vyndaqel capsule, then \nno additional dose of Vyndaqel is necessary, and you can resume taking Vyndaqel the next day as \nusual.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nVyndaqel is for oral use.\nThe soft capsule should be swallowed whole, not crushed or cut.\n\n\n\n52\n\nThe capsule may be taken with or without food.\n\nInstructions for opening the blisters\n\n\uf0b7 Tear off one individual blister from the blister card along the perforated line.\n\uf0b7 Peel back the paper at the curved arrow to expose the aluminium foil.\n\uf0b7 Push capsule through the exposed aluminium foil.\n\nIf you take more Vyndaqel than you should\n\nYou should not take more capsules than your doctor tells you to. If you take more capsules than you \nhave been told to take, contact your doctor.\n\nIf you forget to take Vyndaqel\n\nIf you forget to take a dose, take your capsules as soon as you remember. If it is within 6 hours before\nyour next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Vyndaqel\n\nDo not stop taking Vyndaqel without first speaking to your doctor. As Vyndaqel works by stabilising \nthe TTR protein, if you stop taking Vyndaqel, the protein will no longer be stabilised, and your disease \nmay progress.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nIn clinical studies, the side effects in patients taking Vyndaqel were generally similar to that of patients \nnot taking Vyndaqel. Flatulence and increase in liver function tests were reported more often in \nATTR-CM patients treated with Vyndaqel.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Vyndaqel\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister card and on the carton. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n53\n\n6.
