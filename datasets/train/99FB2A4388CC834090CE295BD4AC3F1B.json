NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\nDiacomit 250 mg hard capsules \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach capsule contains 250 mg of stiripentol. \n\nExcipient with known effect  \n\n0.16 mg sodium per capsule. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule \n\nSize 2, pink capsule, imprinted with \u201cDiacomit 250 mg\u201d. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDiacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of \nrefractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n(SMEI, Dravet\u2019s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and \nvalproate. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist \nexperienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  \n\nPosology \n\nPaediatric population\nThe dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. \n\nThe daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. \n\nThe initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards \ndose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with \nclobazam and valproate.  \n\nStiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then \n30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: \n- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; \n- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; \n- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week \nuntil the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. \n\n\n\n3\n\nThe recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the \nonly dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). \n\nStiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. \nexposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). \nStiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), \ncarbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. \n\nChildren aged less than 3 years \nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \nThe clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be \nmade on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. \nIn this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should only be started when the \ndiagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of \nstiripentolunder 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the \nclose supervision of the doctor. \n\nPatients aged \u2265 18 years of age \nLong-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of \neffect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. \n\nDose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol \nDespite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the \nfollowing advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic \nmedicinal products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical \nexperience. \n\n- Clobazam \nIn the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was \n0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of \nadverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young \nchildren), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases \nin clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported \nwith co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet\u2019s syndrome. \n\n- Valproate \nThe potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and \nthus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for \nclinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as \nloss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. \n\nAbnormal laboratory findings \nIn the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for \ncontinuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam \nand valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential \nclinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). \n\nEffect of formulation \nThe sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not \nbioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under \nclinical supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nStiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n4\n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use \nThe capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  \nThe capsules should not be chewed. \nFor the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nA past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCarbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital \n\nThese substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of \nside effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). \n\nGrowth rate of children \n\nGiven the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate \n(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of \ntreatment should be carefully monitored. \n\nBlood count\n\nNeutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood \ncounts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically \nindicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. \n\nLiver function \n\nIt should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, \nliver function should be checked every 6 months. \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nIn the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol \nis not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). \n\nSubstances interfering with CYP enzymes\n\nStiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly \nincrease the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk \nof adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is \ncatalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when \ncombining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is \nrecommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on \nstiripentol therapy. \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol \n\nThe influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well \nestablished. \nThe impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal agents on stiripentol metabolism, that are \nknown to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the \neffect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. \n\nIn vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other \nsubstances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nEffect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes \n\nMany of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The \nincrease in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar \nin adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. \n\nAt therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for \nexample, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic \norigin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic \nlevels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase \nin adverse reactions. \n\nCaution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, \nantihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, oral \ncontraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section for \nantiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is recommended. \nA dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to \nthe markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  \n\nData on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with \ntheophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of the increased plasma levels of theophylline \nand caffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to \ntoxicity. Use in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted \nto medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods and nutritional products aimed at \nchildren: Patient should not drink cola drinks, which contain significant quantities of caffeine or \nchocolate, which contains trace amounts of theophylline (see section 4.2). \n\nAs stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, \nsubstances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, \ntimolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), \nantipsychotics (haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to \nmetabolic interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. \n\nPotential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products \n\nIn the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant \ninteractions with stiripentol: \n\n\n\n6\n\nUndesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) \n- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) \nErgotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). \n\n- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil \nIncreased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. \n\n- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) \nRaised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). \n\n- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) \nIncreased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic \nmetabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). \n\nCombinations requiring precautions \n\n- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam \nIncreased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to \nexcessive sedation. \n\n- Chlorpromazine \nStiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. \n\n- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) \nInhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions \n(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nclobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), \nethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants \nwith potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when \ncombined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. \n\n- Topiramate \nIn a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam \nand valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there \nis no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-\nadministered with stiripentol. \nWith regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 \nshould not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma \nconcentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. \n\n- Levetiracetam \nLevetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no \npharmacokinetic metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other \nfactors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large \nextent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been \nnoted with polytherapy. \nHowever, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the \naggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n\n\n\n7\n\nRisk related to stiripentol \nNo data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect \nharmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at \nnon-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical \ndecision for use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into \nconsideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nto pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIn the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely \nfrom plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case \nstiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully \nobserved for potential adverse effects. \n\nFertility \n\nNo impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, \npotential risk for human is unknown. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nsome patients may experience dizziness and ataxiathat may affect ability to drive and use machines \nand patients should not drive or use machinery whilst on stiripentol therapy. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, \nataxia, hypotonia and dystonia.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing severity. \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n(MedDRA \nterminology)\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nNeutropenia  Thrombocytopenia \n* \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\nAnorexia, loss of \nappetite, weight \nloss \n\n\n\n8\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Aggressiveness, \nirritability, behaviour \ndisorders, opposing \nbehaviour, \nhyperexcitability, \nsleep disorders \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDrowsiness, \nataxia, \nhypotonia, \ndystonia\n\nHyperkinesias \n\nEye disorders Diplopia \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, vomiting \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nPhotosensitivity, \nrash, cutaneous \nallergy, urticaria\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n\nInvestigations Raised \u03b3-GT  Liver function test \nabnormal\n\n* Thrombocytopenia data are derived from both clinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nMany of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other \nanticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these \nmedicinal products is reduced. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nData on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in \nintensive care units). \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 \n\nMechanism of action \nIn animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and \nbicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid \n(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition \nof synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been \nshown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nincrease the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a \nbarbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as \ncarbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result \nof pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic \ninhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic \nmetabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \n\nA French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis \nof Dravet\u2019s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision \nfor use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual \npatient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). \n\n41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a \nbaseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam \nduring a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. \nResponders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-\nclonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. \n15 (71%) patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic \nseizures), whereas there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI \n52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change \nfrom baseline was higher on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p< 0.0001. 21 patients on \nstiripentol had moderate side-effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, \nbut side-effects disappeared when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases \n(Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  \n\nThere are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses \ngreater than 50 mg/kg/day. There are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as \nmonotherapy in Dravet\u2019s syndrome. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult \nhealthy volunteers and adult patients. \n\nAbsorption \n\nStiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available \nfor testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. \n\nRelative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations \nhas been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two \nformulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was \nslightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax\nwas similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the \nstiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. \n\nDistribution \n\nStiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). \n\n\n\n10\n\nElimination \n\nSystemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma \nclearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of \n600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated \nadministration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nresponsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, \nincreasing with dose. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nStiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main \nmetabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the \nenzymes involved has not yet been achieved. \nOn the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 \nmetabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. \n\nExcretion \n\nMost stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. \nUrinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose \nwhereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. \n\nPaediatric population pharmacokinetic study \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with \nstiripentol and two substances not known to affect stiripentol pharmacokinetics, valproate and \nclobazam. The median age was 7.3 years (range: 1 to 17.6 years) and the median daily dose of \nstiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. \n\nThe data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination \nprocesses. The population estimate for the absorption rate constant Ka was 2.08 hr-1 (standard \ndeviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body \nweight by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased \nfrom 10 to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of \ndistribution increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for \n10 kg) to 23.5 hr (for 60 kg). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nToxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity \napart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high \ndoses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and non-rodents. This finding is considered to \nbe an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  \nStiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in \nseveral other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic \ndose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of \nGood Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive \nperformance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in \nthe survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of \n800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  \nCarcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase \nin the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day \nfor 78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol \nand the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of \n\n\n\n11\n\nhepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in \npatients. \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDiacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of \nrefractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n(SMEI, Dravet\u2019s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and \nvalproate. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist \nexperienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  \n\nPosology \n\nThe dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. \n\nThe daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. \n\nThe initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards \ndose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with \nclobazam and valproate.  \n\nStiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then \n30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: \n- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; \n- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; \n- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week \nuntil the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. \n\nThe recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the \nonly dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n14\n\nStiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. \nexposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). \nStiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), \ncarbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. \n\nChildren aged less than 3 years \nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \nThe clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be \nmade on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. \nIn this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should only be started when the \ndiagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of \nstiripentol under 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the \nclose supervision of the doctor. \n\nPatients aged \u2265 18 years of age \nLong-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of \neffect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. \n\nDose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol \n\nDespite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the \nfollowing advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic \nmedicinal products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical \nexperience. \n\n- Clobazam \nIn the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was \n0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of \nadverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young \nchildren), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases \nin clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported \nwith co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet\u2019s syndrome. \n\n- Valproate \nThe potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and \nthus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for \nclinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as \nloss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. \n\nAbnormal laboratory findings \nIn the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for \ncontinuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam \nand valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential \nclinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). \n\nEffect of formulation \nThe sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not \nbioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under \nclinical supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nStiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nMethod of administration \n\n\n\n15\n\nOral use \nThe capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. \nThe capsules should not be chewed. \nFor the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nA past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCarbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital \n\nThese substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of \nside effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). \n\nGrowth rate of children \n\nGiven the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate \n(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of \ntreatment should be carefully monitored. \n\nBlood count\n\nNeutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood \ncounts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically \nindicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. \n\nLiver function \n\nIt should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, \nliver function should be checked every 6 months. \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nIn the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, Stiripentol \nis not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). \n\nSubstances interfering with CYP enzymes\n\nStiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly \nincrease the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk \nof adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is \ncatalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when \ncombining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is \nrecommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on \nstiripentol therapy. \n\n\n\n16\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol \n\nThe influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well \nestablished. \nThe impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal products on stiripentol metabolism, that are \nknown to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the \neffect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. \n\nIn vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other \nsubstances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nEffect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes \n\nMany of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The \nincrease in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar \nin adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. \n\nAt therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for \nexample, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic \norigin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic \nlevels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase \nin adverse reactions. \nCaution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, \nantihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, oral \ncontraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section for \nantiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is recommended. \nA dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to \nthe markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  \n\nData on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with \ntheophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of increased plasma levels of theophylline and \ncaffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. \nUse in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to \nmedicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods and nutritional products aimed at \nchildren: Patient should not drink cola drinks, which contain significant quantities of caffeine or \nchocolate, which contains trace amounts of theophylline (see section 4.2). \n\nAs stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, \nsubstances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, \ntimolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), \nantipsychotics (haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to \nmetabolic interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. \n\nPotential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products \n\nIn the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant \ninteractions with stiripentol: \n\n\n\n17\n\nUndesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) \n- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) \nErgotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). \n\n- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil \nIncreased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. \n\n- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) \nRaised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). \n\n- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) \nIncreased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic \nmetabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). \n\nCombinations requiring precautions \n\n- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam \nIncreased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to \nexcessive sedation. \n\n- Chlorpromazine \nStiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. \n\n- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) \nInhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions \n(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nclobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), \nethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants \nwith potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when \ncombined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. \n\n- Topiramate \nIn a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam \nand valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there \nis no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-\nadministered with stiripentol. \nWith regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 \nshould not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma \nconcentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. \n\n- Levetiracetam \nLevetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no \npharmacokinetic metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other \nfactors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large \nextent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been \nnoted with polytherapy. \nHowever, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the \naggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n\n\n\n18\n\nRisk related to stiripentol \nNo data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect \nharmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at \nnon-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical \ndecision for use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into \nconsideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nto pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIn the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk and given that stiripentol passes freely \nfrom plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case \nstiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully \nobserved for potential adverse effects. \n\nFertility \n\nNo impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, \npotential risk for human is unknown. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nsome patients may experience dizziness and ataxia that may affect ability to drive and use machines \nand patients should not drive or use machinery whilst on stiripentol therapy. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, \nataxia, hypotonia and dystonia. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reaction \n\nAdverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing severity. \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n(MedDRA \nterminology)\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nNeutropenia  Thrombocytopenia *\n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\nAnorexia, loss \nof appetite, \nweight loss \n\n\n\n19\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Aggressiveness, \nirritability, behaviour \ndisorders, opposing \nbehaviour, \nhyperexcitability, \nsleep disorders \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDrowsiness, \nataxia, \nhypotonia, \ndystonia\n\nHyperkinesias \n\nEye disorders Diplopia \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, vomiting \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nPhotosensitivity, \nrash, cutaneous \nallergy, urticaria\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n\nInvestigations Raised \u03b3GT  Liver function test \nabnormal\n\n* Thrombocytopenia data are derived from both clinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nMany of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other \nanticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these \nmedicinal products is reduced. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nData on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in \nintensive care units). \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIn animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and \nbicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid \n(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition \nof synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\nshown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and \nincrease the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a \nbarbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as \ncarbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result \nof pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic \ninhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic \nmetabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \n\nA French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis \nof Dravet\u2019s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision \nfor use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual \npatient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). \n\n41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a \nbaseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam \nduring a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. \nResponders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-\nclonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. \n15 (71%) patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic \nseizures), whereas there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI \n52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change \nfrom baseline was higher on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on \nstiripentol had moderate side-effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, \nbut side-effects disappeared when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases \n(Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  \n\nThere are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses \ngreater than 50 mg/kg/day.  \nThere are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as monotherapy in Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult \nhealthy volunteers and adult patients. \n\nAbsorption \n\nStiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available \nfor testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. \n\nRelative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations \nhas been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two \nformulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was \nslightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax\nwas similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the \nstiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. \n\nDistribution \n\nStiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). \n\n\n\n21\n\nElimination \n\nSystemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma \nclearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of \n600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated \nadministration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nresponsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, \nincreasing with dose. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nStiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main \nmetabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the \nenzymes involved has not yet been achieved. \nOn the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 \nmetabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. \n\nExcretion \n\nMost stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. \nUrinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose \nwhereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. \n\nPaediatric population pharmacokinetic study \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with \nstiripentol and two substances not known to affect stiripentol pharmacokinetics, valproate and \nclobazam. The median age was 7.3 years (range: 1 to 17.6 years) and the median daily dose of \nstiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. \n\nThe data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination \nprocesses. The population estimate for the absorption rate constant Ka was 2.08 hr-1 (standard \ndeviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body \nweight by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased \nfrom 10 to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of \ndistribution increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for \n10 kg) to 23.5 hr (for 60 kg). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nToxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity \napart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high \ndoses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and nonrodents. This finding is considered to \nbe an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  \nStiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in \nseveral other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic \ndose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of \nGood Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive \nperformance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in \nthe survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of \n800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  \nCarcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase \nin the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day \nfor 78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol \nand the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of \n\n\n\n22\n\nhepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in \npatients. \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nDiacomit 250 mg powder for oral suspension in sachet \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach sachet contains 250 mg of stiripentol. \n\nExcipient with known effect  \n\n0.11 mg sodium per sachet. \nEach sachet contains 2.5 mg of aspartame, 500 mg of glucose liquid spray and 2.4 mg of sorbitol. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for oral suspension \nPale pink crystalline powder\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDiacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of \nrefractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n(SMEI, Dravet\u2019s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and \nvalproate. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist \nexperienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  \n\nPosology \n\nThe dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. \n\nThe daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. \n\nThe initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards \ndose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with \nclobazam and valproate.  \n\nStiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then \n30mg/kg/day for 1 week. Further dosage escalation is age dependent: \n- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; \n- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; \n- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week \nuntil the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. \n\n\n\n25\n\nThe recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the \nonly dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). \n\nStiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. \nexposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). \nStiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), \ncarbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline \n\nChildren aged less than 3 years \nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \nThe clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be \nmade on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. \nIn this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with Diacomit should only be started when the \ndiagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of \nstiripentol under 12 months of age. For these children the use of stiripentol will be done under the \nclose supervision of the doctor. \n\nPatients aged \u2265 18 years of age \nLong-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of \neffect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. \n\nDose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol \n\nDespite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the \nfollowing advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic \nmedicinal products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical \nexperience. \n\n- Clobazam \nIn the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was \n0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of \nadverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young \nchildren), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases \nin clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported \nwith co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet\u2019s syndrome. \n\n- Valproate \nThe potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and \nthus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for \nclinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as \nloss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. \n\nAbnormal laboratory findings \nIn the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for \ncontinuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam \nand valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential \nclinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4).\n\nEffect of formulation \nThe sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not \nbioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under \nclinical supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nStiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n26\n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use \nThe powder should be mixed in a glass of water and should be taken immediately after mixing. \nFor the interaction of stiripentol with food, please see section 4.5. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nA past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCarbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital \n\nThese substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of \nside effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). \n\nGrowth rate of children \n\nGiven the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate \n(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of \ntreatment should be carefully monitored. \n\nBlood count \n\nNeutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood \ncounts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically \nindicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. \n\nLiver function \n\nIt should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, \nliver function should be checked every 6 months. \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nIn the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol \nis not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). \n\nSubstances interfering with CYP enzymes \n\nStiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly \nincrease the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk \nof adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is \ncatalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when \ncombining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is \nrecommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on \nstiripentol therapy. \n\nStiripentol powder for oral suspension in sachet contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.  \n\n\n\n27\n\nNeither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks \nof age. Therefore it may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Patients with rare glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine, as the formulation contains glucose. As the \nflavouring component contains small amount of sorbitol, patients with hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol \n\nThe influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well \nestablished. \nThe impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal product on stiripentol metabolism, that are \nknown to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the \neffect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. \n\nIn vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other \nsubstances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nEffect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes \n\nMany of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The \nincrease in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar \nin adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. \n\nAt therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for \nexample, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic \norigin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic \nlevels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase \nin adverse reactions. \nCaution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. several HIV protease \ninhibitors, antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, \noral contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section \nfor antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is \nrecommended. A dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to \nthe markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  \n\nData on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with \ntheophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of increased plasma levels of theophylline and \ncaffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. \nUse in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to \nmedicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods and nutritional products aimed at \nchildren: Patient should not drink cola drinks, which contain significant quantities of caffeine or \nchocolate, which contains trace amounts of theophylline (see section 4.2). \n\nAs stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, \nsubstances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, \ntimolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), \nantipsychotics (haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to \nmetabolic interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. \n\n\n\n28\n\nPotential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products \n\nIn the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant \ninteractions with stiripentol: \n\nUndesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) \n- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) \nErgotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). \n\n- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil \nIncreased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. \n\n- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) \nRaised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). \n\n- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) \nIncreased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic \nmetabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product). \n\nCombinations requiring precautions \n\n- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam \nIncreased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to \nexcessive sedation. \n\n- Chlorpromazine \nStiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. \n\n- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) \nInhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions \n(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nclobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), \nethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants \nwith potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when \ncombined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. \n\n- Topiramate \nIn a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam \nand valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there \nis no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-\nadministered with stiripentol. \nWith regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 \nshould not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma \nconcentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. \n\n- Levetiracetam \nLevetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no \npharmacokinetic metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other \nfactors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large \n\n\n\n29\n\nextent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been \nnoted with polytherapy. \nHowever, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the \naggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n\nRisk related to stiripentol \nNo data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect \nharmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at \nnon-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical \ndecision for use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into \nconsideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nto pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIn the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely \nfrom plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case \nstiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully \nobserved for potential adverse effects. \n\nFertility \n\nNo impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, \npotential risk for human is unknown. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nsome patients may experience dizziness and ataxia that may affect ability to drive and use machines \nand patients should not drive or use machinery whilst on stiripentol therapy. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, \nataxia, hypotonia and dystonia. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing severity. \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n(MedDRA \nterminology)\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nNeutropenia  Thrombocytopenia *\n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\nAnorexia, loss \nof appetite, \nweight loss \n\n\n\n30\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Aggressiveness, \nirritability, \nbehaviour disorders, \nopposing behaviour, \nhyperexcitability, \nsleep disorders \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDrowsiness, \nataxia, \nhypotonia, \ndystonia\n\nHyperkinesias \n\nEye disorders Diplopia \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, vomiting \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nPhotosensitivity, \nrash, cutaneous \nallergy, urticaria\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n\nInvestigations Raised \u03b3GT  Liver function test \nabnormal\n\n* Thrombocytopenia data are derived from both clinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nMany of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other \nanticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these \nmedicinal products is reduced. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nData on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in \nintensive care units). \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIn animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and \nbicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid \n(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition \nof synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n31\n\nshown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and \nincrease the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a \nbarbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as \ncarbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result \nof pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic \ninhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic \nmetabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \n\nA French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis \nof Dravet\u2019s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision \nfor use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual \npatient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). \n\n41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a \nbaseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam \nduring a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. \nResponders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-\nclonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. \n15 (71%) patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic \nseizures), whereas there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI \n52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change \nfrom baseline was higher on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on \nstiripentol had moderate side-effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, \nbut side-effects disappeared when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases \n(Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  \n\nThere are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses \ngreater than 50 mg/kg/day.  \nThere are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as monotherapy in Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult \nhealthy volunteers and adult patients. \n\nAbsorption \n\nStiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available \nfor testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. \n\nRelative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations \nhas been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two \nformulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was \nslightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax\nwas similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the \nstiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. \n\nDistribution \n\nStiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). \n\n\n\n32\n\nElimination \n\nSystemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma \nclearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of \n600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated \nadministration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nresponsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, \nincreasing with dose. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nStiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main \nmetabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the \nenzymes involved has not yet been achieved. \nOn the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 \nmetabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. \n\nExcretion \n\nMost stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. \nUrinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose \nwhereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. \n\nPaediatric population pharmacokinetic study \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with \nstiripentol and two substances not known to affect stiripentol pharmacokinetics, valproate and \nclobazam. The median age was 7.3 years (range: 1 to 17.6 years) and the median daily dose of \nstiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. \n\nThe data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination \nprocesses. The population estimate for the absorption rate constant Ka was 2.08 hr-1 (standard \ndeviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body \nweight by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased \nfrom 10 to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of \ndistribution increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for \n10 kg) to 23.5 hr (for 60 kg). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nToxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity \napart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high \ndoses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and nonrodents. This finding is considered to \nbe an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  \nStiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in \nseveral other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic \ndose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of \nGood Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive \nperformance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in \nthe survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of \n800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  \nCarcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase \nin the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day \nfor 78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol \nand the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of \n\n\n\n33\n\nhepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in \npatients. \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for oral suspension \nPale pink crystalline powder\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDiacomit is indicated for use in conjunction with clobazam and valproate as adjunctive therapy of \nrefractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n(SMEI, Dravet\u2019s syndrome) whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and \nvalproate. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nDiacomit should only be administered under the supervision of a paediatrician / paediatric neurologist \nexperienced in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in infants and children.  \n\nPosology \n\nThe dose of stiripentol is calculated on a mg/kg body weight basis. \n\nThe daily dosage may be administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. \n\nThe initiation of adjunctive therapy with stiripentol should be undertaken gradually using upwards \ndose escalation to reach the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered in conjunction with \nclobazam and valproate.  \n\nStiripentol dosage escalation should be gradual, starting with 20mg/kg/day for 1 week, then \n30mg/kg/day for 1 week.  Further dosage escalation is age dependent: \n- children less than 6 years should receive an additional 20 mg/kg/day in the third week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in three weeks; \n- children from 6 to less than 12 years should receive an additional 10 mg/kg/day each week, thus \nachieving the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day in four weeks; \n- children and adolescents 12 years and older should receive an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week \nuntil the optimum dose is reached based on clinical judgment. \n\n\n\n36\n\nThe recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day is based on the available clinical study findings and was the \nonly dose of Diacomit evaluated in the pivotal studies (see section 5.1). \n\nStiripentol must always be taken with food as it degrades rapidly in an acidic environment (e.g. \nexposure to gastric acid in an empty stomach). \nStiripentol should not be taken with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheese, etc.), \ncarbonated drinks, fruit juice or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline. \n\nChildren aged less than 3 years \nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \nThe clinical decision for use of stiripentol in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be \nmade on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. \nIn this younger group of patients, adjunctive therapy with Diacomit should only be started when the \ndiagnosis of SMEI has been clinically confirmed (see section 5.1). Data are limited about the use of \nstiripentol under 12 months of age. In these children, the use of stiripentol will be done under the \nclose supervision of the doctor. \n\nPatients aged \u2265 18 years of age \nLong-term data has not been collected in a sufficient number of adults to confirm maintenance of \neffect in this population. Treatment should be continued for as long as efficacy is observed. \n\nDose adjustments of other antiepileptics used in combination with stiripentol \n\nDespite the absence of comprehensive pharmacology data on potential drug interactions, the \nfollowing advice regarding modification of the dose and dosage schedules of other anti-epileptic \nmedicinal products administered in conjunction with stiripentol is provided based on clinical \nexperience. \n\n- Clobazam \nIn the pivotal studies, when the use of stiripentol was initiated, the daily dose of clobazam was \n0.5 mg/kg/day usually administered in divided doses, twice daily. In the event of clinical signs of \nadverse reactions or overdose of clobazam (i.e., drowsiness, hypotonia, and irritability in young \nchildren), this daily dose was reduced by 25% every week. Approximately two to three-fold increases \nin clobazam and five-fold increases in norclobazam plasma levels respectively have been reported \nwith co-administration of stiripentol in children with Dravet\u2019s syndrome. \n\n- Valproate \nThe potential for metabolic interaction between stiripentol and valproate is considered modest and \nthus, no modification of valproate dosage should be needed when stiripentol is added, except for \nclinical safety reasons. In the pivotal studies in the event of gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as \nloss of appetite, loss of weight, the daily dose of valproate was reduced by around 30% every week. \n\nAbnormal laboratory findings \nIn the event of an abnormal blood count or liver function test finding, the clinical decision for \ncontinuing use or adjusting the dose of stiripentol in conjunction with adjusting the doses of clobazam \nand valproate needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into consideration the potential \nclinical benefits and risks (see section 4.4). \n\nEffect of formulation \nThe sachet formulation has a slightly higher Cmax than the capsules and thus the formulations are not \nbioequivalent. It is recommended that if a switch of formulations is required this is done under \nclinical supervision, in case of problems with tolerability (see section 5.2). \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nStiripentol is not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n37\n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use \nThe powder should be mixed in a glass of water and should be taken immediately after mixing. For \nthe interaction of stiripentol with food, see section 4.5. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nA past history of psychoses in the form of episodes of delirium. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCarbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital \n\nThese substances should not be used in conjunction with stiripentol in the management of Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. The daily dosage of clobazam and/or valproate should be reduced according to the onset of \nside effects whilst on stiripentol therapy (see section 4.2). \n\nGrowth rate of children \n\nGiven the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions to treatment with stiripentol and valproate \n(anorexia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting), the growth rate of children under this combination of \ntreatment should be carefully monitored. \n\nBlood count \n\nNeutropenia may be associated with the administration of stiripentol, clobazam and valproate. Blood \ncounts should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically \nindicated, blood counts should be checked every 6 months. \n\nLiver function \n\nIt should be assessed prior to starting treatment with stiripentol. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, \nliver function should be checked every 6 months. \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nIn the absence of specific clinical data in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, stiripentol \nis not recommended for use in patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal function (see section 4.2). \n\nSubstances interfering with CYP enzymes \n\nStiripentol is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and may markedly \nincrease the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these enzymes and increase the risk \nof adverse reactions (see section 4.5). In vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is \ncatalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when \ncombining stiripentol with other substances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pivotal clinical studies did not include children below 3 years old. As a consequence, it is \nrecommended that children between 6 months and 3 years of age are carefully monitored whilst on \nDiacomit therapy. \n\n\n\n38\n\nDiacomit powder for oral suspension in sachet contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Neither \nnon-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks of age. \nTherefore it may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Patients with rare glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption should not take this medicine, as the formulation contains glucose. As the flavouring \ncomponent contains small amount of sorbitol, patients with hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential medicinal product interactions affecting stiripentol \n\nThe influence of other antiepileptic medicinal products on stiripentol pharmacokinetics is not well \nestablished. \nThe impact of macrolides and azole antifungal medicinal product on stiripentol metabolism, that are \nknown to be inhibitors of CYP3A4 and substrates of the same enzyme, is not known. Likewise, the \neffect of stiripentol on their metabolism is not known. \n\nIn vitro studies suggested that stiripentol phase 1 metabolism is catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 and possibly other enzymes. Caution is advised when combining stiripentol with other \nsubstances that inhibit or induce one or more of these enzymes. \n\nEffect of stiripentol on cytochrome P450 enzymes \n\nMany of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The \nincrease in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol, valproate, and clobazam is similar \nin adults and children, though inter-individual variability is marked. \n\nAt therapeutic concentrations, stiripentol significantly inhibits several CYP450 isoenzymes: for \nexample, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. As a result, pharmacokinetic interactions of metabolic \norigin with other medicines may be expected. These interactions may result in increased systemic \nlevels of these active substances that may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and to an increase \nin adverse reactions. \n\nCaution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substances \nmetabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. citalopram, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 (e.g. several HIV protease \ninhibitors, antihistamines such as astemizole and chlorpheniramine, calcium channel blockers, statins, \noral contraceptives, codeine) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions (see further in this section \nfor antiepileptic medicines). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions is \nrecommended. A dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to \nthe markedly increased risk of severe adverse reactions.  \n\nData on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with \ntheophylline and caffeine cannot be excluded because of increased plasma levels of theophylline and \ncaffeine which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. \nUse in combination with stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to \nmedicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods and nutritional products aimed at \nchildren: Patient should not drink cola drinks, which contain significant quantities of caffeine or \nchocolate, which contains trace amounts of theophylline (see section 4.2). \n\nAs stiripentol inhibited CYP2D6 in vitro at concentrations that are achieved clinically in plasma, \nsubstances that are metabolized by this isoenzyme like: beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, \ntimolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine), \nantipsychotics (haloperidol), analgesics (codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol) may be subject to \nmetabolic interactions with stiripentol. A dose-adjustment may be necessary for substances \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 and that are individually dose titrated. \n\n\n\n39\n\nPotential for stiripentol to interact with other medicinal products \n\nIn the absence of available clinical data, caution should be taken with the following clinically relevant \ninteractions with stiripentol: \n\nUndesirable combinations (to be avoided unless strictly necessary) \n- Rye ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) \nErgotism with possibility of necrosis of the extremities (inhibition of hepatic elimination of rye ergot). \n\n- Cisapride, halofantrine, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil \nIncreased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular. \n\n- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) \nRaised blood levels of immunosuppressants (decreased hepatic metabolism). \n\n- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, etc.) \nIncreased risk of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis (decreased hepatic \nmetabolism of cholesterol-lowering medicinal product).  \n\nCombinations requiring precautions \n\n- Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam \nIncreased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to \nexcessive sedation. \n\n- Chlorpromazine \nStiripentol enhances the central depressant effect of chlorpromazine. \n\n- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) \nInhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions \n(inhibition of their hepatic metabolism) with phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nclobazam (see section 4.2), valproate (see section 4.2), diazepam (enhanced myorelaxation), \nethosuximide, and tiagabine. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvulsants \nwith potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when \ncombined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. \n\n- Topiramate \nIn a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramate was added to stiripentol, clobazam \nand valproate in 41% of 230 cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there \nis no evidence to suggest that a change in topiramate dose and dosage schedules is needed if co-\nadministered with stiripentol. \nWith regard to topiramate, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 \nshould not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5-15 times higher than plasma \nconcentrations obtained with the standard recommended topiramate dose and dosage schedules. \n\n- Levetiracetam \nLevetiracetam does not undergo hepatic metabolism to a major extent. As a result, no \npharmacokinetic metabolic drug interaction between stiripentol and levetiracetam is anticipated. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Although other \n\n\n\n40\n\nfactors, e.g. the epilepsy, can contribute, available evidence suggests that this increase, to a large \nextent, is caused by the treatment. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been \nnoted with polytherapy. \nHowever, effective anti-epileptic therapy should not be interrupted during pregnancy, since the \naggravation of the illness may be detrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n\nRisk related to stiripentol \nNo data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect \nharmful effects with respect to pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development at \nnon-maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). In view of the indication, administration of stiripentol \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential would not be expected. The clinical \ndecision for use of stiripentol in pregnancy needs to be made on an individual patient basis taking into \nconsideration the potential clinical benefits and risks. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nto pregnant women and use of efficient methods of contraception is advisable. \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIn the absence of human studies on excretion in breast milk, and given that stiripentol passes freely \nfrom plasma into milk in the goat, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. In case \nstiripentol therapy is continued during breast-feeding, the breast-fed infant should be carefully \nobserved for potential adverse effects. \n\nFertility \n\nNo impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, \npotential risk for human is unknown. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nsome patients may experience dizziness and ataxia that may affect ability to drive and use machines \nand patients should not drive or use machinery whilst on stiripentol therapy. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most common side effects with stiripentol are anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, \nataxia, hypotonia and dystonia. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions encountered most often are as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing severity. \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n(MedDRA \nterminology)\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nNeutropenia  Thrombocytopenia \n* \n\n\n\n41\n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\nAnorexia, loss \nof appetite, \nweight loss \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Aggressiveness, \nirritability, behaviour \ndisorders, opposing \nbehaviour, \nhyperexcitability, \nsleep disorders \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDrowsiness, \nataxia, \nhypotonia, \ndystonia\n\nHyperkinesias \n\nEye disorders Diplopia \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, vomiting \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nPhotosensitivity, \nrash, cutaneous \nallergy, urticaria\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue \n\nInvestigations Raised \u03b3GT  Liver function test \nabnormal\n\n* Thrombocytopenia data are derived from both clinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nMany of the above adverse reactions are often due to an increase in plasma levels of other \nanticonvulsant medicinal products (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) and may regress when the dose of these \nmedicinal products is reduced.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nData on clinical overdose are not available. Treatment is supportive (symptomatic measures in \nintensive care units). \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX17 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n42\n\nIn animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and \nbicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid \n(GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition \nof synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been \nshown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and \nincrease the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a \nbarbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as \ncarbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result \nof pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic \ninhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic \nmetabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe pivotal clinical evaluation of stiripentol was in children of 3 years of age and over with SMEI. \n\nA French compassionate use program included children from 6 months of age because the diagnosis \nof Dravet\u2019s syndrome may be made with confidence at that age in some patients. The clinical decision \nfor use of Diacomit in children with SMEI less than 3 years of age needs to be made on an individual \npatient basis taking into consideration the potential clinical benefits and risks (see section 4.2). \n\n41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a \nbaseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam \nduring a double-blind period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion. \nResponders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of clonic (or tonic-\nclonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind period compared with baseline. \n15 (71%) patients were responders on stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic \nseizures), whereas there was only one (5%) on placebo (none was seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI \n52.1-90.7 vs. placebo 0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7. Percentage of change \nfrom baseline was higher on stiripentol (-69%) than on placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on \nstiripentol had moderate side-effects (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, \nbut side-effects disappeared when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases \n(Chiron et al, Lancet, 2000).  \n\nThere are no clinical study data to support the clinical safety of stiripentol administered at daily doses \ngreater than 50 mg/kg/day.  \nThere are no clinical study data to support the use of stiripentol as monotherapy in Dravet\u2019s \nsyndrome. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe following pharmacokinetic properties of stiripentol have been reported from studies in adult \nhealthy volunteers and adult patients. \n\nAbsorption  \n\nStiripentol is quickly absorbed, with a time to peak plasma concentration of about 1.5 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of stiripentol is not known since an intravenous formulation is not available \nfor testing. It is well absorbed by the oral route since the majority of an oral dose is excreted in urine. \n\nRelative bioavailability between the capsules and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations \nhas been studied in healthy male volunteers after a 1,000 mg single oral administration. The two \nformulations were bioequivalent in terms of AUC but not in terms of Cmax. Cmax of the sachet was \nslightly higher (23%) compared with the capsule and did not meet the criteria for bioequivalence. Tmax\nwas similar with both formulations. Clinical supervision is recommended if switching between the \nstiripentol capsule and powder for oral suspension in sachet formulations. \n\n\n\n43\n\nDistribution \n\nStiripentol binds extensively to circulating plasma proteins (about 99%). \n\nElimination \n\nSystemic exposure to stiripentol increases markedly compared to dose proportionality. Plasma \nclearance decreases markedly at high doses; it falls from approximately 40 l/kg/day at the dose of \n600 mg/day to about 8 l/kg/day at the dose of 2,400 mg. Clearance is decreased after repeated \nadministration of stiripentol, probably due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \nresponsible for its metabolism. The half-life of elimination was in the range of 4.5 hours to 13 hours, \nincreasing with dose. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nStiripentol is extensively metabolized, 13 different metabolites having been found in urine. The main \nmetabolic processes are demethylenation and glucuronidation, although precise identification of the \nenzymes involved has not yet been achieved. \nOn the basis of in vitro studies, the principal liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in phase 1 \nmetabolism are considered to be CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. \n\nExcretion \n\nMost stiripentol is excreted via the kidney. \nUrinary metabolites of stiripentol accounted collectively for the majority (73%) of an oral acute dose \nwhereas a further 13-24% was recovered in faeces as unchanged substance. \n\nPaediatric population pharmacokinetic study \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 35 children with Dravet Syndrome treated with \nstiripentol and two substances not known to affect stiripentol pharmacokinetics, valproate and \nclobazam. The median age was 7.3 years (range: 1 to 17.6 years) and the median daily dose of \nstiripentol was 45.4 mg/kg/day (range: 27.1 to 89.3 mg/kg/day) received in two or three divided doses. \n\nThe data were best fitted with a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination \nprocesses. The population estimate for the absorption rate constant Ka was 2.08 hr-1 (standard \ndeviation of random effect = 122%). Clearance and volume of distribution were related to body \nweight by an allometric model with exponents of 0.433 and 1, respectively: as body weight increased \nfrom 10 to 60 kg, apparent oral clearance increased from 2.60 to 5.65 L/hr and apparent volume of \ndistribution increased from 32.0 to 191.8 L. As a result, elimination half-life increased from 8.5hr (for \n10 kg) to 23.5 hr (for 60 kg). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nToxicity studies in animals (rat, monkey, mouse) have not revealed any consistent pattern of toxicity \napart from liver enlargement associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, which occurred when high \ndoses of stiripentol were administered to both rodents and nonrodents. This finding is considered to \nbe an adaptive response to a high metabolic burden on the liver.  \nStiripentol was not teratogenic when tested in the rat and rabbit; in one study in the mouse, but not in \nseveral other similar studies, a low incidence of cleft palate formation was observed at a maternotoxic \ndose (800 mg/kg/day). These studies in mice and rabbits were undertaken prior to the introduction of \nGood Laboratory Practice requirements. Studies in the rat on fertility and general reproductive \nperformance and on pre- and postnatal development were uneventful except for a minor reduction in \nthe survival of pups nursed by mothers exhibiting toxic responses to stiripentol at a dose of \n800 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).  \nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity.  \n\n\n\n44\n\nCarcinogenicity studies gave negative results in the rat. In the mouse there was only a small increase \nin the incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in animals treated with 200 or 600 mg/kg/day \nfor 78 weeks but not in those given 60 mg/kg/day. In view of the lack of genotoxicity of stiripentol \nand the well known, special susceptibility of the mouse liver to tumour formation in the presence of \nhepatic enzyme induction, this finding is not considered to indicate a risk of tumorigenicity in \npatients. \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their symptoms are the same as your child\u2019s.\n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See Section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Diacomit is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child takes Diacomit \n3. How to take Diacomit \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Diacomit \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n1. What Diacomit is and what it is used for\n\nStiripentol, the active ingredient of Diacomit, belongs to a group of medicines called antiepileptics.  \n\nIt is used in conjunction with clobazam and valproate (other antiepileptic medicines) to treat a certain \nform of epilepsy called severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet\u2019s syndrome), which affects \nchildren. Your child\u2019s doctor has prescribed this medicine to help treat your child\u2019s epilepsy. It should \nalways be taken in combination with clobazam and valproate under the direction of a doctor.  \n\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Diacomit\n\nYour child must NOT take Diacomit \n\uf0b7 if your child is allergic to stiripentol or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 if your child has ever experienced attacks of delirium (a mental state with confusion, \n\nexcitement, restlessness and hallucinations). \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist before taking Diacomit \n\uf0b7 if your child has kidney or liver problems. \n\uf0b7 Your child\u2019s liver function should be assessed prior to starting Diacomit and checked every 6 \n\nmonths. \n\uf0b7 Your child\u2019s blood count should be assessed prior to starting Diacomit and checked every 6 \n\nmonths. \n\uf0b7 Because the frequency of gastrointestinal side effect with Diacomit, clobazam and valproate, \n\nsuch as anorexia, loss of appetite, vomiting, your child\u2019s growth rate should be carefully \nmonitored. \n\n\n\n67\n\nOther medicines and Diacomit \n\nTell your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. \n\nTell your doctor if your child is taking any of the following medicines: \n\uf0b7 medicines containing:  \n- cisapride (used to treat symptoms of night time heartburn);  \n- pimozide (used to treat the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome e.g. vocal outbursts and \n\nuncontrolled, repeated movements of the body);  \n- ergotamine (used to treat migraine);  \n- dihydroergotamine (used to relieve the signs and symptoms of decreased mental capacity due to \n\nthe aging process);  \n- halofantrine (an antimalarial treatment);  \n- quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms);  \n- bepridil (used to control chest pain);  \n- cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (all three used to prevent rejections of liver, kidney and \n\nheart transplants); \n- statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin, both used to reduce the amount of cholesterol in blood).\n- antiepileptic medicines containing: \n\nphenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, diazepam. \n- medicines containing:  \n\nmidazolam or triazolam (medicines used to reduce anxiety and sleeplessness \u2013 in combination \nwith Diacomit they may make your child very sleepy);  \nchlorpromazine (used for mental illness such as psychosis). \n\n- If your child takes medicines containing:  \ncaffeine (this substance helps restore mental alertness) or theophylline (this substance is used in \ncase of asthma). The combination with Diacomit should be avoided as it may increase their \nblood levels, leading to digestive disorders, racing heart and insomnia. \n\n\uf0b7 If your child takes medicines metabolized by certain liver enzymes: \n- citalopram (used in the treatment of depressive episodes);  \n- omeprazole (used in case of gastric ulcer); \n- HIV protease inhibitors (used in the treatment of HIV); \n- astemizole, chlorpheniramine (antihistamines); \n- calcium channel blockers (used in the treatment of angor or troubles of heart rhythm);  \n- oral contraceptives;  \n- propranolol, carvedilol, timolol (used in the treatment of high blood pressure);  \n- fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine (antidepressants) ;  \n- haloperidol (antipsychotics);  \n- codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol (used in the treatment of pain).  \n\nDiacomit with food and drink\nDo NOT take Diacomit with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheeses, etc), fruit juice, \nfizzy drinks or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline (for example cola, chocolate, \ncoffee, tea and energy drinks).  \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, think she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \nDuring pregnancy, effective antiepileptic treatment must NOT be stopped. \n\nBreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with this medicine. \n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine may make your child feel sleepy. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Sleepiness\n\n\n68\n\nYour child should not use any tools, machines, ride or drive if affected in this way. Check with your \nchild\u2019s doctor.  \n\nDiacomit contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n3. How to take Diacomit\n\nYour child should always take these capsules exactly as your child\u2019s doctor has told you. You should \ncheck with your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nDosage \nThe dose is adjusted by the doctor according to your child\u2019s age, weight and condition, generally \n50 mg per kg bodyweight and per day.  \n\nWhen to take Diacomit \nYour child should take this medicine two or three times a day at regular intervals as directed by your \nchild\u2019s doctor, for example morning - noon - bed-time to cover the night-and-day period.  \n\nDose adjustment \nDose increases should be gradual, taking place over a few weeks while the dose(s) of the other \nantiepileptic medicine(s) is (are) reduced at the same time. Your child\u2019s doctor will tell you the new \ndose of the other antiepileptic medicine(s). \n\nIf you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your \nchild\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. The dose will be adjusted by the doctor according to your child\u2019s \ncondition.  \n\nPlease consult your child\u2019s doctor in the event of any side effects as the doctor may have to adjust the \ndose of this medicine and the other antiepileptic medicine(s). \n\nThere are slight differences between the Diacomit capsules and powder for oral suspension. If your \nchild experiences any problems when switching from taking the capsules to the powder for oral \nsuspension or vice versa please inform your doctor. In case of switch between capsule and powder \nformulations it should be done under the close supervision of your child\u2019s doctor. \n\nIn case of vomiting within the first few minutes of intake it is assumed that no medicine has been \nabsorbed and a new dose should be given. \nHowever, the situation is different if the vomiting occurs more than one hour after medicine intake \nbecause stiripentol is quickly absorbed.  \nIn such a case, it is assumed that a significant fraction of the administered dose has been absorbed \nsystemically from the digestive tract. Thus, there would be no need for a new intake or for an \nadjustment of the next dose. \n\nHow to take the Diacomit capsules \nThese capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be chewed. Your \nchild should take Diacomit with food, it should NOT be taken on an empty stomach. For food and \ndrinks to be avoided, see the section \u201cDiacomit with food and drink\u201d above.  \n\nIf your child takes more Diacomit than he or she should\nContact your child\u2019s doctor if you know or think your child has taken more medicine than he or she \nshould have.  \n\n\n\n69\n\nIf your child forgets to take Diacomit\nIt is important that your child takes this medicine regularly at the same time each day. If your child \nforgets to take a dose, he or she should take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for the next \ndose. In that case carry on with the next dose as normal. Your child should not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten individual dose. \n\nIf your child stops taking Diacomit\nYour child must not stop taking this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. Stopping treatment \nsuddenly can lead to an outbreak of seizures. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than one in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 loss of appetite, weight loss (especially when combined with the antiepileptic medicine sodium \n\nvalproate); \n\uf0b7 insomnia (sleeplessness), drowsiness; \n\uf0b7 ataxia (inability to coordinate muscle movements), hypotonia (low muscle strength), dystonia \n\n(involuntary muscle contractions). \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 raised levels of liver enzymes, especially when given with either of the antiepileptic medicines \n\ncarbamazepine and sodium valproate; \n\uf0b7 aggressiveness, irritability, agitation, hyperexcitability (state of being unusually excitable); \n\uf0b7 sleep disorders (abnormal sleeping); \n\uf0b7 hyperkinesis (exaggerated movements); \n\uf0b7 nausea, vomiting; \n\uf0b7 a low number of a type of white blood cells. \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\uf0b7 double vision when used in combination with the antiepileptic medicine carbamazepine;\n\uf0b7 sensitivity to light;\n\uf0b7 rash, skin allergy, urticaria (pinkish, itchy swellings on the skin); \n\uf0b7 fatigue (tiredness).\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n\uf0b7 decrease of platelet level in the blood; \n\uf0b7 abnormal liver function test. \n\nTo eliminate these side effects, your child\u2019s doctor may have to change the dose of Diacomit or one of \nthe other medicines prescribed for your child. \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.

How to store Diacomit \n\n\uf0b7 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n70\n\n\uf0b7 Your child should not take Diacomit after the expiry date, which is stated on the label after \n\u201cEXP\u201d.

What Diacomit is and what it is used for\n\nStiripentol, the active ingredient of Diacomit, belongs to a group of medicines called antiepileptics.  \n\nIt is used in conjunction with clobazam and valproate (other antiepileptic medicines) to treat a certain \nform of epilepsy called severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet\u2019s syndrome), which affects \nchildren. Your child\u2019s doctor has prescribed this medicine to help treat your child\u2019s epilepsy. It should \nalways be taken in combination with clobazam and valproate under the direction of a doctor.  \n\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Diacomit\n\nYour child must NOT take Diacomit \n\uf0b7 if your child is allergic to stiripentol or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 if your child has ever experienced attacks of delirium (a mental state with confusion, \n\nexcitement, restlessness and hallucinations). \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist before taking Diacomit \n\uf0b7 if your child has kidney or liver problems. \n\uf0b7 Your child\u2019s liver function should be assessed prior to starting Diacomit and checked every 6 \n\nmonths. \n\uf0b7 Your child\u2019s blood count should be assessed prior to starting Diacomit and checked every 6 \n\nmonths. \n\uf0b7 Because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects with Diacomit, clobazam and \n\nvalproate, such as anorexia, loss of appetite, vomiting, your child\u2019s growth rate should be \ncarefully monitored. \n\nIf your child has problems with certain ingredients of Diacomit (e.g. aspartame, glucose, sorbitol). In \nthis case, please see below: \u201cImportant information about some of the ingredients of Diacomit\u201d. \n\n\n\n74\n\nOther medicines and Diacomit \n\nTell your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. \nTell your doctor if your child is taking any of the following medicines: \n\uf0b7 medicines containing:  \n- cisapride (used to treat symptoms of night time heartburn);  \n- pimozide (used to treat the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome e.g. vocal outbursts and \n\nuncontrolled, repeated movements of the body);  \n- ergotamine (used to treat migraine);  \n- dihydroergotamine (used to relieve the signs and symptoms of decreased mental capacity due to \n\nthe aging process);  \n- halofantrine (an antimalarial treatment);  \n- quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms);  \n- bepridil (used to control chest pain);  \n- cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (all three used to prevent rejections of liver, kidney and \n\nheart transplants); \n- statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin, both used to reduce the amount of cholesterol in blood).\n- antiepileptic medicines containing: \n\nphenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, diazepam. \n- medicines containing:  \n\nmidazolam or triazolam (medicines used to reduce anxiety and sleeplessness \u2013 in combination \nwith Diacomit they may make your child very sleepy);  \nchlorpromazine (used for mental illness such as psychosis). \n\n- If your child takes medicines containing:  \nCaffeine (this substance helps restore mental alertness) or theophylline (this substance is used \nin case of asthma). The combination with Diacomit should be avoided as it may increase their \nblood levels, leading to digestive disorders, racing heart and insomnia. \n\n\uf0b7 If your child takes medicines metabolized by certain liver enzymes: \n- citalopram (used in the treatment of depressive episodes); \n- omeprazole (used in case of gastric ulcer); \n- HIV protease inhibitors (used in the treatment of HIV); \n- astemizole, chlorpheniramine (antihistamines); \n- calcium channel blockers (used in the treatment of angor or troubles of heart rhythm);  \n- oral contraceptives;  \n- propranolol, carvedilol, timolol (used in the treatment of high blood pressure);  \n- fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine (antidepressants) ;  \n- haloperidol (antipsychotics);  \n- codeine, dextromethorphan, tramadol (used in the treatment of pain).  \n\nDiacomit with food and drink\nDo NOT take Diacomit with milk or dairy products (yoghurt, soft cream cheeses, etc), fruit juice, \nfizzy drinks or food and drinks that contain caffeine or theophylline (for example cola, chocolate, \ncoffee, tea and energy drinks).  \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, think she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\nDuring pregnancy, effective antiepileptic treatment must NOT be stopped. \n\nBreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with this medicine. \n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine may make your child feel sleepy. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Sleepiness\n\n\n75\n\nYour child should not use any tools, machines, ride or drive if affected in this way. Check with your \nchild\u2019s doctor.  \n\nDiacomit contains aspartame, glucose, sorbitol and sodium \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg aspartame in each 250mg-sachet and 5 mg each 500mg-sachet. \nAspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare \ngenetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. \nThis medicine contains sorbitol: 2.4 mg in each 250mg-sachet and 4.8 mg in each 500mg-sachet. \nGlucose may be harmful to the teeth. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n3. How to take Diacomit\n\nYour child should always take the contents of each sachet exactly as your child\u2019s doctor has told you. \nYou should check with your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nDosage \nThe dose is adjusted by the doctor according to your child\u2019s age, weight and condition, generally \n50 mg per kg bodyweight and per day.  \n\nWhen to take Diacomit \nYour child should take this medicine two or three times a day at regular intervals as directed by your \nchild\u2019s doctor: for example morning - noon - bed-time to cover the night-and-day period. \n\nDose adjustment \nDose increases should be gradual, taking place over a few weeks while the dose(s) of the other \nantiepileptic medicine(s) is (are) reduced at the same time. Your child\u2019s doctor will tell you the new \ndose of the other antiepileptic medicine(s). \n\nIf you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your \nchild\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. The dose will be adjusted by the doctor according to your child\u2019s \ncondition.  \n\nPlease consult your child\u2019s doctor in the event of any side effects as the doctor may have to adjust the \ndose of this medicine and the other antiepileptic medicine(s). \n\nThere are slight differences between the Diacomit capsules and powder for oral suspension. If your \nchild experiences any problems when switching from taking the capsules to the powder for oral \nsuspension or vice versa please inform your doctor. In case of switch between capsule and powder \nformulation it should be done under the close supervision of your child\u2019s doctor. \n\nIn case of vomiting within the first few minutes of intake it is assumed that no medicine has been \nabsorbed and a new dose should be given. \nHowever, the situation is different if the vomiting occurs more than one hour after medicine intake \nbecause stiripentol is quickly absorbed. In such a case, it is assumed that a significant fraction of the \nadministered dose has been absorbed systemically from the digestive tract. Thus, there would be no \nneed for a new intake or for an adjustment of the next dose. \n\nHow to take the Diacomit powder for oral suspension \nThe powder should be mixed in a glass of water and should be taken immediately after mixing during \nthe meal. Your child should take Diacomit with food, it should NOT be taken on an empty stomach. \nFor food and drinks to be avoided, see the section \u201cDiacomit with food and drink\u201d above. \n\n\n\n76\n\nIf your child takes more Diacomit than he or she should\nContact your child\u2019s doctor if you know or think your child has taken more medicine than he or she \nshould have.  \n\nIf your child forgets to take Diacomit\nIt is important that your child takes this medicine regularly at the same time each day. If your child \nforgets to take a dose, he or she should take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for the next \ndose. In that case carry on with the next dose as normal. Your child should not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten individual dose. \n\nIf your child stops taking Diacomit\nYour child must not stop taking this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. Stopping treatment \nsuddenly can lead to an outbreak of seizures. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than one in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 loss of appetite, weight loss (especially when combined with the antiepileptic medicine sodium \n\nvalproate); \n\uf0b7 insomnia (sleeplessness), drowsiness; \n\uf0b7 ataxia (inability to coordinate muscle movements), hypotonia (low muscle strength), dystonia \n\n(involuntary muscle contractions). \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to1 in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 raised levels of liver enzymes, especially when given with either of the antiepileptic medicines \n\ncarbamazepine and sodium valproate; \n\uf0b7 aggressiveness, irritability, agitation, hyperexcitability (state of being unusually excitable); \n\uf0b7 sleep disorders (abnormal sleeping); \n\uf0b7 hyperkinesis (exaggerated movements); \n\uf0b7 nausea, vomiting; \n\uf0b7 a low number of a type of white blood cells. \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\uf0b7 double vision when used in combination with the antiepileptic medicine carbamazepine;\n\uf0b7 sensitivity to light;\n\uf0b7 rash, skin allergy, urticaria (pinkish, itchy swellings on the skin); \n\uf0b7 fatigue (tiredness).\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n\uf0b7 decrease of platelet level in the blood; \n\uf0b7 abnormal liver function test \n\nTo eliminate these side effects, your child\u2019s doctor may have to change the dose of Diacomit or one of \nthe other medicines prescribed for your child. \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.

exactly as your child's doctor has told you. you should check with your child's doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dosage the dose is adjusted by the doctor according to your child's age, weight and condition, generally 50 mg per kg bodyweight and per day. when to take diacomit your child should take this medicine two or three times a day at regular intervals as directed by your child's doctor, for example morning - noon - bed-time to cover the night-and-day period. dose adjustment dose increases should be gradual, taking place over a few weeks while the dose(s) of the other antiepileptic medicine(s) is (are) reduced at the same time. your child's doctor will tell you the new dose of the other antiepileptic medicine(s). if you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your child's doctor or pharmacist. the dose will be adjusted by the doctor according to your child's condition. please consult your child's doctor in the event of any side effects as the doctor may have to adjust the dose of this medicine and the other antiepileptic medicine(s). there are slight differences between the diacomit capsules and powder for oral suspension. if your child experiences any problems when switching from taking the capsules to the powder for oral suspension or vice versa please inform your doctor. in case of switch between capsule and powder formulations it should be done under the close supervision of your child's doctor. in case of vomiting within the first few minutes of intake it is assumed that no medicine has been absorbed and a new dose should be given. however, the situation is different if the vomiting occurs more than one hour after medicine intake because stiripentol is quickly absorbed. in such a case, it is assumed that a significant fraction of the administered dose has been absorbed systemically from the digestive tract. thus, there would be no need for a new intake or for an adjustment of the next dose. how to take the diacomit capsules these capsules should be swallowed whole with water. the capsules should not be chewed. your child should take diacomit with food, it should not be taken on an empty stomach. for food and drinks to be avoided, see the section \"diacomit with food and drink\" above. if your child takes more diacomit than he or she should contact your child's doctor if you know or think your child has taken more medicine than he or she should have. if your child forgets to take diacomit it is important that your child takes this medicine regularly at the same time each day. if your child forgets to take a dose, he or she should take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for the next dose. in that case carry on with the next dose as normal. your child should not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. if your child stops taking diacomit your child must not stop taking this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. stopping treatment suddenly can lead to an outbreak of seizures. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child's doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "diacomit",
