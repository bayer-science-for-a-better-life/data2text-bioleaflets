NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTemozolomide Accord 5 mg hard capsules. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 5 mg temozolomide. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach hard capsule contains 168 mg of anhydrous lactose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule.  \n \nThe hard capsules are green/white hard gelatin capsules imprinted ‘TMZ’ on cap & ‘5’ on body. \n \nEach capsule is approximately 15 mm in length. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  \n-  adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n-  children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours.  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or discontinuation \nof TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and non-haematological \ntoxicity criteria.  TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to \n49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  \n- thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n\n\n\n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1.TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during \n concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count ≥ 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological toxicity \n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) \n\n \nCTC Grade 2 \n\n \nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \nabsolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \ntoxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n\n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of \nmonotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by \n23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-\nhaematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not \nescalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. Once escalated, the dose \nremains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs. \nDose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should be applied according to \nTables 2 and 3.  \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n\n\n\n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there is \nno haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. \nExperience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients.  \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is not \naffected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should be administered in the fasting state.  \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n  \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections (such \nas HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule were \nshown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, prophylaxis \nagainst PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 day regimen (with \na maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they are to continue the \nprophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤1.  \n \n\n\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely \nfor the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have been \nreported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other steroids. \n \nHBV \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been reported. \nExperts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with positive \nhepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be monitored \nand managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If abnormal, \nphysicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the potential for fatal \nhepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway \nduring this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. For \npatients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the benefit/risk of \ncontinuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with \ntemozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy  \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it   \nis strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may require \nanti-emetic therapy.  \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which \nmay result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, \nexposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, the following \nlaboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l. A complete blood \ncount should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and \nweekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the \n\n\n\nplatelet count is < 50 x109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced one dose level (see \nsection 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose \nis 100 mg/m2.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in older \nchildren and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients  appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly patients.    \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n  \nLactose  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.  \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC).  \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord should \nbe administered without food.  \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, \nteratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide Accord should \nnot be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \n Breast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ.  \n \nMale fertility  \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior \nto treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8) . \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nClinical trial experience \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic adverse \nreactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after \nTable 4. For patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were \nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed \nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common \n\n\n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse events were \ncombined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil \nabnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nthrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the patients \nwho received TMZ.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and 4 \n%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir \nbetween Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of \nbleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia \n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3 %, in women vs men in \nthe first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 \n% of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0% of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although the \ndata is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse events after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, over \n5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, multi-\norgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for more \nthan 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse reactions reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In the \nevent of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be provided as \nnecessary. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the active \nmonomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be due \nprimarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at the N7 \nposition. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of the methyl \nadduct.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day of \n\n\n\nRT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in the \nRT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < \n0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs 10%) \nis higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated a \nstatistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \n Figure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance status \n(WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. However, \nno unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status [KPS] \n≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral TMZ. \nOne was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the other was a \nrandomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67% received prior \ntreatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint was progression-\nfree survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-comparative trial, the \nPFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 months, and the median overall \nsurvival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI scans was 8%.  \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ \nand procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) (chi-square p = \n0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS ≥ 80.  \n \n\n\n\nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time to \nworsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).  \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma  \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the treatment \nof patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The median PFS was \n5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the central reviewer \nassessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to- treat-population (ITT) n=162. In 43 patients \nstable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT population was 44% with a \nmedian event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results for the progression-free \nsurvival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were similar. Achieving a radiological \nobjective response or maintaining progression-free status was strongly associated with maintained or \nimproved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance to \nTMZ is similar to adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-1-\nyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Relative \nto the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of \nMTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached as \nearly as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% \nindicating complete absorption.  \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with highly \nprotein-bound substances.  \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses rapidly the blood-brain barrier and \nis present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC of \nTMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine \nover 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide \n(AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose.  \n\n\n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) \nwas 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, testes, \nthe gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and dogs tested, \ndegeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, except for \nadverse reactions on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because the doses \nimplicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect has been \nobserved in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. Dose-\nrelated reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A variety of \nneoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell adenoma were \nobserved in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were evident in dog studies. \nRats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the occurrence of first tumours \nwithin 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even for an alkylating agent.  \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCapsule contents  \nAnhydrous lactose  \nColloidal anhydrous silica \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nTartaric acid \nStearic acid  \n \nCapsule shell \nGelatine \nWater \nTitanium dioxide (E171) \nIron oxide yellow (E172) \nIndigo carmine (E132) \n \nPrinting ink \nShellac \n \nPropylene glycol \nBlack iron oxide (E172) \nPotassium hydroxide \n \n \n\n\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBottle \nDo not store above 25°C.  \nStore in the original bottle in order to protect from moisture.  \nKeep the bottle tightly closed. \n \nSachet \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBottle \nType III amber glass bottles with polypropylene child-resistant closures and a desiccant, containing 5 or \n20 capsules \nThe carton contains one bottle. \n \nSachet \nPolyester/aluminium/polyethylene (PET/alu/PE) sachet.  \nEach sachet contains 1 hard capsule.  \nPack-size of 5 or 20 hard capsules individually sealed in sachets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nCapsules should not be opened.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  \n-  adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n-  children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours.  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly - diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or discontinuation \nof TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and non-haematological \ntoxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to \n49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  \n- thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \n\n\n\nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.  \n \n \n\nTable 1.TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during \n concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count ≥ 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological toxicity \n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) \n\n \nCTC Grade 2 \n\n \nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \nabsolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \ntoxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n\n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of \nmonotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by \n23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-\nhaematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not \nescalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. Once escalated, the dose \nremains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs. \nDose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should be applied according to \nTables 2 and 3.  \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n\n\n\n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there is \nno haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. \nExperience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years have not beenestablished. No data are available.   \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients.  \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is not \naffected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should be administered in the fasting state.  \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n  \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections (such \nas HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42 -day schedule were \nshown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, prophylaxis \nagainst PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 day regimen (with \na maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they are to continue the \nprophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤1.  \n \n\n\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely \nfor the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have been \nreported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other steroids. \n \nHBV \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been reported. \nExperts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with positive \nhepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be monitored \nand managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If abnormal, \nphysicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the potential for fatal \nhepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway \nduring this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. For \npatients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the benefit/risk of \ncontinuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with \ntemozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy  \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it   \nis strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may require \nanti-emetic therapy.  \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which \nmay result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, \nexposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, the following \nlaboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l. A complete blood \ncount should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and \nweekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the \n\n\n\nplatelet count is < 50 x109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced one dose level (see \nsection 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose \nis 100 mg/m2.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in older \nchildren and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients  appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly patients.  \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n  \nLactose  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC).  \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord should \nbe administered without food.  \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of child bearing should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while they \nare receiving TMZ.  \n\n\n\n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, \nteratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). TMZ should not be \nadministered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should be \napprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ.  \n \nMale fertility  \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior \nto treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nClinical trial experience \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4. \nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed \nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common \n\n\n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse events were \ncombined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil \nabnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nthrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the patients \nwho received TMZ.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19% and 17% respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8% and \n4%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir \nbetween Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of \nbleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia \n\n\n\n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3%, in women vs men in \nthe first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in \n8% of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% of female vs 3% of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3% of female vs 0% of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although the \ndata is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, over \n5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, multi-\norgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for more \nthan 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse reactions reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In the \nevent of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be provided as \nnecessary. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the active \nmonomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be due \nprimarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at the N7 \nposition. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of the methyl \nadduct.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day of \nRT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  \n \n\n\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in the \nRT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < \n0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs 10%) \nis higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated a \nstatistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \nFigure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  \n\nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance status \n(WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. However, \nno unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status [KPS] \n≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral TMZ. \nOne was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the other was a \nrandomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67% received prior \ntreatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint was progression-\nfree survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-comparative trial, the \nPFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 months, and the median overall \nsurvival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI scans was 8%.  \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ \nand procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) (chi-square p = \n0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS ≥ 80.  \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time to \nworsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).  \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the treatment \nof patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The median PFS was \n5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the central reviewer \n\n\n\nassessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) n=162. In 43 patients \nstable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT population was 44% with a \nmedian event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results for the progression-free \nsurvival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were similar. Achieving a radiological \nobjective response or maintaining progression-free status was strongly associated with maintained or \nimproved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance to \nTMZ is similar to adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-1-\nyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Relative \nto the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of \nMTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached as \nearly as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% \nindicating complete absorption.  \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with highly \nprotein-bound substances.  \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses rapidly the blood-brain barrier and \nis present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC of \nTMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine \nover 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide \n(AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) \nwas 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n\n\n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, testes, \nthe gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and dogs tested, \ndegeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, except for \nadverse reactions on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because the doses \nimplicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect has been \nobserved in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. Dose-\nrelated reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A variety of \nneoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell adenoma were \nobserved in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were evident in dog studies. \nRats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the occurrence of first tumours \nwithin 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even for an alkylating agent.  \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCapsule contents  \nAnhydrous lactose  \nColloidal anhydrous silica \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nTartaric acid \nStearic acid  \n \nCapsule shell: \nGelatine  \nWater  \nTitanium dioxide (E171)  \nIron oxide yellow (E172) \n \nPrinting ink \n \nShellac \nPropylene glycol \nBlack iron oxide (E172) \nPotassium hydroxide \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years.  \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBottle \nDo not store above 25°C.  \nStore in the original bottle in order to protect from moisture. \n\n\n\nKeep the bottle tightly closed.  \n \nSachet \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBottle \nType III amber glass bottles with polypropylene child-resistant closures and a desiccant, containing 5 or \n20 capsules.  \nThe carton contains one bottle. \n \nSachet \nPolyester/aluminium/polyethylene (PET/alu/PE) sachet.  \nEach sachet contains 1 hard capsule.  \nPack-size of 5 or 20 hard capsules individually sealed in sachets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions fordisposable and other handling \n \nCapsules should not be opened.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTemozolomide Accord 100 mg hard capsules. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 100 mg temozolomide. \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach hard capsule contains 73 mg of anhydrous lactose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule.  \n \nThe hard capsules are pink/white hard gelatin capsules, imprinted ‘TMZ’ on cap & ‘100’ on body. \n \nEach capsule is approximately 15 mm in length. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  \n-  adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n-  children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours.  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or discontinuation \nof TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and non-haematological \ntoxicity criteria.  TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to \n49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  \n- thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  \n\n\n\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting). \n\n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1.TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during \n concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count ≥ 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological toxicity \n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) \n\n \nCTC Grade 2 \n\n \nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \nabsolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \ntoxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n\n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of \nmonotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by \n23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-\nhaematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not \nescalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. Once escalated, the dose \nremains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs. \nDose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should be applied according to \nTables 2 and 3.  \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n\n\n\n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there is \nno haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. \nExperience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients.  \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is not \naffected by age. However, elderly patients (>70  years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accordshould be administered in the fasting state.  \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n  \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections (such \nas HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule were \nshown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovrcci  pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they are \nto continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤1.  \n \n\n\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely \nfor the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have been \nreported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other steroids. \n \nHBV \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been reported. \nExperts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with positive \nhepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be monitored \nand managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If abnormal, \nphysicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the potential for fatal \nhepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway \nduring this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. For \npatients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the benefit/risk of \ncontinuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with \ntemozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it   \nis strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may require \nanti-emetic therapy.  \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which \nmay result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, \nexposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, the following \nlaboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l. A complete blood \ncount should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and \nweekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the \n\n\n\nplatelet count is < 50 x109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced one dose level (see \nsection 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose \nis 100 mg/m2.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in older \nchildren and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients  appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly patients.  \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n  \nLactose  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC).  \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord should \nbe administered without food.  \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n\n\n\n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, \nteratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide Accord should \nnot be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ.  \n \nMale fertility  \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior \nto treatment. because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influences on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nClinical trial experience \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4. \n \nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed \nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common \n\n\n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse events were \ncombined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil \nabnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nthrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the patients \nwho received TMZ.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19% and 17% respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8% and \n4%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir \nbetween Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of \nbleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia \n\n\n\n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3%, in women vs men in \nthe first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in \n8% of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% of female vs 3% of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3% of female vs 0% of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although the \ndata is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, over \n5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, multi-\norgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for more \nthan 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse reaction reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In the \nevent of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be provided as \nnecessary. \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the active \nmonomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be due \nprimarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at the N7 \nposition. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of the methyl \nadduct.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day of \nRT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in the \nRT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  \n\n\n\n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < \n0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs 10%) \nis higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated a \nstatistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \nFigure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  \n\n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance status \n(WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. However, \nno unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status [KPS] \n≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral TMZ. \nOne was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the other was a \nrandomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67% received prior \ntreatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint was progression-\nfree survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-comparative trial, the \nPFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 months, and the median overall \nsurvival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI scans was 8%.  \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ \nand procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) (chi-square p = \n0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS ≥ 80.  \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time to \nworsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).  \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the treatment \nof patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The median PFS was \n5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the central reviewer \nassessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat-population (ITT) n=162. In 43 patients \nstable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT population was 44% with a \n\n\n\nmedian event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results for the progression-free \nsurvival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were similar. Achieving a radiological \nobjective response or maintaining progression-free status was strongly associated with maintained or \nimproved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance to \nTMZ is similar to adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-1-\nyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Relative \nto the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of \nMTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached as \nearly as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% \nindicating complete absorption.  \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with highly \nprotein-bound substances.  \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses rapidly the blood-brain barrier and \nis present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC of \nTMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine \nover 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide \n(AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) \nwas 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, testes, \nthe gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and dogs tested, \ndegeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, except for \nadverse reactions on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because the doses \nimplicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect has been \nobserved in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. Dose-\nrelated reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A variety of \nneoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell adenoma were \nobserved in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were evident in dog studies. \nRats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the occurrence of first tumours \nwithin 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even for an alkylating agent.  \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCapsule contents  \nAnhydrous lactose  \nColloidal anhydrous silica \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nTartaric acid \nStearic acid  \n \nCapsule shell: \nGelatine  \nWater  \nTitanium dioxide (E171)  \nIron oxide red (E172) \n \nPrinting ink \n \nShellac \nPropylene glycol \nBlack iron oxide (E172) \nPotassium hydroxide \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years.  \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBottle \nDo not store above 25°C.  \nStore in the original bottle in order to protect from moisture. \nKeep the bottle tightly closed.  \n\n\n\n \nSachet \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBottle \nType III amber glass bottles with polypropylene child-resistant closures and a desiccant, containing 5 or \n20 capsules.  \nThe carton contains one bottle.  \n \nSachet \nPolyester/aluminium/polyethylene (PET/alu/PE) sachet.  \nEach sachet contains 1 hard capsule.  \nPack-size of  5 or 20 hard capsules individually sealed in sachets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nCapsules should not be opened.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  \n-  adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n-  children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours.  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or discontinuation \nof TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and non-haematological \ntoxicity criteria.  TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to \n49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  \n\n\n\n- thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1.TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during \n concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count ≥ 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological toxicity \n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) \n\n \nCTC Grade 2 \n\n \nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \nabsolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \ntoxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n\n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of \nmonotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by \n23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-\nhaematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not \nescalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. Once escalated, the dose \nremains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs. \nDose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should be applied according to \nTables 2 and 3.  \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there is \nno haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. \nExperience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients.  \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is not \naffected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should be administered in the fasting state.  \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n  \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections (such \nas HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42 day schedule were \nshown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, prophylaxis \nagainst PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 day regimen (with \n\n\n\na maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they are to continue the \nprophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤1.  \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely \nfor the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have been \nreported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other steroids. \n \nHBV \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been reported. \nExperts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with positive \nhepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be monitored \nand managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If abnormal, \nphysicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the potential for fatal \nhepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway \nduring this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. For \npatients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the benefit/risk of \ncontinuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with \ntemozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy  \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it   \nis strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may require \nanti-emetic therapy.  \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which \nmay result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, \nexposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, the following \n\n\n\nlaboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l. A complete blood \ncount should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and \nweekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the \nplatelet count is < 50 x109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced one dose level (see \nsection 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose \nis 100 mg/m2.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in older \nchildren and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients  appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly patients.  \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n  \nLactose  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC).  \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord should \nbe administered without food.  \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n\n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, \nteratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide Accord should \nnot be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ.  \n \nMale fertility  \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior \nto treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nClinical trial experience \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.  \nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed \nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common \n\n\n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse events were \ncombined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil \nabnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nthrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the patients \nwho received TMZ.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19% and 17% respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8% and \n4%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir \nbetween Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of \nbleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia \n\n\n\n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3%, in women vs men in \nthe first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in \n8% of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% of female vs 3% of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3% of female vs 0% of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although the \ndata is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse events after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, over \n5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, multi-\norgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for more \nthan 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse reactions reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In the \nevent of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be provided as \nnecessary. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the active \nmonomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be due \nprimarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at the N7 \nposition. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of the methyl \nadduct.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day of \nRT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis  jirovecii \npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  \n \n\n\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in the \nRT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < \n0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs 10%) \nis higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated a \nstatistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \nFigure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  \n\n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance status \n(WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. However, \nno unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status [KPS] \n≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral TMZ. \nOne was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the other was a \nrandomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67% received prior \ntreatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint was progression-\nfree survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-comparative trial, the \nPFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 months, and the median overall \nsurvival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI scans was 8%.  \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ \nand procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) (chi-square p = \n0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS ≥ 80.  \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time to \nworsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).  \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the treatment \nof patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The median PFS was \n\n\n\n5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the central reviewer \nassessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat-population (ITT) n=162. In 43 patients \nstable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT population was 44% with a \nmedian event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results for the progression-free \nsurvival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were similar. Achieving a radiological \nobjective response or maintaining progression-free status was strongly associated with maintained or \nimproved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance to \nTMZ is similar to adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-1-\nyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Relative \nto the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of \nMTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached as \nearly as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% \nindicating complete absorption.  \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with highly \nprotein-bound substances.  \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses rapidly the blood-brain barrier and \nis present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC of \nTMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine \nover 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide \n(AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n \n\n\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) \nwas 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, testes, \nthe gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and dogs tested, \ndegeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, except for \nadverse reactions on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because the doses \nimplicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect has been \nobserved in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. Dose-\nrelated reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A variety of \nneoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell adenoma were \nobserved in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were evident in dog studies. \nRats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the occurrence of first tumours \nwithin 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even for an alkylating agent.  \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCapsule contents  \nAnhydrous lactose  \nColloidal anhydrous silica \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nTartaric acid \nStearic acid  \n \nCapsule shell: \nGelatine  \nWater  \nTitanium dioxide (E171)  \nIndigo carmine (E132). \n \nPrinting ink \n \nShellac \nPropylene glycol \nBlack iron oxide (E172) \nPotassium hydroxide \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years.  \n \n \n\n\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBottle \nDo not store above 25°C.  \nStore in the original bottle in order to protect from moisture.  \nKeep the bottle tightly closed.  \n \nSachet \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBottle \nType III amber glass bottles with polypropylene child-resistant closures and a desiccant, containing 5 or \n20 capsules.  \nThe carton contains one bottle.  \n \nSachet \nPolyester/aluminium/polyethylene (PET/alu/PE) sachet.  \nEach sachet contains 1 hard capsule.  \nPack-size of  5 or 20 hard capsules individually sealed in sachets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nCapsules should not be opened.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  \n-  adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n-  children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours.  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or discontinuation \nof temozolomide administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and non-\nhaematological toxicity criteria.  TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  \n\n\n\n- thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.  \n \n \n\nTable 1.TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during \n concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count ≥ 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological toxicity \n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) \n\n \nCTC Grade 2 \n\n \nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \nabsolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \ntoxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n\n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of \nmonotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by \n23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-\nhaematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not \nescalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. Once escalated, the dose \nremains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs. \nDose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should be applied according to \nTables 2 and 3.  \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there is \nno haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. \nExperience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients.  \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is not \naffected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should be administered in the fasting state.  \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n  \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections (such \nas HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecci pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule were \nshown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, prophylaxis \nagainst PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 day regimen (with \n\n\n\na maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they are to continue the \nprophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤1.  \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely \nfor the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have been \nreported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other steroids. \n \nHBV \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been reported. \nExperts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with positive \nhepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be monitored \nand managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If abnormal, \nphysicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the potential for fatal \nhepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway \nduring this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. For \npatients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the benefit/risk of \ncontinuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with \ntemozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy  \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it  \nis strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may require \nanti-emetic therapy.  \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which \nmay result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, \nexposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, the following \n\n\n\nlaboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l. A complete blood \ncount should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and \nweekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the \nplatelet count is < 50 x109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced one dose level (see \nsection 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose \nis 100 mg/m2.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in older \nchildren and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients  appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly patients.  \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n  \nLactose  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC).  \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord should \nbe administered without food.  \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n\n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, \nteratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide Accord should \nnot be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ.  \n \nMale fertility  \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior \nto treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nClinical trial experience \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic adverse \nreactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after \nTable 4. For patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were \nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed \nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common \n\n\n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse events were \ncombined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil \nabnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nthrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the patients \nwho received TMZ.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19% and 17% respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8% and \n4%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir \nbetween Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of \nbleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia \n\n\n\n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3%, in women vs men in \nthe first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in \n8% of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% of female vs 3% of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3% of female vs 0% of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although the \ndata is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse events after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, over \n5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, multi-\norgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for more \nthan 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse reactions reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In the \nevent of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be provided as \nnecessary. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the active \nmonomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be due \nprimarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at the N7 \nposition. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of the methyl \nadduct.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day of \nRT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  \n \n\n\n\nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in the \nRT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < \n0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs 10%) \nis higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated a \nstatistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \nFigure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  \n\n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance status \n(WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. However, \nno unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status [KPS] \n≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral TMZ. \nOne was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the other was a \nrandomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67% received prior \ntreatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint was progression-\nfree survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the non-comparative trial, the \nPFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 months, and the median overall \nsurvival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI scans was 8%.  \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ \nand procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) (chi-square p = \n0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS ≥ 80.  \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time to \nworsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).  \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the treatment \nof patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The median PFS was \n\n\n\n5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the central reviewer \nassessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat-population (ITT) population n=162. In \n43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT population was 44% \nwith a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results for the progression-free \nsurvival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were similar. Achieving a radiological \nobjective response or maintaining progression-free status was strongly associated with maintained or \nimproved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance to \nTMZ is similar to adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-1-\nyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Relative \nto the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In vivo, the t1/2 of \nMTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached as \nearly as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% \nindicating complete absorption.  \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with highly \nprotein-bound substances.  \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses  rapidly the blood-brain barrier and \nis present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC of \nTMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine \nover 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide \n(AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n \n\n\n\nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) \nwas 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, testes, \nthe gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and dogs tested, \ndegeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, except for \nadverse reactions on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because the doses \nimplicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect has been \nobserved in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. Dose-\nrelated reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A variety of \nneoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell adenoma were \nobserved in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were evident in dog studies. \nRats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the occurrence of first tumours \nwithin 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even for an alkylating agent.  \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCapsule contents  \nAnhydrous lactose  \nColloidal anhydrous silica \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nTartaric acid \nStearic acid  \n \nCapsule shell: \nGelatine  \nWater  \nTitanium dioxide (E171)  \nIron oxide yellow (E172)  \nIron oxide red (E172) \n \nPrinting ink \n \nShellac \nPropylene glycol \nBlack iron oxide (E172) \nPotassium hydroxide \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years.  \n \n\n\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBottle \nDo not store above 25°C.  \nStore in the original bottle in order to protect from moisture.  \nKeep the bottle tightly closed.  \n \nSachet \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBottle \nType III amber glass bottles with polypropylene child-resistant closures and a desiccant, containing 5 or \n20 capsules. \nThe carton contains one bottle.  \n \nSachet \nPolyester/aluminium/polyethylene (PET/alu/PE) sachet.  \nEach sachet contains 1 hard capsule.  \nPack-size of 5 or 20 hard capsules individually sealed in sachets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nCapsules should not be opened.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide Accord is indicated for the treatment of:  \n-  adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n-  children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours.  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide Accord is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy \n(60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or discontinuation \nof TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and non-haematological \ntoxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to \n49 days) if all of the following conditions are met:  \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/l  \n- thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l  \n\n\n\n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \nnausea and vomiting). \n\n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1.  \n \n \n\nTable 1.TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during \n concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \n\nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count ≥ 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological toxicity \n(except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting) \n\n \nCTC Grade 2 \n\n \nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \nabsolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count ≥ 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \ntoxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n\n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of \nmonotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by \n23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if the CTC non-\nhaematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is ≥ 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not \nescalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent cycles. Once escalated, the dose \nremains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs. \nDose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase should be applied according to \nTables 2 and 3.  \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day treatment \n\n\n\ninterruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial dose is \n150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days if there is \nno haematological toxicity (see section 4.4)  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. \nExperience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child's Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients.  \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is not \naffected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide Accord should be administered in the fasting state.  \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n  \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections (such \nas HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule were \nshown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, prophylaxis \nagainst PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42 day regimen (with \na maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they are to continue the \nprophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade ≤1.  \n \n\n\n\nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely \nfor the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have been \nreported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other steroids. \n \nHBV \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been reported. \nExperts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with positive \nhepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be monitored \nand managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If abnormal, \nphysicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the potential for fatal \nhepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway \nduring this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. For \npatients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the benefit/risk of \ncontinuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with \ntemozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8).  \n \nAnti-emetic therapy  \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ.  \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ.  \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it   \nis strongly recommended during the monotherapy phase.  \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma  \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may require \nanti-emetic therapy.  \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which \nmay result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, \nexposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, the following \nlaboratory parameters must be met: ANC ≥1.5 x 109/l and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l. A complete blood \ncount should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and \nweekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If ANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the \n\n\n\nplatelet count is < 50 x109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced one dose level (see \nsection 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose \nis 100 mg/m2.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in older \nchildren and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients  appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly patients.  \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n  \nLactose  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC).  \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide Accord should \nbe administered without food.  \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n\n\n\n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2, \nteratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide Accord should \nnot be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the patient should \nbe apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ.  \n \n \nMale fertility  \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior \nto treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nClinical trial experience \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ in clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, and rash. Most haematologic \nadverse reactions were reported commonly; the frequency of Grade 3-4 laboratory findings is \npresented after Table 4.  \nFor patients with recurrent or progressive glioma, nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %) were usually \nGrade 1 or 2 (0 – 5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported from post-marketing use of TMZ are listed \nin Table 4. These reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); Common \n\n\n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of the \npatients who received TMZ.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19% and 17% respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8% and \n4%, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the nadir \nbetween Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection.  \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and \n169 male subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male \n\n\n\n85\n\nsubjects for whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 \nneutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l), 12% vs 5%, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l), 9% vs 3%, in \nwomen vs men in the first cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 8% of female vs 4% of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% of \nfemale vs 3% of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly \ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3% of female vs 0% of male \nsubjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1% of female vs 0% of male subjects in the first cycle of \ntherapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmulti-organ failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse reactions reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents - Other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme  \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150 – 200 mg/m2) on Days 1 - 5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting \n\n\n\n86\n\n4 weeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy.  \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57%) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22%) in the TMZ + RT arm.  \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33 -1.91) with a log-rank p < \n0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26% vs \n10%) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1).  \n \n\n \nFigure 1      Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population)  \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group.  \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] ≥70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29% received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs. procarbazine in a total of 225 patients \n(67% received prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary \nendpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnon-comparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19%, the median progression-free survival was \n2.1 months, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on \nMRI scans was 8%.  \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21% vs. 8%, respectively – chi-square p = 0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and \n1.88 months respectively (log rank p = 0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for \nTMZ and procarbazine, respectively (log rank p = 0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving \npatients was significantly higher in the TMZ arm (60%) compared with the procarbazine arm (44%) \n(chi-square p = 0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a \nKPS ≥ 80.  \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \n\n\n\n87\n\nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p = < 0.01 to 0.03).  \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46%. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35% (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat-populations (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44% with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4% and 23%, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post administration (mean times between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8% \nindicating complete absorption.  \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10% to 20%), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances.  \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses rapidly, the blood-brain barrier \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30% of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5% to 10% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites.  \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose.  \n \n\n\n\n88\n\nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60% to 100% of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse reactions on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, \nbecause the doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable \neffect has been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance.  \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent.  \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCapsule contents  \nAnhydrous lactose  \nColloidal anhydrous silica \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nTartaric acid \nStearic acid  \n \nCapsule shell: \nGelatine  \nWater  \nTitanium dioxide (E171) \n \nPrinting ink \n \nShellac \nPropylene glycol \nBlack iron oxide (E172) \nPotassium hydroxide \n \n \n\n\n\n89\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n 2 years.  \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBottle \nDo not store above 25°C.  \nStore in the original bottle in order to protect from moisture.  \nKeep the bottle tightly closed. \n \nSachet \nDo not store above 25 °C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nBottle \nType III amber glass bottles with polypropylene child-resistant closures and a desiccant, containing 5 \nor 20 capsules.  \nThe carton contains one bottle.  \n \nSachet \nPolyester/aluminium/polyethylene (PET/alu/PE) sachet.  \nEach sachet contains 1 hard capsule.  \nPack-size of 5 or 20 hard capsules individually sealed in sachets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nCapsules should not be opened.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Temozolomide Accord is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Temozolomide Accord is and what it is used for \n \nTemozolomide is an anti-cancer medicine. \n \nTemozolomide Accord capsules are taken to treat specific forms of brain tumours: \n- adults with newly diagnosed specific form of brain tumour (glioblastoma multiforme). \n\nTemozolomide is first used together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and \nafter that alone (monotherapy phase of treatment).  \n\n- children 3 years and older and adult patients with specific forms of brain tumour (e.g. \nglioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic. astrocytoma) that has returned or where the cancer has \nspread after standard therapy. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide Accord  \n \nDo not take Temozolomide Accord \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to another anti-cancer medicine called dacarbazine. Signs of \n\nallergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of the face, lips, \ntongue or throat. \n\n- if you have a reduced number of blood cells, such as your white \nblood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and \nfor proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of \nthese cells before you begin treatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide Accord,  \n \n\n\n\n133\n\n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infectioncalled \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient (glioblastoma \nmultiforme) you may be receiving temozolomide  for 42 days in combination with radiotherapy. \nIn this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this typeof pneumonia \n(PCP). \n \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide \nAccord could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. \nPatients will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment. \n \n\n- if you have anaemia, low blood count (such as white blood cell count and platelet count), or \nblood clotting problems before treatment, or develop them during treatment. Your doctor may \nneed to reduce the dose of your medicine or interrupt your treatment, or you may need other \ntreatment. Your doctor will decide whether any change in your treatment is needed. In some \ncases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with temozolomide. Your blood will be tested \nregularly to monitor your condition.  If you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n \n- you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n \n- if you feel sick or vomit, which are very common side effects of Temozolomide (see section 4). \n\nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about medicines to help \nprevent vomiting or control the vomiting and the best time to take temozolomide until the \nvomiting is under control. If you vomit after your dose, do not take a second dose on the same \nday. \n\n \n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n- if you are older than 70 years of age.  Older patients are more prone to infections, increased \n\nbruising or bleeding.   \n \n- if you have liver or kidney problems as your dose of temozolomide may need to be adjusted.   \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide Accord. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy,breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide Accord during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide Accord (see also “Male fertility” below). \n \nYou must not breast-feed whilst you are being treated with Temozolomide Accord. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide Accord may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective \ncontraception and not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to \nseek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n  \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine.    \n\n\n\n134\n\n \nDriving and using machines \nWhen you take temozolomide you may feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools \nor machines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \nTemozolomide Accord contains lactose \nThe capsules contain lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide Accord  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHow to open sachet  \nOpen the sachet by folding and tearing along the fold line with the notch in the corner of the sachet. \n \nTemozolomide should only be prescribed by specialists experienced in brain tumours. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment  \n \nYour doctor will decide the correct dose of temozolomide for you to take, based on your size (height \nand weight) and whether you have had chemotherapy treatment. You may be given other medicines to \ntake before and/or after temozolomide to avoid or control vomiting. \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide Accord once a day. Take the dose on an empty stomach; \nfor example, at least one hour before you plan to eat breakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a \nglass of water.  Do not open, crush or chew the capsules.   \n \nIf a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. Avoid inhaling the \npowder. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  \n \nIf you are taking Temozolomide Accord in combination with radiotherapy (newly diagnosed \npatients): \n \nWhile the radiotherapy is ongoing your doctor will start temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m² and the \nactual daily dose you take will depend on your height and weight. You will take this dose every day \nfor 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. Based on your blood counts and how \nyou tolerate temozolomide, the dose may be delayed or stopped. \n \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks to give your body a \nchance to recover. \n \nThen there may be up to 6 treatment cycles, and each one lasts 28 days. You will take your new dose \nof temozolomide capsules initially at 150 mg/m² once daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) of \neach cycle, followed by 23 days without temozolomide; this adds up to a 28 day treatment cycle.  \n \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin, in which you will again take this medicine once daily for five \ndays followed by 23 days without temozolomide. Based on your blood counts and how you tolerate \ntemozolomide during each treatment cycle, the dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped. \n \nIf you are taking Temozolomide Accord capsules alone (without radiotherapy): \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide Accord comprises 28 days. You will take the capsules once \ndaily for the first five days (“dosing days”) followed by 23 days without temozolomide, adding up to \nthe 28 day treatment cycle.  \n\n\n\n135\n\n \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin, in which you will again take this medicine once daily for five \ndays followed by 23 days without temozolomide. Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be \ntested to see if the temozolomide dose needs to be adjusted. \n \nIf you have not been treated before with chemotherapy, you will take your first dose of temozolomide \nat 200 mg/m² once daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) followed by 23 days without \ntemozolomide. If you have been treated before with chemotherapy, you will take your first dose of \ntemozolomide at 150 mg/m² once daily for the first five days (“dosing days”) followed by 23 days \nwithout temozolomide. \n \nDepending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle. \nEach time you start a new treatment cycle, be sure you understand exactly how many capsules of each \nstrength you need to take each day and how many days you will receive this dose. \n \nAll patients \n \nTemozolomide comes in different strength capsules (shown on the outer label in mg). Each strength \nhas a different colour cap. Depending on the dose of temozolomide that your doctor prescribes, you \nmay have to take several capsules on each dosing day of the treatment cycle. \n- Be sure you understand exactly how many capsules you need to take of each strength. Ask your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist to write down the number of each strength (including colour) that you need \nto take each dosing day. \n\n- Be sure you know exactly which days are your dosing days. \n- Be sure you review the dose with your health care provider each time you start a new cycle. \n\nSometimes the dose or the mix of capsules you need to take will be different from the last cycle. \n- Once you take the medicine home, if you are confused or unsure about how to take your dose, \n\ncall for re-instruction before beginning the treatment cycle. Errors in how you take this \nmedicine may have serious health consequences. \n\n \nIf you take more Temozolomide Accord than you should \nIf you accidentally take more capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse \nimmediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Temozolomide Accord \nTake the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with \nyour doctor. Do not double the next dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you \nto do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPatients taking temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy may experience different side \neffects than patients taking temozolomide alone. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: \n-  a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitive) (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty),  \n- uncontrolled bleeding, \n- Seizures (convulsions),  \n- fever,  \n- chills, \n- severe headache that does not go away. \n \n\n\n\n136\n\nTemozolomide treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells.
