PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nInvokana 100 mg film-coated tablets\n\nThe tablet is yellow, capsule-shaped, approximately 11 mm in length, immediate-release and \nfilm-coated, with \u201cCFZ\u201d on one side and \u201c100\u201d on the other side.\n\nInvokana 300 mg film-coated tablets\n\nThe tablet is white, capsule-shaped, approximately 17 mm in length, immediate-release and \nfilm-coated, with \u201cCFZ\u201d on one side and \u201c300\u201d on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nInvokana is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus \nas an adjunct to diet and exercise:\n\n- as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or \ncontraindications\n\n- in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.\n\nFor study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control, cardiovascular \nand renal events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended starting dose of canagliflozin is 100 mg once daily. In patients tolerating \ncanagliflozin 100 mg once daily who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate \n(eGFR) \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl \u2265 60 mL/min and need tighter glycaemic control, the dose can \nbe increased to 300 mg once daily (see section 4.4). For dose adjustment recommendations according \nto eGFR refer to table 1.\n\nCare should be taken when increasing the dose in patients \u2265 75 years of age, patients with known \ncardiovascular disease, or other patients for whom the initial canagliflozin-induced diuresis poses a \nrisk (see section 4.4). In patients with evidence of volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to \ninitiation of canagliflozin is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen canagliflozin is used as add-on therapy with insulin or an insulin secretagogue \n(e.g., sulphonylurea), a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue may be considered to reduce \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)\nRenal function and risk of volume depletion should be taken into account (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nFor treatment of diabetic kidney disease as add on to standard of care (eg ACE-inhibitors or ARBs), a \ndose of 100 mg canagliflozin once daily should be used (see table 1). Because the glycaemic lowering \nefficacy of canagliflozin is reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in \npatients with severe renal impairment, if further glycaemic control is needed, the addition of other \nanti-hyperglycaemic agents should be considered. For dose adjustment recommendations according to \neGFR refer to table 1.\n\nTable 1: Dose adjustment recommendationsa\n\neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)\nor CrCl (mL/min)\n\nTotal daily dose of canagliflozin\n\n\u2265 60\n\nInitiate with 100 mg.\n\nIn patients tolerating 100 mg and requiring additional \nglycaemic control, the dose can be increased to 300 mg.\n\n45 to < 60b\nInitiate with 100 mg.\n\nContinue 100 mg for patients already taking Invokana.\n\n30 to < 45b, c\nInitiate with 100 mg.\n\nContinue 100 mg for patients already taking Invokana.\n\n< 30b, c\nContinue 100 mg for patients already taking Invokanad.\n\nInvokana should not be initiated.\na See sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.\nb If further glycaemic control is needed, the addition of other anti hyperglycaemic agents should be considered\nc With urinary albumin/creatinine ratio \u02c3 300 mg/g\nd Continue dosing until dialysis or renal transplantation.\n\nHepatic impairment\nFor patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required.\n\n\n\n4\n\nCanagliflozin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended \nfor use in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in children under 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor oral use\nInvokana should be taken orally once a day, preferably before the first meal of the day. Tablets should \nbe swallowed whole.\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers; however, a double dose \nshould not be taken on the same day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe efficacy of canagliflozin for glycaemic control is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is \nreduced in patients who have moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nIn patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl < 60 mL/min, a higher incidence of adverse \nreactions associated with volume depletion (e.g., postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, \nhypotension) was reported, particularly with the 300 mg dose. In addition, in such patients more \nevents of elevated potassium and greater increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) \nwere reported (see section 4.8).\n\nTherefore, the canagliflozin dose should be limited to 100 mg once daily in patients with \neGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl < 60 mL/min (see section 4.2).\n\nRegardless of pretreatment eGFR, patients on canagliflozin experienced an initial fall in eGFR that \nthereafter attenuated over time (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as follows:\n- Prior to initiation of canagliflozin and at least annually, thereafter (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and \n\n5.2)\n- Prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and \n\nperiodically thereafter.\n\nUse in patients at risk for adverse reactions related to volume depletion\n\nDue to its mechanism of action, canagliflozin, by increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE) induces \nan osmotic diuresis, which may reduce intravascular volume and decrease blood pressure (see \nsection 5.1). In controlled clinical studies of canagliflozin, increases in adverse reactions related to \nvolume depletion (e.g., postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) were seen more \ncommonly with the 300 mg dose and occurred most frequently in the first three months (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients for whom a canagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could \npose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients with an \n\n\n\n5\n\neGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension, \npatients on diuretics, or elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nDue to volume depletion, generally small mean decreases in eGFR were seen within the first 6 weeks \nof treatment initiation with canagliflozin. In patients susceptible to greater reductions in intravascular \nvolume as described above, larger decreases in eGFR (> 30%) were sometimes seen, which \nsubsequently improved, and infrequently required interruption of treatment with canagliflozin (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nPatients should be advised to report symptoms of volume depletion. Canagliflozin is not recommended \nfor use in patients receiving loop diuretics (see section 4.5) or who are volume depleted, e.g., due to\nacute illness (such as gastrointestinal illness).\n\nFor patients receiving canagliflozin, in case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume \ndepletion (such as a gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g., physical \nexamination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including renal function tests), and serum \nelectrolytes is recommended. Temporary interruption of treatment with canagliflozin may be \nconsidered for patients who develop volume depletion while on canagliflozin therapy until the \ncondition is corrected. If interrupted, consideration should be given to more frequent glucose\nmonitoring.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\n\nRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been \nreported in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin. In a number of cases, the \npresentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below \n14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of \ncanagliflozin. Risk of DKA appears to be higher in patients with moderately to severely decreased \nrenal function who require insulin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual\nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with canagliflozin should be discontinued \nimmediately.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with canagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating canagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should \nbe considered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g., \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or \npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and \ncanagliflozin should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from \nclinical studies suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes \nare treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nLower limb amputations\n\nIn long-term clinical studies of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes with established \ncardiovascular disease (CVD) or at least 2 risk factors for CVD, Invokana was associated with an \nincreased risk of lower limb amputation versus placebo (0.63 vs 0.34 events per 100 patient-years, \nrespectively), and this increase occurred primarily in the toe and midfoot (see section 4.8). In a \nlong-term clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease, no difference in \nlower limb amputation risk was observed in patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg relative to \nplacebo. In this study precautionary measures as outlined below were applied. As an underlying \nmechanism has not been established, risk factors, apart from general risk factors, for amputation are \nunknown.\n\nBefore initiating Invokana, consider factors in the patient history that may increase the risk for \namputation. As precautionary measures, consideration should be given to carefully monitoring patients \nwith a higher risk for amputation events and counselling patients about the importance of routine \npreventative foot care and maintaining adequate hydration. Consideration may also be given to \nstopping treatment with Invokana in patients who develop events which may precede amputation such \nas lower-extremity skin ulcer, infection, osteomyelitis or gangrene.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\n\nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier's gangrene), \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and \npotentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier's \ngangrene is suspected, Invokana should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics \nand surgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nElevated haematocrit\n\nHaematocrit increase was observed with canagliflozin treatment (see section 4.8); therefore, careful \nmonitoring in patients with already elevated haematocrit is warranted.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)\n\nElderly patients may be at a greater risk for volume depletion, are more likely to be treated with \ndiuretics, and to have impaired renal function. In patients \u2265 75 years of age, a higher incidence of \nadverse reactions associated with volume depletion (e.g., postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, \nhypotension) was reported. In addition, in such patients greater decreases in eGFR were reported (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nGenital mycotic infections\n\nConsistent with the mechanism of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition with increased \nUGE, vulvovaginal candidiasis in females and balanitis or balanoposthitis in males were reported in \nclinical studies with canagliflozin (see section 4.8). Male and female patients with a history of genital \nmycotic infections were more likely to develop an infection. Balanitis or balanoposthitis occurred \nprimarily in uncircumcised male patients which in some instances resulted in phimosis and/or\ncircumcision. The majority of genital mycotic infections were treated with topical antifungal \n\n\n\n7\n\ntreatments, either prescribed by a healthcare professional or self-treated while continuing therapy with \nInvokana.\n\nCardiac failure\n\nExperience in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III is limited, and there is no experience in \nclinical studies with canagliflozin in NYHA class IV.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\n\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking canagliflozin will test positive for glucose in their \nurine.\n\nLactose intolerance\n\nThe tablets contain lactose.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nDiuretics\n\nCanagliflozin may add to the effect of diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and \nhypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, can cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a \nlower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia \nwhen used in combination with canagliflozin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on canagliflozin\n\nThe metabolism of canagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP \nglucuronosyl transferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) and 2B4 (UGT2B4). Canagliflozin is transported by \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP).\n\nEnzyme inducers (such as St. John\u2019s wort [Hypericum perforatum], rifampicin, barbiturates, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, ritonavir, efavirenz) may give rise to decreased exposure of canagliflozin. \nFollowing co-administration of canagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters \nand medicinal product-metabolising enzymes), 51% and 28% decreases in canagliflozin systemic \nexposure (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) were observed. These decreases in exposure to \ncanagliflozin may decrease efficacy.\n\nIf a combined inducer of these UGT enzymes and transport proteins must be co-administered with \ncanagliflozin, monitoring of glycaemic control to assess response to canagliflozin is appropriate. If an \ninducer of these UGT enzymes must be co-administered with canagliflozin, increasing the dose to \n\n\n\n8\n\n300 mg once daily may be considered if patients are currently tolerating canagliflozin 100 mg once \ndaily, have an eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl \u2265 60 mL/min, and require additional glycaemic \ncontrol. In patients with an eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl 45 mL/min to\n< 60 mL/min taking canagliflozin 100 mg who are receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT enzyme \ninducer and who require additional glycaemic control, other glucose-lowering therapies should be \nconsidered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nCholestyramine may potentially reduce canagliflozin exposure. Dosing of canagliflozin should occur \nat least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant to minimise possible \ninterference with their absorption.\n\nInteraction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin are not altered by metformin, \nhydrochlorothiazide, oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrol), ciclosporin, and/or \nprobenecid.\n\nEffects of canagliflozin on other medicinal products\n\nDigoxin\nThe combination of canagliflozin 300 mg once daily for 7 days with a single dose of digoxin 0.5 mg \nfollowed by 0.25 mg daily for 6 days resulted in a 20% increase in AUC and a 36% increase in Cmax of \ndigoxin, probably due to inhibition of P-gp. Canagliflozin has been observed to inhibit P-gp in vitro. \nPatients taking digoxin or other cardiac glycosides (e.g., digitoxin) should be monitored appropriately.\n\nDabigatran\nThe effect of concomitant administration of canagliflozin (a weak P-gp inhibitor) on dabigatran \netexilate (a P-gp substrate) has not been studied. As dabigatran concentrations may be increased in the \npresence of canagliflozin, monitoring (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) should be exercised \nwhen dabigatran is combined with canagliflozin.\n\nSimvastatin\nThe combination of canagliflozin 300 mg once daily for 6 days with a single dose of simvastatin \n(CYP3A4 substrate) 40 mg resulted in a 12% increase in AUC and a 9% increase in Cmax of \nsimvastatin and an 18% increase in AUC and a 26% increase in Cmax of simvastatin acid. The \nincreases in simvastatin and simvastatin acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant.\n\nInhibition of BCRP by canagliflozin cannot be excluded at an intestinal level and increased exposure \nmay therefore occur for medicinal products transported by BCRP, e.g. certain statins like rosuvastatin \nand some anti-cancer medicinal products.\n\nIn interaction studies, canagliflozin at steady-state had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of metformin, oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrol), \nglibenclamide, paracetamol, hydrochlorothiazide, or warfarin.\n\nMedicinal product/Laboratory test interference\n\n1,5-AG assay\n\nIncreases in urinary glucose excretion with Invokana can falsely lower 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG)\nlevels and make measurements of 1,5-AG unreliable in assessing glycaemic control. Therefore, \n1,5-AG assays should not be used for assessment of glycaemic control in patients on canagliflozin. For \nfurther detail, it may be advisable to contact the specific manufacturer of the 1,5-AG assay.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of canagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nCanagliflozin should not be used during pregnancy. When pregnancy is detected, treatment with \ncanagliflozin should be discontinued.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether canagliflozin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of canagliflozin/metabolites in \nmilk, as well as pharmacologically mediated effects in breast-feeding offspring and juvenile rats \nexposed to canagliflozin (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nCanagliflozin should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effect of canagliflozin on fertility in humans has not been studied. No effects on fertility were \nobserved in animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCanagliflozin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \npatients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when canagliflozin is used as add-on therapy \nwith insulin or an insulin secretagogue, and to the elevated risk of adverse reactions related to volume \ndepletion, such as postural dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety of canagliflozin was evaluated in 22,645 patients with type 2 diabetes, including \n13,278 patients treated with canagliflozin and 9,367 patients treated with comparator in \n15 double-blind, controlled phase 3 and phase 4 clinical studies. A total of 10,134 patients were \ntreated in two dedicated cardiovascular studies for a mean exposure duration of 149 weeks (223 weeks \nin CANVAS and 94 weeks in CANVAS-R), and 8,114 patients were treated in 12 double blind, \ncontrolled phase 3 and phase 4 clinical studies, for a mean exposure duration of 49 weeks. In a \ndedicated renal outcomes study, a total of 4,397 patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney \ndisease had a mean exposure duration of 115 weeks.\n\nThe primary assessment of safety and tolerability was conducted in a pooled analysis (n = 2,313) of \nfour 26-week placebo-controlled clinical studies (monotherapy and add-on therapy with metformin, \nmetformin and a sulphonylurea, and metformin and pioglitazone). The most commonly reported \nadverse reactions during treatment were hypoglycaemia in combination with insulin or a \nsulphonylurea, vulvovaginal candidiasis, urinary tract infection, and polyuria or pollakiuria \n(i.e., urinary frequency). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of \u2265 0.5% of all\ncanagliflozin-treated patients in these studies were vulvovaginal candidiasis (0.7% of female patients) \nand balanitis or balanoposthitis (0.5% of male patients). Additional safety analyses (including \nlong-term data) from data across the entire canagliflozin programme (placebo- and active-controlled \nstudies) were conducted to assess reported adverse reactions in order to identify adverse reactions \n(table 2) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n10\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions in table 2 are based on the pooled analysis of the placebo- and active-controlled\nstudies described above. Adverse reactions reported from world-wide postmarketing use of \ncanagliflozin are also included in this tabulation. Adverse reactions listed below are classified \naccording to frequency and system organ class. Frequency categories are defined according to the \nfollowing convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions (MedDRA) from placebo-e and \nactive-controlled studiese and from postmarketing experience\n\nSystem organ class\nFrequency\n\nAdverse reaction\n\nInfections and infestations\nvery common Vulvovaginal candidiasisb, j\n\ncommon Balanitis or balanoposthitisb, k, Urinary tract \ninfectionc (pyelonephritis and urosepsis have \nbeen reported postmarketing)\n\nnot known Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene)d\n\nImmune system disorders\nrare Anaphylactic reaction\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nvery common Hypoglycaemia in combination with insulin or \n\nsulphonylureac\n\nuncommon Dehydrationa\n\nrare Diabetic ketoacidosisb\n\nNervous system disorders\nuncommon Dizziness posturala, Syncopea\n\nVascular disorders\nuncommon Hypotensiona, Orthostatic hypotensiona\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\ncommon Constipation, Thirstf, Nausea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nuncommon Photosensitivity, Rashg, Urticaria\n\nrare Angioedema\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nuncommon Bone fractureh\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\ncommon Polyuria or Pollakiuriai\n\nuncommon Renal failure (mainly in the context of volume \ndepletion)\n\nInvestigations\ncommon Dyslipidemial, Haematocrit increasedb, m\n\nuncommon Blood creatinine increasedb, n, Blood urea \nincreasedb, o, Blood potassium increasedb, p, \nBlood phosphate increasedq\n\n\n\n11\n\nSurgical and medical procedures\nuncommon Lower limb amputations (mainly of the toe and \n\nmidfoot) especially in patients at high risk for \nheart diseaseb\n\na Related to volume depletion;

of the 14 patients with DKA, 8 (7 on canagliflozin 100 mg and 1 on placebo) had a \npretreatment eGFR of 30 to \u02c2 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see section 4.4).\n\nLower limb amputation\n\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes who had established cardiovascular disease or at least two risk factors \nfor cardiovascular disease, canagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of lower limb \namputation as observed in the Integrated CANVAS Program comprised of CANVAS and \nCANVAS-R, two large, long-term, randomised, placebo-controlled trials evaluating 10,134 patients. \nThe imbalance occurred as early as the first 26 weeks of therapy. Patients in CANVAS and \nCANVAS-R were followed for an average of 5.7 and 2.1 years, respectively. Regardless of treatment \nwith canagliflozin or placebo, the risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of \nprior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy. The risk of lower limb amputation was\nnot dose-dependent. The amputation results for the Integrated CANVAS Program are shown in \ntable 3.\n\n\n\n12\n\nThere was no difference in risk of lower limb amputations associated with the use of canagliflozin \n100 mg relative to placebo (1.2 vs 1.1 events per 100 patient-years, respectively [HR: 1.11; 95% \nCI 0.79, 1.56]) in CREDENCE, a long-term renal outcomes study of 4,397 patients with type 2\ndiabetes and diabetic kidney disease (see section 4.4). In other type 2 diabetes studies with \ncanagliflozin, which enrolled a general diabetic population of 8,114 patients, no difference in lower \nlimb amputation risk was observed relative to control.\n\nTable 3: Integrated analysis of amputations in CANVAS AND CANVAS-R\nPlacebo\nN = 4344\n\ncanagliflozin\nN = 5790\n\nTotal number of subjects with events, n \n(%)\n\n47 (1.1) 140 (2.4)\n\nIncidence rate (per 100 patient-years) 0.34 0.63\nHR (95% CI) vs. placebo 1.97 (1.41, 2.75)\nMinor Amputation, n (%)* 34/47 (72.3) 99/140 (70.7)\nMajor Amputation, n (%)\u2020 13/47 (27.7) 41/140 (29.3)\nNote: Incidence is based on the number of patients with at least one amputation, and not the total number of amputation \nevents. A patient\u2019s follow-up is calculated from Day 1 to the first amputation event date. Some patients had more than one \namputation. The percentage of minor and major amputations is based on the highest level amputation for each patient.\n* Toe and midfoot\n\u2020 Ankle, below knee and above knee\n\nOf the subjects, within the CANVAS Program, who had an amputation, the toe and midfoot were the \nmost frequent sites (71%) in both treatment groups (table 3). Multiple amputations (some involving \nboth lower limbs) were observed infrequently and in similar proportions in both treatment groups.\n\nLower limb infections, diabetic foot ulcers, peripheral arterial disease, and gangrene, were the most \ncommon medical events associated with the need for an amputation in both treatment groups (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nAdverse reactions related to volume depletion\n\nIn the pooled analysis of the four 26-week, placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of all adverse \nreactions related to volume depletion (e.g., postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, \ndehydration, and syncope) was 1.2% for canagliflozin 100 mg, 1.3% for canagliflozin 300 mg, and \n1.1% for placebo. The incidence with canagliflozin treatment in the two active-controlled studies was \nsimilar to comparators.\n\nIn one of the dedicated long-term cardiovascular studies (CANVAS), where patients were generally \nolder with a higher rate of diabetes complications, the incidence rates of adverse reactions related to \nvolume depletion were 2.3 with canagliflozin 100 mg, 2.9 with canagliflozin 300 mg, and 1.9 with \nplacebo, events per 100 patient-years.\n\nTo assess risk factors for these adverse reactions, a larger pooled analysis (N = 12,441) of patients \nfrom 13 controlled phase 3 and phase 4 studies including both doses of canagliflozin was conducted. \nIn this pooled analysis, patients on loop diuretics, patients with a baseline eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to \n< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and patients \u2265 75 years of age had generally higher incidences of these adverse \nreactions. For patients on loop diuretics, the incidence rates were 5.0 on canagliflozin 100 mg and 5.7\non canagliflozin 300 mg compared to 4.1 events per 100 patient-years of exposure in the control \ngroup. For patients with a baseline eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence\nrates were 5.2 on canagliflozin 100 mg and 5.4 on canagliflozin 300 mg compared to 3.1 events per \n100 patient-years of exposure in the control group. In patients \u2265 75 years of age, the incidence rates \nwere 5.3 on canagliflozin 100 mg and 6.1 on canagliflozin 300 mg compared to 2.4 events per \n100 patient-years of exposure in the control group (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nIn a long-term renal outcomes study in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease, \nincidence rate of events related to volume depletion was 2.84 and 2.35 events per 100 patient-years for \ncanagliflozin 100 mg and placebo, respectively. The incidence rate was observed to increase with \n\n\n\n13\n\ndecreasing eGFR. In subjects with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence rate of volume \ndepletion was higher in the canagliflozin group (4.91 events per 100 patient-years) compared to the \nplacebo group (2.60 events per 100 patient-years); however, in the subgroups eGFR \u226545 to <60 and \neGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, the between-group incidence rate was similar.\n\nIn the dedicated cardiovascular study and the larger pooled analysis, as well as in a dedicated renal \noutcomes study, discontinuations due to adverse reactions related to volume depletion and serious \nadverse reactions related to volume depletion were not increased with canagliflozin.\n\nHypoglycaemia in add-on therapy with insulin or insulin secretagogues\n\nThe frequency of hypoglycaemia was low (approximately 4%) among treatment groups, including \nplacebo, when used as monotherapy or as an add-on to metformin. When canagliflozin was added to \ninsulin therapy, hypoglycaemia was observed in 49.3%, 48.2%, and 36.8% of patients treated with \ncanagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, and placebo, respectively, and severe hypoglycaemia \noccurred in 1.8%, 2.7%, and 2.5% of patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, \nand placebo, respectively. When canagliflozin was added to a sulphonylurea therapy, hypoglycaemia \nwas observed in 4.1%, 12.5%, and 5.8% of patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin \n300 mg, and placebo, respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nGenital mycotic infections\n\nVulvovaginal candidiasis (including vulvovaginitis and vulvovaginal mycotic infection) was reported \nin 10.4% and 11.4% of female patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, \nrespectively, compared to 3.2% in placebo-treated female patients. Most reports of vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis occurred during the first four months of treatment with canagliflozin. Among female \npatients taking canagliflozin, 2.3% experienced more than one infection. Overall, 0.7% of all female \npatients discontinued canagliflozin due to vulvovaginal candidiasis (see section 4.4). In the CANVAS \nProgram, median duration of the infection was longer in the canagliflozin group compared to the \nplacebo group.\n\nCandidal balanitis or balanoposthitis occurred in male patients at a rate of 2.98 and 0.79 events per \n100 patient-years on canagliflozin and placebo, respectively. Among male patients taking \ncanagliflozin, 2.4% had more than one infection. Discontinuation of canagliflozin by male patients due \nto candidal balanitis or balanoposthitis occurred at a rate of 0.37 events per 100 patient-years.\nPhimosis was reported at a rate of 0.39 and 0.07 events per 100 patient-years on canagliflozin and \nplacebo, respectively. Circumcision was performed at rates of 0.31 and 0.09 events per \n100 patient-years on canagliflozin and placebo, respectively (see section 4.4).\n\nUrinary tract infections\n\nUrinary tract infections were more frequently reported for canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg (5.9% \nversus 4.3%, respectively) compared to 4.0% with placebo. Most infections were mild to moderate \nwith no increase in the occurrence of serious adverse reactions. Subjects responded to standard \ntreatments while continuing canagliflozin treatment.\n\nBone fracture\n\nIn a cardiovascular study (CANVAS) of 4,327 treated subjects with established or at least two risk \nfactors for cardiovascular disease, the incidence rates of all adjudicated bone fracture were 1.6, 1.8, \nand 1.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, and \nplacebo, respectively, with the fracture imbalance initially occurring within the first 26 weeks of \ntherapy.\n\nIn two other long-term studies and in studies conducted in the general diabetes population, no \ndifference in fracture risk was observed with canagliflozin relative to control. In a second \ncardiovascular study (CANVAS-R) of 5,807 treated subjects with established or at least two risk \n\n\n\n14\n\nfactors for cardiovascular disease, the incidence rates of all adjudicated bone fracture were 1.1 and \n1.3 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up to canagliflozin and placebo, respectively.\n\nIn a long-term renal outcomes study of 4,397 treated subjects with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney \ndisease, the incidence rates of all adjudicated bone fracture were 1.2 events per 100 patient-years of \nfollow-up for both canagliflozin 100 mg and placebo. In other type 2 diabetes studies with \ncanagliflozin, which enrolled a general diabetes population of 7,729 patients and where bone fractures \nwere adjudicated, the incidence rates of all adjudicated bone fracture were 1.2 and 1.1 per \n100 patient-years of follow-up to canagliflozin and control, respectively. After 104 weeks of \ntreatment, canagliflozin did not adversely affect bone mineral density.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)\nIn a pooled analysis of 13 placebo-controlled and active-controlled studies, the safety profile of \ncanagliflozin in elderly patients was generally consistent with younger patients. Patients \u2265 75 years of \nage had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion (such as postural \ndizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension) with incidence rates of 5.3, 6.1, and 2.4 events per \n100 patient-years of exposure for canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, and in the control \ngroup, respectively. Decreases in eGFR (-3.4 and -4.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) were reported with \ncanagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, compared to the control group \n(-4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2). Mean baseline eGFR was 62.5, 64.7, and 63.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 for \ncanagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, and the control group, respectively (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4).\n\nRenal impairment in patients with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus\nPatients with a baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher incidence of adverse reactions \nassociated with volume depletion (e.g., postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension) with \nincidence rates of 5.3, 5.1, and 3.1 events per 100 patient-years of exposure for canagliflozin 100 mg, \ncanagliflozin 300 mg, and placebo, respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nThe overall incidence rate of elevated serum potassium was higher in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment with incidence rates of 4.9, 6.1, and 5.4 events per 100 patient-years of exposure for \ncanagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, and placebo, respectively. In general, elevations were \ntransient and did not require specific treatment.\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment, increases in serum creatinine of 9.2 \u00b5mol/L and BUN of \napproximately 1.0 mmol/L were observed with both doses of canagliflozin.\n\nThe incidence rates for larger decreases in eGFR (> 30%) at any time during treatment were 7.3, 8.1, \nand 6.5 events per 100 patient-years of exposure for canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, and \nplacebo, respectively. At the last post-baseline value, incidence rates of such decreases were 3.3 for\npatients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg, 2.7 for canagliflozin 300 mg, and 3.7 events per \n100 patient-years of exposure for placebo (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients treated with canagliflozin regardless of baseline eGFR experienced an initial fall in mean \neGFR. Thereafter, eGFR was maintained or gradually increased during continued treatment. Mean \neGFR returned to baseline after treatment discontinuation suggesting that haemodynamic changes may \nplay a role in these renal function changes.\n\nRenal impairment in patients with diabetic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus\nIn a long-term renal outcomes study in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease, the \nincidence of renal-related events occurred frequently in both groups but less frequent in the \ncanagliflozin group (5.71 events per 100 patient-years) compared with the placebo group (7.91 events \nper 100 patient-years). Serious and severe renal-related events were also lower in the canagliflozin \ngroup versus placebo. The incidence rates of renal-related events were lower with canagliflozin \nrelative to placebo across all three eGFR strata; the highest incidence rate of renal-related events was \n\n\n\n15\n\nseen in the eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 stratum (9.47 vs 12.80 events per 100 patient-years for \ncanagliflozin versus placebo, respectively).\n\nIn the long-term renal outcomes study, no difference in serum potassium, no increase in adverse \nevents of hyperkalaemia, and no absolute (> 6.5 mEq/L) or relative (> upper limit of normal and \n> 15% increase from baseline) increases in serum potassium were observed with canagliflozin 100 mg \nrelative to placebo.\n\nIn general, there were no imbalances between treatment groups observed for abnormalities of \nphosphate, overall or in either eGFR category (45 to < 60 or 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n[CrCl 45 to < 60 or 30 to < 45 mL/min]).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSingle doses up to 1,600 mg of canagliflozin in healthy subjects and canagliflozin 300 mg twice daily \nfor 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes were generally well-tolerated.\n\nTherapy\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute clinical \nmeasures if required. Canagliflozin was negligibly removed during a 4-hour haemodialysis session. \nCanagliflozin is not expected to be dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excluding insulins.\nATC code: A10BK02.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe SGLT2 transporter, expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the \nreabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Patients with diabetes have been shown to \nhave elevated renal glucose reabsorption which may contribute to persistent elevated blood glucose \nconcentrations. Canagliflozin is an orally-active inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, \ncanagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), \nand thereby increases UGE, lowering elevated plasma glucose concentrations by this \ninsulin-independent mechanism in patients with type 2 diabetes. The increased UGE with SGLT2 \ninhibition also translates to an osmotic diuresis, with the diuretic effect leading to a reduction in \nsystolic blood pressure; the increase in UGE results in a loss of calories and therefore a reduction in \nbody weight, as has been demonstrated in studies of patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nCanagliflozin\u2019s action to increase UGE directly lowering plasma glucose is independent of insulin. \nImprovement in homeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA beta-cell) and improved \nbeta-cell insulin secretion response to a mixed-meal challenge has been observed in clinical studies \nwith canagliflozin.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\nIn phase 3 studies, pre-meal administration of canagliflozin 300 mg provided a greater reduction in \npostprandial glucose excursion than observed with the 100 mg dose. This effect at the 300 mg dose of \ncanagliflozin may, in part, be due to local inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 (an important intestinal \nglucose transporter) related to transient high concentrations of canagliflozin in the intestinal lumen \nprior to medicinal product absorption (canagliflozin is a low potency inhibitor of the SGLT1\ntransporter). Studies have shown no glucose malabsorption with canagliflozin.\n\nCanagliflozin increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule by blocking SGLT2-dependent \nglucose and sodium reabsorption thereby increasing tubuloglomerular feedback, which is associated \nwith a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and a decrease in hyperfiltration in preclinical models of \ndiabetes and clinical studies.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nFollowing single and multiple oral doses of canagliflozin to patients with type 2 diabetes, \ndose-dependent decreases in RTG and increases in UGE were observed. From a starting value of RTG\nof approximately 13 mmol/L, maximal suppression of 24-hour mean RTG was seen with the 300 mg \ndaily dose to approximately 4 mmol/L to 5 mmol/L in patients with type 2 diabetes in phase 1 studies, \nsuggesting a low risk for treatment-induced hypoglycaemia. The reductions in RTG led to increased \nUGE in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with either 100 mg or 300 mg of canagliflozin ranging \nfrom 77 g/day to 119 g/day across the phase 1 studies; the UGE observed translates to a loss of \n308 kcal/day to 476 kcal/day. The reductions in RTG and increases in UGE were sustained over a \n26-week dosing period in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moderate increases (generally < 400 mL to \n500 mL) in daily urine volume were seen that attenuated over several days of dosing. Urinary uric acid \nexcretion was transiently increased by canagliflozin (increased by 19% compared to baseline on day 1 \nand then attenuating to 6% on day 2 and 1% on day 13). This was accompanied by a sustained \nreduction in serum uric acid concentration of approximately 20%.\n\nIn a single-dose study in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with 300 mg before a mixed meal \ndelayed intestinal glucose absorption and reduced postprandial glucose through both a renal and a \nnon-renal mechanism.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nImprovement in glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality \nare integral parts of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nGlycaemic efficacy and safety\nA total of 10,501 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in ten double-blind, controlled clinical \nefficacy and safety studies conducted to evaluate the effects of Invokana on glycaemic control. The \nracial distribution was 72% White, 16% Asian, 5% Black, and 8% other groups. 17% of patients were \nHispanic. 58% of patients were male. Patients had an overall mean age of 59.5 years (range 21 years \nto 96 years), with 3,135 patients \u2265 65 years of age and 513 patients \u2265 75 years of age. 58% of patients \nhad a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m2. In the clinical development programme, 1,085 patients with \na baseline eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were evaluated.\n\nPlacebo-controlled studies\n\nCanagliflozin was studied as monotherapy, dual therapy with metformin, dual therapy with a \nsulphonylurea, triple therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea, triple therapy with metformin and \npioglitazone, and as an add-on therapy with insulin (table 4). In general, canagliflozin produced \nclinically and statistically significant (p < 0.001) results relative to placebo in glycaemic control, \nincluding HbA1c, the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 7%, change from baseline fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG). In addition, reductions in body weight \nand systolic blood pressure relative to placebo were observed.\n\n\n\n17\n\nFurthermore, canagliflozin was studied as triple therapy with metformin and sitagliptin and dosed with \na titration regimen, using a starting dose of 100 mg and titrated to 300 mg as early as week 6 in \npatients requiring additional glycaemic control who had appropriate eGFR and were tolerating \ncanagliflozin 100 mg (table 4). Canagliflozin dosed with a titration regimen produced clinically and \nstatistically significant (p < 0.001) results relative to placebo in glycaemic control, including HbA1c\nand change from baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and a statistically significant (p < 0.01) \nimprovement in the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 7%.

Canagliflozin 100 mg as \ndual therapy with metformin produced similar reductions in HbA1c from baseline and 300 mg \nproduced superior (p < 0.05) reductions in HbA1c compared to glimepiride, thus demonstrating \nnon-inferiority. A lower proportion of patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg (5.6%) and \ncanagliflozin 300 mg (4.9%) experienced at least one episode/event of hypoglycaemia over 52 weeks \nof treatment compared to the group treated with glimepiride (34.2%). In a study comparing \ncanagliflozin 300 mg to sitagliptin 100 mg in triple therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea, \ncanagliflozin demonstrated non-inferior (p < 0.05) and superior (p < 0.05) reduction in HbA1c relative \nto sitagliptin. The incidence of hypoglycaemia episodes/events with canagliflozin 300 mg and \nsitagliptin 100 mg was 40.7% and 43.2%, respectively. Significant improvements in body weight and \nreductions in systolic blood pressure compared to both glimepiride and sitagliptin were also observed.\n\nTable 5: Efficacy results from active-controlled clinical studiesa\n\nCompared to glimepiride as dual therapy with metformin (52 weeks)\nCanagliflozin + metformin Glimepiride \n\n(titrated) + \nmetformin\n(N = 482)\n\n100 mg\n(N = 483)\n\n300 mg\n(N = 485)\n\nHbA1c (%)\nBaseline (mean) 7.78 7.79 7.83\nChange from baseline (adjusted mean) -0.82 -0.93 -0.81\nDifference from glimepiride (adjusted\nmean) (95% CI)\n\n-0.01b\n\n(\u22120.11; 0.09)\n-0.12b\n\n(\u22120.22; \u22120.02)\nN/Ac\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c < 7% 53.6 60.1 55.8\nBody weight\n\nBaseline (mean) in kg 86.8 86.6 86.6\n% change from baseline (adjusted mean) -4.2 -4.7 1.0\nDifference from glimepiride (adjusted \nmean) (95% CI)\n\n-5.2b\n\n(\u22125.7; \u22124.7)\n-5.7b\n\n(\u22126.2; \u22125.1)\nN/Ac\n\nCompared to sitagliptin as triple therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea (52 weeks)\n\nCanagliflozin 300 mg + \nmetformin and sulphonylurea\n\n(N = 377)\n\nSitagliptin \n100 mg + \n\nmetformin and \nsulphonylurea\n\n(N = 378)\nHbA1c (%)\n\nBaseline (mean) 8.12 8.13\nChange from baseline (adjusted mean) -1.03 -0.66\nDifference from sitagliptin (adjusted \nmean) (95% CI)\n\n-0.37b\n\n(-0.50; -0.25)\nN/Ac\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c < 7% 47.6 35.3\nBody weight\n\nBaseline (mean) in kg 87.6 89.6\n% change from baseline (adjusted mean) -2.5 0.3\nDifference from sitagliptin (adjusted \nmean) (95% CI)\n\n-2.8d\n\n(-3.3; -2.2)\nN/Ac\n\n\n\n20\n\na Intent-to-treat population using last observation in study prior to glycaemic rescue therapy.\nb p < 0.05.\nc Not applicable.\nd p < 0.001.\n\nCanagliflozin as initial combination therapy with metformin\n\nCanagliflozin was evaluated in combination with metformin as initial combination therapy in patients \nwith type 2 diabetes failing diet and exercise.

Statistically significant \n(p < 0.001) changes from baseline HbA1c relative to placebo of -0.57% and -0.70% were observed for \n100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nPatients with eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\nIn a pooled analysis of patients (N = 721) with a baseline eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to \n< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, canagliflozin provided clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c compared to \nplacebo, with -0.47% for canagliflozin 100 mg and -0.52% for canagliflozin 300 mg. Patients with a \nbaseline eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated with canagliflozin 100 mg and \n300 mg exhibited mean improvements in percent change in body weight relative to placebo of -1.8% \nand -2.0%, respectively.\n\nThe majority of patients with a baseline eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were on \ninsulin and/or a sulphonylurea (85% [614/721]). Consistent with the expected increase of \nhypoglycaemia when a medicinal product not associated with hypoglycaemia is added to insulin \nand/or sulphonylurea, an increase in hypoglycaemia episodes/events was seen when canagliflozin was \nadded to insulin and/or a sulphonylurea (see section 4.8).\n\nFasting plasma glucose\n\nIn four placebo-controlled studies, treatment with canagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy \nwith one or two oral glucose-lowering medicinal products resulted in mean changes from baseline \nrelative to placebo in FPG of -1.2 mmol/L to -1.9 mmol/L for canagliflozin 100 mg and -1.9 mmol/L \nto -2.4 mmol/L for canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. These reductions were sustained over the \ntreatment period and near maximal after the first day of treatment.\n\nPostprandial glucose\n\nUsing a mixed-meal challenge, canagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy with one or two oral \nglucose-lowering medicinal products reduced postprandial glucose (PPG) from baseline relative to \nplacebo by -1.5 mmol/L to -2.7 mmol/L for canagliflozin 100 mg and -2.1 mmol/L to -3.5 mmol/L for \n300 mg, respectively, due to reductions in the pre-meal glucose concentration and reduced \npostprandial glucose excursions.\n\nBody weight\n\nCanagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg as monotherapy and as dual or triple add-on therapy resulted in \nstatistically significant reductions in the percentage of body weight at 26 weeks relative to placebo. In \ntwo 52-week active-controlled studies comparing canagliflozin to glimepiride and sitagliptin, \nsustained and statistically significant mean reductions in the percentage of body weight for \n\n\n\n22\n\ncanagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin were -4.2% and -4.7% for canagliflozin 100 mg and \n300 mg, respectively, compared to the combination of glimepiride and metformin (1.0%) and -2.5% \nfor canagliflozin 300 mg in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea compared to sitagliptin \nin combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea (0.3%).\n\nA subset of patients (N = 208) from the active-controlled dual therapy study with metformin who \nunderwent dual energy X-ray densitometry (DXA) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans \nfor evaluation of body composition demonstrated that approximately two-thirds of the weight loss \nwith canagliflozin was due to loss of fat mass with similar amounts of visceral and abdominal \nsubcutaneous fat being lost. Two hundred eleven (211) patients from the clinical study in older \npatients participated in a body composition substudy using DXA body composition analysis. This \ndemonstrated that approximately two-thirds of the weight loss associated with canagliflozin was due \nto loss of fat mass relative to placebo. There were no meaningful changes in bone density in trabecular \nand cortical regions.\n\nBlood pressure\n\nIn placebo-controlled studies, treatment with canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg resulted in mean \nreductions in systolic blood pressure of -3.9 mmHg and -5.3 mmHg, respectively, compared to \nplacebo (-0.1 mmHg) and a smaller effect on diastolic blood pressure with mean changes for \ncanagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg of -2.1 mmHg and -2.5 mmHg, respectively, compared to placebo \n(-0.3 mmHg). There was no notable change in heart rate.\n\nPatients with baseline HbA1c > 10% to \u2264 12%\n\nA substudy of patients with baseline HbA1c > 10% to \u2264 12% with canagliflozin as monotherapy \nresulted in reductions from baseline in HbA1c (not placebo-adjusted) of -2.13% and -2.56% for \ncanagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively.\n\nCardiovascular outcomes in the CANVAS Program\n\nThe effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes who had established \ncardiovascular (CV) disease or were at risk for CVD (two or more CV risk factors), was evaluated in \nthe CANVAS Program (integrated analysis of the CANVAS and the CANVAS-R study). These \nstudies were multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, with similar \ninclusion and exclusion criteria and patient populations. The CANVAS Program compared the risk of \nexperiencing a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) defined as the composite of\ncardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, between canagliflozin and \nplacebo on a background of standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular \ndisease.\n\nIn CANVAS, subjects were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, \nor matching placebo. In CANVAS-R, subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg or \nmatching placebo, and titration to 300 mg was permitted (based on tolerability and glycaemic needs) \nafter Week 13. Concomitant antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, according to \nthe standard care for these diseases.\n\nA total of 10,134 patients were treated (4,327 in CANVAS and 5,807 in CANVAS-R; total of 4,344 \nrandomly assigned to placebo and 5,790 to canagliflozin) for a mean exposure duration of 149 weeks \n(223 weeks in CANVAS and 94 weeks in CANVAS-R). Vital status was obtained for 99.6% of \nsubjects across the studies. The mean age was 63 years and 64% were male. Sixty-six percent of \nsubjects had a history of established cardiovascular disease, with 56% having a history of coronary \ndisease, 19% with cerebrovascular disease, and 21% with peripheral vascular disease; 14% had a \nhistory of heart failure.\n\nThe mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.2% and mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years.\n\n\n\n23\n\nBaseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 80% of patients and moderately impaired in \n20% of patients (mean eGFR 77 mL/min/1.73 m2). At baseline, patients were treated with one or more \nantidiabetic medicinal product including metformin (77%), insulin (50%), and sulfonylurea (43%).\n\nThe primary endpoint in the CANVAS Program was the time to first occurrence of a MACE. \nSecondary endpoints within a sequential conditional hypothesis testing were all-cause mortality and \ncardiovascular mortality.\n\nPatients in the pooled canagliflozin groups (pooled analysis of canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin \n300 mg, and canagliflozin up-titrated from 100 mg to 300 mg) had a lower rate of MACE as compared \nto placebo: 2.69 versus 3.15 patients per 100 patient-years (HR of the pooled analysis: 0.86; 95% CI \n(0.75, 0.97).\n\nBased on the Kaplan-Meier plot for the first occurrence of MACE, shown below, the reduction in \nMACE in the canagliflozin group was observed as early as Week 26 and was maintained throughout \nthe remainder of the study (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Time to first occurrence of MACE\n\nThere were 2,011 patients with eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The MACE findings in this \nsubgroup were consistent with the overall findings.\n\nEach MACE component positively contributed to the overall composite, as shown in Figure 2. Results \nfor the 100 mg and 300 mg canagliflozin doses were consistent with results for the combined dose \ngroups.\n\nFigure 2: Treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint and its components\n\n1 P value for superiority (2-sided) = 0.0158.\n\n\n\n24\n\nAll-cause mortality in the CANVAS Program\n\nIn the combined canagliflozin group, the HR for all-cause mortality versus placebo was 0.87; 95% CI \n(0.74, 1.01).\n\nHeart failure requiring hospitalization in the CANVAS Program\n\nCanagliflozin reduced the risk for heart failure requiring hospitalization compared to placebo (HR:\n0.67; 95% CI (0.52, 0.87)).\n\nRenal endpoints in the CANVAS Program\n\nFor time to first adjudicated nephropathy event (doubling of serum creatinine, need for \nrenal-replacement therapy, and renal death), the HR was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.84) for canagliflozin \n(0.15 events per 100 patient-years) versus placebo (0.28 events per 100 patient-years). In addition, \ncanagliflozin reduced progression of albuminuria 25.8% versus placebo 29.2% (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: \n0.67, 0.79) in patients with baseline normo- or micro-albuminuria.\n\nRenal outcomes in the CREDENCE study\n\nThe effect of canagliflozin 100 mg on renal events in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney \ndisease (DKD) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and \nalbuminuria (\u02c3 300 to 5000 mg/g of creatinine), was evaluated in the Canagliflozin and Renal Events \nin Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation Trial (CREDENCE). This was a \nmulti-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled, \nparallel-group study. The CREDENCE study compared the risk of experiencing DKD defined as the \ncomposite of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or cardiovascular \ndeath, between canagliflozin 100 mg and placebo on a background of standard of care treatments for \nDKD, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker \n(ARB). Canagliflozin 300 mg was not investigated in this study.\n\nIn CREDENCE, subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo, stratified by \nscreening eGFR 30 to <45, 45 to <60, 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Treatment with canagliflozin \n100 mg was continued in patients until the initiation of dialysis or in the event of renal transplantation.\n\nA total of 4,397 subjects were treated and exposed for a mean of 115 weeks. The mean age was \n63 years and 66% were male.\n\nThe mean baseline HbA1c was 8.3% and baseline median urine albumin/creatinine was 927 mg/g. The \nmost frequent antihyperglycaemic agents (AHA) used at baseline were insulin (65.5%), biguanides \n(57.8%), and sulfonylureas (28.8%). Nearly all subjects (99.9%) were on ACEi or ARB at \nrandomisation. About 92% of the subjects were on cardiovascular therapies (not including \nACEi/ARBs) at baseline, with approximately 60% taking an anti-thrombotic agent (including \nacetylsalicylic acid) and 69% on statins.\n\nThe mean baseline eGFR was 56.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 and approximately 60% of the population had a \nbaseline eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The proportion of subjects with prior CV disease was 50.4%; \n14.8% had a history of heart failure.\n\nThe primary composite endpoint in the CREDENCE study was the time to first occurrence of ESKD \n(defined as an eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis or renal transplant), doubling \nof serum creatinine, and renal or CV death.\n\nCanagliflozin 100 mg significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of the primary composite \nendpoint of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death [p<0.0001; HR: 0.70; 95% \n\n\n\n25\n\nCI: 0.57, 0.84] (see Figure 4). Treatment effect was consistent across subgroups, including all three \neGFR strata and subjects with or without a history of CV disease.\n\nBased on the Kaplan-Meier plot for the time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint \nshown below, the treatment effect was evident beginning from Week 52 with canagliflozin 100 mg \nand was maintained through the end of study (see Figure 3).\n\nCanagliflozin 100 mg significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular secondary endpoints, as shown \nin Figure 4.\n\nFigure 3: CREDENCE: Time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint\n\n* 95% RCI (Repeated Confidence Interval) for the primary endpoint with family-wise type I error-rate controlled at a \n2-sided significance level of 0.05.\n\n\n\n26\n\nFigure 4: Treatment effect for the primary composite endpoint and its components and secondary\nendpoints\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the eGFR in placebo-treated patients demonstrated a progressive linear decline \nover time; in contrast, the canagliflozin group showed an acute decrease at Week 3, followed by an\nattenuated decline over time; after Week 52, the LS mean decrease in eGFR was smaller in the \ncanagliflozin group than in the placebo group, and the treatment effect was maintained through the end \nof treatment.\n\nFigure 5: LS mean change from baseline in eGFR over time (on-treatment analysis set)\n\nIn CREDENCE, the incidence rate for renal-related adverse events was lower in the canagliflozin \n100 mg group compared with the placebo group (5.71 and 7.91 per 100 patient-years in canagliflozin \n100 mg and placebo, respectively).\n\n\n\n27\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ncanagliflozin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin are essentially similar in healthy subjects and patients with \ntype 2 diabetes. After single-dose oral administration of 100 mg and 300 mg in healthy subjects, \ncanagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 hour \nto 2 hours post-dose. Plasma Cmax and AUC of canagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner \nfrom 50 mg to 300 mg. The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) (expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation) \nwas 10.6 \u00b1 2.13 hours and 13.1 \u00b1 3.28 hours for the 100 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively. \nSteady-state was reached after 4 days to 5 days of once-daily dosing with canagliflozin 100 mg to \n300 mg. Canagliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics, and accumulated in plasma \nup to 36% following multiple doses of 100 mg and 300 mg.\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe mean absolute oral bioavailability of canagliflozin is approximately 65%. Co-administration of a \nhigh-fat meal with canagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin; therefore, \nInvokana may be taken with or without food. However, based on the potential to reduce postprandial \nplasma glucose excursions due to delayed intestinal glucose absorption, it is recommended that \nInvokana be taken before the first meal of the day (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nDistribution\n\nThe mean steady-state volume of distribution of canagliflozin following a single intravenous infusion \nin healthy subjects was 83.5 litres, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. Canagliflozin is \nextensively bound to proteins in plasma (99%), mainly to albumin. Protein binding is independent of \ncanagliflozin plasma concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients \nwith renal or hepatic impairment.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nO-glucuronidation is the major metabolic elimination pathway for canagliflozin, which is mainly \nglucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 to two inactive O-glucuronide metabolites. \nCYP3A4-mediated (oxidative) metabolism of canagliflozin is minimal (approximately 7%) in humans.\n\nIn in vitro studies, canagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, or CYP2E1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, nor induced CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, \nCYP3A4 at higher than therapeutic concentrations. No clinically relevant effect on CYP3A4 was \nobserved in vivo (see section 4.5).\n\nElimination\n\nFollowing administration of a single oral [14C]canagliflozin dose to healthy subjects, 41.5%, 7.0%, and \n3.2% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in faeces as canagliflozin, a hydroxylated \nmetabolite, and an O-glucuronide metabolite, respectively. Enterohepatic circulation of canagliflozin \nwas negligible.\n\nApproximately 33% of the administered radioactive dose was excreted in urine, mainly as \nO-glucuronide metabolites (30.5%). Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged \ncanagliflozin in urine. Renal clearance of canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg doses ranged from \n1.30 mL/min to 1.55 mL/min.\n\n\n\n28\n\nCanagliflozin is a low-clearance substance, with a mean systemic clearance of approximately \n192 mL/min in healthy subjects following intravenous administration.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nA single-dose, open-label study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin 200 mg in subjects \nwith varying degrees of renal impairment (classified using CrCl based on the Cockroft-Gault equation)\ncompared to healthy subjects. The study included 8 subjects with normal renal function \n(CrCl \u2265 80 mL/min), 8 subjects with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min),\n8 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 mL/min to < 50 mL/min), and 8 subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) as well as 8 subjects with ESKD on haemodialysis.\n\nThe Cmax of canagliflozin was moderately increased by 13%, 29%, and 29% in subjects with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal failure, respectively, but not in subjects on haemodialysis. Compared to \nhealthy subjects, plasma AUC of canagliflozin was increased by approximately 17%, 63%, and 50% \nin subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, but was similar for ESKD \nsubjects and healthy subjects.\n\nCanagliflozin was negligibly removed by haemodialysis.\n\nHepatic impairment\nRelative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUC\u221e of \ncanagliflozin were 107% and 110%, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class A (mild hepatic \nimpairment) and 96% and 111%, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class B (moderate) hepatic \nimpairment following administration of a single 300 mg dose of canagliflozin.\n\nThese differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in \npatients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)\nAge had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nA paediatric phase 1 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin in \nchildren and adolescents \u2265 10 to < 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The observed \npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those found in adult subjects.\n\nOther special populations\n\nPharmacogenetics\nBoth UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 are subject to genetic polymorphism. In a pooled analysis of clinical \ndata, increases in canagliflozin AUC of 26% were observed in UGT1A9*1/*3 carriers and 18% in \nUGT2B4*2/*2 carriers. These increases in canagliflozin exposure are not expected to be clinically \nrelevant. The effect of being homozygote (UGT1A9*3/*3, frequency < 0.1%) is probably more \nmarked, but has not been investigated.\n\nGender, race/ethnicity, or body mass index had no clinically meaningful effect on the \npharmacokinetics of canagliflozin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\n\n\n29\n\nCanagliflozin showed no effects on fertility and early embryonic development in the rat at exposures \nup to 19 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).\n\nIn an embryo-foetal development study in rats, ossification delays of metatarsal bones were observed \nat systemic exposures 73 times and 19 times higher than the clinical exposures at the 100 mg and \n300 mg doses. It is unknown whether ossification delays can be attributed to effects of canagliflozin \non calcium homeostasis observed in adult rats. Ossification delays were also observed for the \ncombination of canagliflozin and metformin, which were more prominent than for metformin alone at \ncanagliflozin exposures 43 times and 12 times higher than clinical exposures at 100 mg and 300 mg \ndoses.\n\nIn a pre- and postnatal development study, canagliflozin administered to female rats from gestation \nday 6 to lactation day 20 resulted in decreased body weights in male and female offspring at \nmaternally toxic doses > 30 mg/kg/day (exposures \u2265 5.9 times the human exposure to canagliflozin at \nthe MHRD). Maternal toxicity was limited to decreased body weight gain.\n\nA study in juvenile rats administered canagliflozin from day 1 through day 90 postnatal did not show \nincreased sensitivity compared to effects observed in adults rats. However, dilatation of the renal \npelvis was noticed with a No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) at exposures 2.4 times and 0.6 times the \nclinical exposures at 100 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively, and did not fully reverse within the \napproximately 1-month recovery period. Persistent renal findings in juvenile rats can most likely be \nattributed to reduced ability of the developing rat kidney to handle canagliflozin-increased urine \nvolumes, as functional maturation of the rat kidney continues through 6 weeks of age.\n\nCanagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in male and female mice in a 2-year study at \ndoses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg. The highest dose of 100 mg/kg provided up to 14 times the clinical \ndose of 300 mg based on AUC exposure. Canagliflozin increased the incidence of testicular Leydig \ncell tumours in male rats at all doses tested (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg); the lowest dose of 10 mg/kg is \napproximately 1.5 times the clinical dose of 300 mg based on AUC exposure. The higher doses of \ncanagliflozin (100 mg/kg) in male and female rats increased the incidence of pheochromocytomas and \nrenal tubular tumours. Based on AUC exposure, the NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day for pheochromocytomas \nand renal tubular tumours is approximately 4.5 times the exposure at the daily clinical dose of 300 mg. \nBased on preclinical and clinical mechanistic studies, Leydig cell tumours, renal tubule tumours, and \npheochromocytomas are considered to be rat-specific. Canagliflozin-induced renal tubule tumours and \npheochromocytomas in rats appear to be caused by carbohydrate malabsorption as a consequence of \nintestinal SGLT1 inhibitory activity of canagliflozin in the gut of rats; mechanistic clinical studies \nhave not demonstrated carbohydrate malabsorption in humans at canagliflozin doses of up to 2-times \nthe maximum recommended clinical dose. The Leydig cell tumours are associated with an increase in \nluteinizing hormone (LH), which is a known mechanism of Leydig cell tumour formation in rats. In a \n12-week clinical study, unstimulated LH did not increase in male patients treated with canagliflozin.\n\n6.

What you need to know before you take Invokana\n3. How to take Invokana\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Invokana\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Invokana is and what it is used for\n\nInvokana contains the active substance canagliflozin which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\u201cblood-glucose lowering drugs.\u201d\n\nInvokana is used:\n\uf0b7 to treat adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis medicine works by increasing the amount of sugar removed from your body in your urine. This \nreduces the amount of sugar in your blood and can help prevent heart disease in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM). It also helps to slow down deterioration of kidney function in patients with\nT2DM by a mechanism beyond blood glucose lowering.\n\nInvokana can be used by itself or along with other medicines you may be using to treat your type 2 \ndiabetes (such as metformin, insulin, a DPP-4 inhibitor [such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, or linagliptin], \na sulphonylurea [such as glimepiride or glipizide], or pioglitazone) that lower blood sugar levels. You \nmay already be taking one or more of these to treat your type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt is also important to keep following advice about diet and exercise given by your doctor or nurse.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical conditions \nsuch as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Invokana\n\nDo not take Invokana\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to canagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\n\n\n41\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Invokana, and during treatment:\n\uf0b7 about what you can do to prevent dehydration (see section 4 for signs of dehydration).\n\uf0b7 if you have type 1 diabetes because Invokana should not be used to treat this condition.\n\uf0b7 if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, \n\nfast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, \na sweet or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat, talk to a \ndoctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately. These symptoms could be a sign of \u201cdiabetic \nketoacidosis\u201d \u2013 a rare but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes \nbecause of increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of \ndeveloping diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol \nconsumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to \nmajor surgery or serious illness.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid \nweight loss, nausea, or vomiting). Invokana should not be used to treat this condition.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.\n\uf0b7 if you have severe liver problems.\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had serious heart disease or if you have had a stroke.\n\uf0b7 if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) or have ever had low \n\nblood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below in \u201cOther medicines and \nInvokana\u201d.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have had a lower limb amputation.\n\uf0b7 It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care \n\nand adequate hydration given by your healthcare professional. You should notify your doctor\nimmediately if you notice any wounds or discolouration, or if you experience any tenderness or \npain in your feet. Some studies indicate that taking canagliflozin may have contributed to the \nrisk of lower limb amputation (mainly toe and midfoot amputations).\n\n\uf0b7 Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or\nfeeling generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even \nlife-threatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u2019s gangrene \nwhich destroys the tissue under the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have signs of a genital yeast infection such as irritation, itching, unusual discharge or \nodour.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nKidney function\nYour kidneys will be tested by a blood test before you start taking and while you are on this medicine.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on \nthis medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nInvokana is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Invokana\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because this medicine can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some \nother medicines can affect the way this medicine works.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\n\n\n42\n\n\uf0b7 other antidiabetics - either insulin or a sulphonylurea (such as glimepiride or glipizide) \u2013 your \ndoctor may want to reduce your dose in order to avoid your blood sugar level from getting too \nlow (hypoglycaemia)\n\n\uf0b7 medicines used to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives), including diuretics\n(medicines used to remove levels of excess water in the body, also known as water tablets) since \nthis medicine can also lower your blood pressure by removing levels of excess water in the \nbody. Possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed in section 4.\n\n\uf0b7 St. John\u2019s wort (an herbal medicine to treat depression)\n\uf0b7 carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital (medicines used to control seizures)\n\uf0b7 efavirenz or ritonavir (a medicine used to treat HIV infection)\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)\n\uf0b7 cholestyramine (medicine used to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood). See section 3, \u201cTaking \n\nthis medicine\u201d.\n\uf0b7 digoxin or digitoxin (medicines used for certain heart problems). The level of digoxin or \n\ndigitoxin in your blood may need to be checked if taken with Invokana.\n\uf0b7 dabigatran (blood thinner medicine that lowers the risk of blood clot formation).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking or continuing to take this medicine. Invokana\nshould not be used during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to discontinue Invokana \nand control your blood sugar as soon as you know that you are pregnant.\n\nYou should not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. Talk to your doctor about whether to stop \ntaking this medicine or to stop breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nInvokana has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use tools or machines.\nHowever, dizziness or lightheadedness has been reported, which may affect your ability to drive, \ncycle, or use tools or machines.\n\nTaking Invokana with other medicines for diabetes called sulphonylureas (such as glimepiride or \nglipizide) or insulin can increase the risk of having low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what invokana is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "invokana contains the active substance canagliflozin which belongs to a group of medicines called \"blood-glucose lowering drugs.\" invokana is used: to treat adults with type 2 diabetes. this medicine works by increasing the amount of sugar removed from your body in your urine. this reduces the amount of sugar in your blood and can help prevent heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). it also helps to slow down deterioration of kidney function in patients with t2dm by a mechanism beyond blood glucose lowering. invokana can be used by itself or along with other medicines you may be using to treat your type 2 diabetes (such as metformin, insulin, a dpp-4 inhibitor [such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, or linagliptin], a sulphonylurea [such as glimepiride or glipizide], or pioglitazone) that lower blood sugar levels. you may already be taking one or more of these to treat your type 2 diabetes. it is also important to keep following advice about diet and exercise given by your doctor or nurse. what is type 2 diabetes? type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. your body can also make too much sugar. when this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. this can lead to serious medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "invokana", "Type":
