NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nEach tablet contains 2.5 mg of saxagliptin (as hydrochloride) and 850 mg of metformin hydrochloride.\n\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets\nEach tablet contains 2.5 mg of saxagliptin (as hydrochloride) and 1,000 mg of metformin \nhydrochloride.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nLight brown to brown, biconvex, round, film-coated tablets, with “2.5/850” printed on one side and \n“4246” printed on the other side, in blue ink.\n\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets\nPale yellow to light yellow, biconvex, oval shaped, film-coated tablets, with “2.5/1000” printed on one \nside and “4247” printed on the other side, in blue ink.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nKomboglyze is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \nimprove glycaemic control:\n\n in patients inadequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone\n\n in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, in \npatients inadequately controlled with metformin and these medicinal products (see sections 4.4, \n4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations)\n\n in patients already being treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin as separate \ntablets.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nAdults with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 mL/min)\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy\nPatients not adequately controlled on metformin alone should receive a dose of this medicinal product \nequivalent to the total daily dose of saxagliptin 5 mg, dosed as 2.5 mg twice daily, plus the dose of \nmetformin already being taken.\n\n\n\n3\n\nFor patients switching from separate tablets of saxagliptin and metformin\nPatients switching from separate tablets of saxagliptin and metformin should receive the doses of \nsaxagliptin and metformin already being taken.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy of insulin and metformin, or for \npatients controlled on triple combination therapy of insulin, and metformin plus saxagliptin as \nseparate tablets\nThe dose of this medicinal product should provide saxagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily \ndose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When this medicinal product is \nused in combination with insulin, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy of a sulphonylurea and metformin, \nor for patients switching from triple combination therapy of saxagliptin, metformin and a \nsulphonylurea taken as separate tablets\nThe dose of this medicinal product should provide saxagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily \ndose), and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When this medicinal product is \nused in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be required to \nreduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy of dapagliflozin and metformin, or \nfor patients switching from triple combination therapy of saxagliptin, metformin and dapagliflozin \ntaken as separate tablets\nThe dose of this medicinal product should provide saxagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily \ndose), and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (GFR 60-89 mL/min).\n\nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing products and at \nleast annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in \nthe elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months. The maximum \ndaily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that may increase \nthe risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering initiation of \nKomboglyze in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min.\n\nIf no adequate strength of Komboglyze is available, individual monocomponents should be used \ninstead of the fixed dose combination.\n\nTable 1 Dosage in patients with renal impairment\n\nGFR mL/min Metformin Saxagliptin\n\n60-89\nMaximum daily dose is 3000 mg.\n\nDose reduction may be considered in \nrelation to declining renal function.\n\nMaximum total daily dose is 5 mg.\n\n45-59\nMaximum daily dose is 2000 mg.\n\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nMaximum total daily dose is 5 mg.\n\n30-44\nMaximum daily dose is 1000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nMaximum total daily dose is 2.5 mg.\n\n< 30 Metformin is contraindicated.\n\nMaximum total daily dose is 2.5 mg.\n\n\n\n4\n\nHepatic impairment\nThis medicinal product must not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and \n4.5). \n\nElderly (≥ 65 years)\nAs metformin and saxagliptin are excreted by the kidney, this medicinal product should be used with \ncaution in the elderly. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent metformin-associated lactic \nacidosis, particularly in the elderly (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of this medicinal product in children and adolescents from birth to < 18 years \nof age have not been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nKomboglyze should be given twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions \nassociated with metformin.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nhistory of a serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic \nshock, and angioedema, to any dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8); \n\n- Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis);\n- Diabetic pre-coma;\n- Severe renal failure (GFR < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2);\n- Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as:\n\n- dehydration,\n- severe infection,\n- shock;\n\n- Acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as:\n- cardiac or respiratory failure,\n- recent myocardial infarction,\n- shock;\n\n- Hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.5);\n- Acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.5);\n- Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nKomboglyze should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of \ndiabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis; persistent, severe abdominal \npain. If pancreatitis is suspected, this medicinal product should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is \nconfirmed, this medicinal product should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with \na history of pancreatitis.\n\nIn postmarketing experience of saxagliptin, there have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions \nof acute pancreatitis. \n\n\n\n5\n\nLactic acidosis\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.\n\nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, heat, reduced fluid intake), Komboglyze \nshould be temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.\n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nNSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic \nacidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, \nprolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts that may cause lactic acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed on the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia \nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking Komboglyze and \nseek immediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/L, and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. \n\nRenal function\nAs metformin is excreted by the kidney, renal function should be assessed:\n- Before initiation of treatment and regularly thereafter (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n- For renal function with GFR levels approaching moderate renal impairment and in elderly \n\npatients, at least 2 to 4 times per year.\n- In patients with moderate renal impairment that have GFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min, in the absence \n\nof other conditions that may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, the dose is 2.5 mg/1000 mg or \n2.5 mg/850 mg once daily. It is not recommended to initiate treatment in these patients. \nTreatment may be continued in the well-informed patients with close monitoring.\n\n- Metformin is contraindicated in patients with a GFR < 30 mL/min and should be temporarily \ndiscontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3).\n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with a NSAID.\n\nSurgery\nKomboglyze must be discontinued at the time of surgery with general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. \nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition \nprovided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\n\nAdministration of iodinated contrast agents \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Komboglyze should be\ndiscontinued prior to, or at the time of, the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and \n4.5).\n\nSkin disorders\nUlcerative and necrotic skin lesions have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-clinical \ntoxicology studies for saxagliptin (see section 5.3). Skin lesions were not observed at an increased \nincidence in clinical trials. Postmarketing reports of rash have been described in the DPP4 inhibitor \nclass. Rash is also noted as an adverse event (AE) for saxagliptin (see section 4.8). Therefore, in \nkeeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, such as blistering, \nulceration or rash, is recommended.\n\n\n\n6\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nPostmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP4 \ninhibitor use, including saxagliptin. In reported cases, patients typically responded to topical or \nsystemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP4 inhibitor. If a patient \ndevelops blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin and bullous pemphigoid is suspected, this \nmedicinal product should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for \ndiagnosis and appropriate treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nAs this medicinal product contains saxagliptin, it should not be used in patients who have had any \nserious hypersensitivity reaction to a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor.\n\nDuring postmarketing experience, including spontaneous reports and clinical trials, the following \nadverse reactions have been reported with the use of saxagliptin: serious hypersensitivity reactions, \nincluding anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and angioedema. If a serious hypersensitivity \nreaction to saxagliptin is suspected, discontinue this medicinal product, assess for other potential \ncauses for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).\n\nChange in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes\nAs this medicinal product contains metformin, a patient with type 2 diabetes previously well \ncontrolled on Komboglyze who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague \nand poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic \nacidosis. Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, \nblood pH, lactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, this medicinal \nproduct must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.\n\nCardiac failure\nIn the SAVOR trial a small increase in the rate for hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the \nsaxagliptin treated patients compared to placebo, although a causal relationship has not been \nestablished (see section 5.1). Caution is warranted if this medicinal product is used in patients who \nhave known risk factors for hospitalisation for heart failure, such as a history of heart failure or \nmoderate to severe renal impairment. Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of \nheart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms.\n\nArthralgia\nJoint pain, which may be severe, has been reported in postmarketing reports for DPP4 inhibitors (see \nsection 4.8). Patients experienced relief of symptoms after discontinuation of the medicinal product \nand some experienced recurrence of symptoms with reintroduction of the same or another DPP4 \ninhibitor. Onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy may be rapid or may occur after \nlonger periods of treatment. If a patient presents with severe joint pain, continuation of drug therapy \nshould be individually assessed.\n\nImmunocompromised patients\nImmunocompromised patients, such as patients who have undergone organ transplantation or patients \ndiagnosed with human immunodeficiency syndrome, have not been studied in the saxagliptin clinical \nprogram. Therefore, the efficacy and safety profile of saxagliptin in these patients has not been \nestablished. \n\nUse with potent CYP3A4 inducers\nUsing CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and \nrifampicin may reduce the glycaemic lowering effect of saxagliptin (see section 4.5). \n\nUse with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia\nInsulin and sulphonylureas are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or \nsulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with \nKomboglyze.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCo-administration of multiple doses of saxagliptin (2.5 mg twice daily) and metformin (1,000 mg \ntwice daily) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either saxagliptin or metformin in \npatients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThere have been no formal interaction studies for Komboglyze. The following statements reflect the \ninformation available on the individual active substances.\n\nSaxagliptin\nClinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions with \nco-administered medicinal products is low. \n\nThe metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). In in \nvitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, \n2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. In studies conducted in healthy \nsubjects, neither the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin nor its major metabolite, were meaningfully \naltered by metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, omeprazole, antacids or \nfamotidine. In addition, saxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, \nglibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, the active components of a combined oral \ncontraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate), diltiazem or ketoconazole.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 diltiazem, \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 63% and 2.1-fold, respectively, and the corresponding \nvalues for the active metabolite were decreased by 44% and 34%, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5-fold, respectively, and the corresponding \nvalues for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax\nand AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the \nplasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nThe co-administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin (such as \ncarbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital and phenytoin) have not been studied and may result in \ndecreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. \nGlycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent \nCYP3A4 inducer.\n\nThe effects of smoking, diet, herbal products, and alcohol use on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin \nhave not been specifically studied.\n\nMetformin\nConcomitant use not recommended\nCationic substances that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may interact with \nmetformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted in seven \nnormal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased \nmetformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring of \nglycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered.\n\n\n\n8\n\nAlcohol\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment due to the metformin active substance of Komboglyze (see \nsection 4.4). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.\n\nIodinated contrast agents\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Komboglyze must be \ndiscontinued prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4).\n\nCombination requiring precautions for use\nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta-2 agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperfomed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the \ndose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and on its discontinuation.\n\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \nproducts in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThe use of Komboglyze or saxagliptin has not been studied in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity at high doses of saxagliptin alone or in combination with metformin \n(see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. A limited amount of data suggest the use \nof metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. \nAnimal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic \nor foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). This medicinal product\nshould not be used during pregnancy. If the patient wishes to become pregnant, or if a pregnancy \noccurs, treatment with this medicinal product should be discontinued and switched to insulin treatment \nas soon as possible.\n\nBreast-feeding\nStudies in animals have shown excretion of both saxagliptin and/or metabolite and metformin in milk. \nIt is unknown whether saxagliptin is excreted in human milk, but metformin is excreted in human milk \nin small amounts. This medicinal product must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding \n(see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\nThe effect of saxagliptin on fertility in humans has not been studied. Effects on fertility were observed \nin male and female rats at high doses producing overt signs of toxicity (see section 5.3). For \nmetformin, studies in animals have not shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSaxagliptin or metformin has a negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When \ndriving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness has been reported in studies \nwith saxagliptin. In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nKomboglyze is used in combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause \nhypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin, sulphonylureas).\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nThere have been no therapeutic clinical trials conducted with Komboglyze tablets, however,\nbioequivalence of Komboglyze with co-administered saxagliptin and metformin has been \ndemonstrated (see section 5.2).\n\nSaxagliptin\nSummary of the safety profile\nThere were 4,148 patients with type 2 diabetes, including 3,021 patients treated with saxagliptin, \nrandomised in six double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate \nthe effects of saxagliptin on glycaemic control. In randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials \n(including developmental and postmarketing experience), over 17,000 patients with type 2 diabetes \nhave been treated with saxagliptin.\n\nIn a pooled analysis of 1,681 patients with type 2 diabetes, including 882 patients treated with \nsaxagliptin 5 mg, randomised in five double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy \nstudies conducted to evaluate the effects of saxagliptin on glycaemic control, the overall incidence of \nAEs in patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg was similar to placebo. Discontinuation of therapy due to \nAEs was higher in patients who received saxagliptin 5 mg as compared to placebo (3.3% as compared \nto 1.8%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions reported in ≥ 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg and more commonly than \nin patients treated with placebo or that were reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg \nand ≥ 1% more frequently compared to placebo are shown in Table 2.\n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined \nas very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to 1/100), rare \n( 1/10,000 to 1/1,000), or very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).\n\nTable 2 Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class\n\nSystem organ class\nAdverse reaction\n\nFrequency of adverse reactions by treatment regimen\n\nSaxagliptin with metformin1\n\nInfections and infestations\nUpper respiratory infection Common\nUrinary tract infection Common\nGastroenteritis Common\nSinusitis Common\nNasopharyngitis Common2\n\nNervous system disorders\nHeadache Common\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVomiting Common\n1Includes saxagliptin in add-on to metformin and initial combination with metformin.\n2Only in the initial combination therapy.\n\nPostmarketing experience from clinical trials and spontaneous reports\nTable 3 shows additional adverse reactions which have been reported in postmarketing experience \nwith saxagliptin. The frequencies are based on the experience from clinical trials.\n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 3 Frequency of additional adverse reactions by system organ class\n\nSystem organ class\nAdverse Reaction Frequency of adverse reactions1\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nNausea Common\nPancreatitis Uncommon\nConstipation Not known\nImmune system disorders\nHypersensitivity reactions2 (see\nsections 4.3 and 4.4)\n\nUncommon\n\nAnaphylactic reactions including anaphylactic \nshock (see sections 4.3 and 4.4)\n\nRare\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nAngioedema (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) Rare\nDermatitis Uncommon\nPruritus Uncommon\nRash2 Common\nUrticaria Uncommon\nBullous pemphigoid Not known\n1 Frequency estimates are based on the pooled analysis of the saxagliptin monotherapy, add-on to metformin and initial \ncombination with metformin, add-on to sulphonylurea and add-on to thiazolidinedione clinical trials.\n2 These reactions were also identified in the pre-approval clinical trials, but do not meet the criteria for Table 2.\n\nSAVOR trial results\nThe SAVOR trial included 8240 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg or 2.5 mg once daily and 8173 \npatients on placebo. The overall incidence of AEs in patients treated with saxagliptin in this trial was \nsimilar to placebo (72.5% versus 72.2%, respectively).\n\nThe incidence of adjudicated pancreatitis events was 0.3% in both saxagliptin-treated patients and\nplacebo-treated patients in the intent-to-treat population.\n\nThe incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was 1.1% in both saxagliptin-treated patients and placebo-\ntreated patients.\n\nThe overall incidence of reported hypoglycaemia (recorded in daily patient diaries) was 17.1% in \nsubjects treated with saxagliptin and 14.8% among patients treated with placebo. The percent of \nsubjects with reported on-treatment events of major hypoglycaemia (defined as an event that required \nassistance of another person) was higher in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (2.1% and \n1.6%, respectively). The increased risk of overall hypoglycaemia and major hypoglycaemia observed \nin the saxagliptin-treated group occurred primarily in subjects treated with SU at baseline and not in \nsubjects on insulin or metformin monotherapy at baseline. The increased risk of overall and major \nhypoglycaemia was primarily observed in subjects with A1C < 7% at baseline.\n\nDecreased lymphocyte counts were reported in 0.5% of saxagliptin-treated patients and 0.4% of \nplacebo-treated patients.\n\nHospitalisation for heart failure, occurred at a greater rate in the saxagliptin group (3.5%) compared \nwith the placebo group (2.8%), with nominal statistical significance favouring placebo [HR = 1.27; \n95% CI 1.07, 1.51); P = 0.007]. See also section 5.1.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAEs, considered by the investigator to be at least possibly drug-related and reported in at least two \nmore patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg compared to control, are described below by treatment \nregimen.\n\n\n\n11\n\nAs monotherapy: dizziness (common) and fatigue (common).\n\nAs add-on to metformin: dyspepsia (common) and myalgia (common).\n\nAs initial combination with metformin: gastritis (common), arthralgia* (uncommon), myalgia \n(uncommon), and erectile dysfunction (uncommon).\n\nAs add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea: dizziness (common), fatigue (common) and flatulence \n(common).\n\n*Arthralgia has also been reported during postmarketing surveillance (see section 4.4).\n\nHypoglycaemia\nAdverse reactions of hypoglycaemia were based on all reports of hypoglycaemia; a concurrent glucose \nmeasurement was not required. The incidence of reported hypoglycaemia for saxagliptin 5 mg versus \nplacebo given as add-on therapy to metformin was 5.8% versus 5%. The incidence of reported \nhypoglycaemia was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin and 4.0% \nin patients given metformin alone. When used as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin), the \noverall incidence of reported hypoglycaemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo.\n\nWhen used as add-on to metformin plus a sulphonylurea, the overall incidence of reported \nhypoglycaemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo.\n\nInvestigations\nAcross clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory AEs was similar in patients treated with saxagliptin \n5 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small decrease in absolute lymphocyte count was \nobserved. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2,200 cells/μL, a mean \ndecrease of approximately 100 cells/μL relative to placebo was observed in the placebo-controlled\npooled analysis. Mean absolute lymphocyte counts remained stable with daily dosing up to 102 weeks \nin duration. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse \nreactions. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not \nknown.\n\nMetformin\nClinical trial data and postmarketing data\nTable 4 presents adverse reactions by system organ class and by frequency category. Frequency \ncategories are based on information available from metformin Summary of Product Characteristics \navailable in the European Union.\n\nTable 4 The frequency of metformin adverse reactions identified from clinical trial and \npostmarketing data\n\nSystem organ class\nAdverse reaction\n\nFrequency \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nLactic acidosis Very rare\nVitamin B12 deficiency1 Very rare\nNervous system disorders \nMetallic taste Common\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal symptoms2 Very common\nHepatobiliary disorders\nLiver function disorders, hepatitis Very rare\n\n\n\n12\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUrticaria, erythema, pruritus Very rare\n1 Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely \nresult in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. megaloblastic anaemia).\n2 Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite occur most frequently \nduring initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in most cases.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo data are available with regard to overdose of Komboglyze.\n\nSaxagliptin\nSaxagliptin has been shown to be well-tolerated with no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval \nor heart rate at oral doses up to 400 mg daily for 2 weeks (80 times the recommended dose). In the \nevent of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient’s \nclinical status. Saxagliptin and its major metabolite can be removed by haemodialysis (23% of dose \nover 4 hours).\n\nMetformin\nHigh overdose or concomitant risks of metformin may lead to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a \nmedical emergency and must be treated in hospital. The most effective method to remove lactate and \nmetformin is haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD10.\n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects\nKomboglyze combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with complementary mechanisms \nof action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl \npeptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.\n\nSaxagliptin\nSaxagliptin is a highly potent (Ki: 1.3 nM), selective, reversible, competitive, DPP4 inhibitor. In \npatients with type 2 diabetes, administration of saxagliptin led to inhibition of DPP4 enzyme activity \nfor a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load, this DPP4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase \nin circulating levels of active incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and \nglucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), decreased glucagon concentrations and increased \nglucose-dependent beta-cell responsiveness, which resulted in higher insulin and C-peptide \nconcentrations. The rise in insulin from pancreatic beta-cells and the decrease in glucagon from \npancreatic alpha-cells were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose \nexcursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Saxagliptin improves glycaemic control by \nreducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. \n\nMetformin\nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\nMetformin may act via three mechanisms:\n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in \n\nmuscle;\n- by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation;\n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption.\n\nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin \nincreases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and \nGLUT-4).\n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride levels.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials (including developmental and postmarketing \nexperience), over 17,000 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with saxagliptin.\n\nSaxagliptin in combination with metformin for glycaemic control\nThe co-administration of saxagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes \ninadequately controlled on metformin alone and in treatment-naive patients inadequately controlled on \ndiet and exercise alone. Treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg once daily produced clinically relevant and \nstatistically significant improvements in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) \nand postprandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo in combination with metformin (initial or add-on \ntherapy). Reductions in A1c were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline \nBMI. Decrease in body weight in the treatment groups given saxagliptin in combination with \nmetformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone. Saxagliptin plus metformin was \nnot associated with significant changes from baseline in fasting serum lipids compared to metformin \nalone.\n\nSaxagliptin add-on to metformin therapy\nAn add-on to metformin placebo-controlled study of 24-week duration was conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin in patients with inadequate \nglycaemic control (HbA1c 7-10%) on metformin alone. Saxagliptin (n=186) provided significant \nimprovements in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo (n=175). Improvements in HbA1c, \nPPG, and FPG following treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin were sustained up to \nWeek 102. The HbA1c change for saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin (n=31) compared to placebo plus \nmetformin (n=15) was -0.8% at Week 102.\n\nSaxagliptin twice daily add-on to metformin therapy\nAn add-on to metformin placebo-controlled study of 12-week duration was conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of saxagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with metformin in patients with \ninadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c 7-10%) on metformin alone. After 12 weeks, the saxagliptin \ngroup (n=74) had a greater HbA1c mean reduction from baseline than the placebo group (n=86) \n(-0.6% vs. -0.2%, respectively, difference of -0.34%, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.9% for the \nsaxagliptin group and 8.0% for the placebo group), and a greater FPG reduction (-13.73 mg/dL versus \n-4.22 mg/dL) but without statistical significance (p=0.12, 95% CI [-21.68; 2.66]).\n\nSaxagliptin add-on to metformin compared with sulphonylurea add-on to metformin\nA 52-week study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin 5 mg in combination \nwith metformin (428 patients) compared with sulphonylurea (glipizide, 5 mg titrated as needed to \n20 mg, mean dose of 15 mg) in combination with metformin (430 patients) in 858 patients with \ninadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c 6.5-10%) on metformin alone. The mean metformin dose was \napproximately 1900 mg in each treatment group. After 52 weeks, the saxagliptin and glipizide groups \nhad similar mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c in the per-protocol analysis (-0.7% vs. -0.8%, \nrespectively, mean baseline HbA1c of 7.5% for both groups). The intent-to-treat analysis showed \nconsistent results. The reduction in FPG was slightly less in the saxagliptin group and there were more \n\n\n\n14\n\ndiscontinuations (3.5% vs. 1.2%) due to lack of efficacy based on FPG criteria during the first \n24 weeks of the study. Saxagliptin also resulted in a significantly lower proportion of patients with \nhypoglycaemia, 3% (19 events in 13 subjects) vs. 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) for glipizide. \nPatients treated with saxagliptin exhibited a significant decrease from baseline in body weight \ncompared to a weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.1 vs. +1.1 kg).\n\nSaxagliptin add-on to metformin compared with sitagliptin add-on to metformin\nAn 18-week study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin 5 mg in \ncombination with metformin (403 patients), compared with sitagliptin 100 mg in combination with \nmetformin (398 patients) in 801 patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone. After \n18 weeks, saxagliptin was non-inferior to sitagliptin in mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c in both \nthe per-protocol and the full analysis sets. The reductions from baseline in HbA1c respectively for \nsaxagliptin and sitagliptin in the primary per-protocol analysis were -0.5% (mean and median) and \n-0.6% (mean and median). In the confirmatory full analysis set, mean reductions were -0.4% and \n-0.6% respectively for saxagliptin and sitagliptin, with median reductions of -0.5% for both groups.\n\nSaxagliptin in combination with metformin as initial therapy\nA 24-week study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin 5 mg in combination \nwith metformin as initial combination therapy in treatment-naive patients with inadequate glycaemic \ncontrol (HbA1c 8-12%). Initial therapy with the combination of saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin \n(n=306) provided significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG compared to with either \nsaxagliptin (n=317) or metformin (n=313) alone as initial therapy. Reductions in HbA1c from baseline \nto Week 24 were observed in all evaluated subgroups defined by baseline HbA1c, with greater \nreductions observed in patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 10% (see Table 5). Improvements in HbA1c, \nPPG, and FPG following initial therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin were sustained up to \nWeek 76. The HbA1c change for saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin (n=177) compared to metformin \nplus placebo (n=147) was -0.5% at Week 76.\n\nSaxagliptin add-on combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin)\nA total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with a stable \ndose of insulin (baseline mean: 54.2 Units) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control \n(HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11%) on insulin alone (n=141) or on insulin in combination with a stable dose \nof metformin (n=314). Saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin with or without metformin provided \nsignificant improvements after 24 weeks in HbA1c and PPG compared with placebo add-on to insulin \nwith or without metformin. Similar HbA1c reductions versus placebo were achieved for patients \nreceiving saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin regardless of metformin use (-0.4% for both subgroups). \nImprovements from baseline HbA1c were sustained in the saxagliptin add-on to insulin group \ncompared to the placebo add-on to insulin group with or without metformin at Week 52. The HbA1c \nchange for the saxagliptin group (n=244) compared to placebo (n=124) was -0.4% at Week 52.\n\nSaxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea\nA total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) in \ncombination with metformin plus sulphonylurea (SU) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control \n(HbA1c ≥ 7% and ≤ 10%). Saxagliptin (n=127) provided significant improvements in HbA1c and \nPPG compared with the placebo (n=128). The HbA1c change for saxagliptin compared to placebo was \n-0.7% at Week 24.\n\nSaxagliptin add-on to dapagliflozin plus metformin therapy\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus compared saxagliptin 5 mg with placebo as add-on therapy in individuals with \nHbA1c 7-10.5% treated with dapagliflozin (SGLT2-inhibtor) and metformin. Patients who completed \nthe initial 24-week study period were eligible to enter a controlled 28-week long-term study extension \n(52 weeks). \n\n\n\n15\n\nIndividuals treated with saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin and metformin (n=153) achieved \nstatistically significantly (p-value < 0.0001) greater reductions in HbA1c versus the group with \nplacebo added to dapagliflozin plus metformin (n=162) at 24 weeks (see Table 5). The effect on \nHbA1c observed at Week 24 was sustained at Week 52. The safety profile of saxagliptin added to \ndapagliflozin plus metformin in the long-term treatment period was consistent with that observed in \nthe 24-week treatment period in this study and in the trial in which saxagliptin and dapagliflozin were \ngiven concomitantly as add-on therapy to patients treated with metformin (described below).\n\nProportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7%\nThe proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% at Week 24 was higher in the saxagliptin 5 mg plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group 35.3% (95% CI [28.2, 42.4]) compared to the placebo plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group 23.1% (95% CI [16.9, 29.3]). The effect in HbA1c observed at \nWeek 24 was sustained at Week 52.\n\nTable 5 Key efficacy results in placebo-controlled, combination therapy studies of \nsaxagliptin and metformin\n\nMean \nbaseline \nHbA1c \n\n(%)\n\nMean change1\n\nfrom baseline \nHbA1c (%)\n\nPlacebo-corrected \nmean change in \n\nHbA1c (%) (95% \nCI)\n\nAdd-on/initial combination with metformin studies\n24-weeks \n\nSaxa 5 mg daily add-on to metformin; \nStudy CV181014 (n=186) 8.1 -0.7 -0.8 (-1.0, -0.6)2\n\nSaxa 5 mg daily initial combination \nwith metformin; Study CV1810393:\n\nOverall population (n=306)\nBaseline HbA1c ≥ 10% stratum \n(n=107)\n\n9.4\n10.8\n\n-2.5\n-3.3\n\n-0.5 (-0.7, -0.4)4\n\n-0.6 (-0.9, -0.3)5\n\n12-weeks\nSaxa 2.5 mg twice daily add-on to \nmetformin; Study CV181080 (n=74) 7.9 -0.6 -0.3 (-0.6,-0.1)6\n\nAdd-on/combination studies with additional therapies\nAdd-on to insulin (+/- metformin)\n\nSaxa 5 mg daily, Study CV181057: \nOverall population (n=300) 8.7 -0.7 -0.4 (-0.6, -0.2)2\n\n24-weeks\nSaxa 5 mg daily add-on to metformin \nplus sulphonylurea;\nStudy D1680L00006 (n=257) 8.4 -0.7 -0.7 (-0.9, -0.5)2\n\nSaxa 5 mg daily add-on to metformin \nplus dapagliflozin\nStudy CV181168 (n=315) 7.9 -0.5 -0.4 (-0.5, -0.2)7\n\nn=Randomised patients\n1 Adjusted mean change from baseline adjusted for baseline value (ANCOVA).\n2 p< 0.0001 compared to placebo.\n3 Metformin was uptitrated from 500 to 2000 mg per day as tolerated.\n4 Mean HbA1c change is the difference between the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin and metformin alone groups (p< 0.0001).\n5 Mean HbA1c change is the difference between the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin and metformin alone groups.\n6 p-value = 0.0063 (between group comparisons significant at α = 0.05).\n7 Mean HbA1c change is the difference between the saxagliptin 5 mg + dapagliflozin + metformin and dapagliflozin + \n\nmetformin groups (p< 0.0001).\n\nSaxagliptin and dapagliflozin add-on to metformin therapy\nA total of 534 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control on \nmetformin alone (HbA1c 8%-12%), participated in this 24-week randomised, double-blind, active \ncomparator-controlled trial to compare the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin added \n\n\n\n16\n\nconcurrently to metformin, versus saxagliptin or dapagliflozin added to metformin.

The \nstudy population included those ≥ 65 years (n=8561) and ≥ 75 years (n=2330), with normal or mild \nrenal impairment (n=13916) as well as moderate (n=2240) or severe (n=336) renal impairment.\n\nThe primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint was a composite endpoint \nconsisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major adverse CV events (MACE): \nCV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal ischaemic stroke.\n\nAfter a mean follow up of 2 years, the trial met its primary safety endpoint demonstrating saxagliptin \ndoes not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to placebo when \nadded to current background therapy.\n\n\n\n17\n\nNo benefit was observed for MACE or all-cause mortality.\n\nTable 7 Primary and secondary clinical endpoints by treatment group in the SAVOR study*\n\nEndpoint\n\nSaxagliptin\n(N=8280)\n\nPlacebo\n(N=8212)\n\nHazard \nRatio \n\n(95% CI)†\n\nSubjects with \nevents\nn (%)\n\nEvent rate \nper 100 \n\npatient-years\n\nSubjects \nwith events\n\nn (%)\n\nEvent rate per \n100 \n\npatient-years\n\nPrimary composite \nendpoint: MACE\n\n613\n(7.4)\n\n3.76 609\n(7.4)\n\n3.77 1.00\n(0.89, 1.12)‡,§, #\n\nSecondary composite \nendpoint: MACE plus\n\n1059\n(12.8)\n\n6.72 1034\n(12.6)\n\n6.60 1.02\n(0.94, 1.11)¶\n\nAll-cause mortality 420\n(5.1)\n\n2.50 378\n(4.6)\n\n2.26 1.11\n(0.96, 1.27)¶\n\n* Intent-to-treat population\n† Hazard ratio adjusted for baseline renal function category and baseline CVD risk category.\n‡ p-value < 0.001 for noninferiority (based on HR < 1.3) compared to placebo.\n§ p-value = 0.99 for superiority (based on HR < 1.0) compared to placebo.\n# Events accumulated consistently over time, and the event rates for saxagliptin and placebo did not diverge notably over \n\ntime.\n¶ Significance not tested.\n\nOne component of the secondary composite endpoint, hospitalisation for heart failure, occurred at a \ngreater rate in the saxagliptin group (3.5%) compared with the placebo group (2.8%), with nominal \nstatistical significance favouring placebo [HR=1.27; (95% CI 1.07, 1.51); P=0.007]. Clinically \nrelevant factors predictive of increased relative risk with saxagliptin treatment could not be \ndefinitively identified. Subjects at higher risk for hospitalisation for heart failure, irrespective of \ntreatment assignment, could be identified by known risk factors for heart failure such as baseline \nhistory of heart failure or impaired renal function. However, subjects on saxagliptin with a history of \nheart failure or impaired renal function at baseline were not at an increased risk relative to placebo for \nthe primary or secondary composite endpoints or all-cause mortality.\n\nAnother secondary endpoint, all-cause mortality, occurred at a rate of 5.1% in the saxagliptin group \nand 4.6% in the placebo group (see Table 7). CV deaths were balanced across the treatment groups. \nThere was a numerical imbalance in non-CV death, with more events on saxagliptin (1.8%) than \nplacebo (1.4%) [HR = 1.27; (95% CI 1.00, 1.62); P = 0.051].\n\nA1c was lower with saxagliptin compared to placebo in an exploratory analysis.\n\nMetformin\nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed:\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034;\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017;\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin \n13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and \nversus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n18.9 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.021);\n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin \n11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).\n\n\n\n18\n\nElderly population\nIn the SAVOR study subgroups over 65 and over 75 years of age, efficacy and safety were consistent \nwith the overall study population.\n\nGENERATION was a 52-week glycaemic control study in 720 elderly patients, the mean age was \n72.6 years; 433 subjects (60.1%) were < 75 years of age, and 287 subjects (39.9%) were ≥ 75 years of \nage. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c < 7% without confirmed or \nsevere hypoglycaemia. There appeared to be no difference in percentage responders: 37.9% \n(saxagliptin) and 38.2% (glimepiride) achieved the primary endpoint. A lower proportion of patients \nin the saxagliptin group (44.7%) compared to the glimepiride group (54.7%) achieved an HbA1c \ntarget of 7.0%. A lower proportion of patients in the saxagliptin group (1.1%) compared to the \nglimepiride group (15.3%), experienced a confirmed or severe hypoglycaemic event.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKomboglyze in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that Komboglyze combination \ntablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding doses of saxagliptin and metformin \nhydrochloride as individual tablets.\n\nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nKomboglyze.\n\nSaxagliptin\nThe pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its major metabolite were similar in healthy subjects and in \npatients with type 2 diabetes. \n\nAbsorption\nSaxagliptin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in the fasted state, with maximum plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) of saxagliptin and its major metabolite attained within 2 and 4 hours (Tmax), \nrespectively. The Cmax and AUC values of saxagliptin and its major metabolite increased \nproportionally with the increment in the saxagliptin dose, and this dose-proportionality was observed \nin doses up to 400 mg. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean \nplasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 78 ng·h/mL and 214 ng·h/mL, \nrespectively. The corresponding plasma Cmax values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The \nintra-subject coefficients of variation for saxagliptin Cmax and AUC were less than 12%. \n\nThe inhibition of plasma DPP4 activity by saxagliptin for at least 24 hours after oral administration of \nsaxagliptin is due to high potency, high affinity, and extended binding to the active site.\n\nInteraction with food\nFood had relatively modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin in healthy subjects. \nAdministration with food (a high-fat meal) resulted in no change in saxagliptin Cmax and a 27% \nincrease in AUC compared with the fasted state. The time for saxagliptin to reach Cmax (Tmax) was \nincreased by approximately 0.5 hours with food compared with the fasted state. These changes were \nnot considered to be clinically meaningful.\n\nDistribution\nThe in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is negligible.\nThus, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment) are \nnot expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin.\n\n\n\n19\n\nBiotransformation\nThe biotransformation of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5).\nThe major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a selective, reversible, competitive DPP4 inhibitor, half as \npotent as saxagliptin.\n\nElimination\nThe mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite are 2.5 hours \nand 3.1 hours respectively, and the mean t1/2 value for plasma DPP4 inhibition was 26.9 hours. \nSaxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of \n14C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its major \nmetabolite, and total radioactivity respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin \n(230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (120 mL/min), \nsuggesting some active renal excretion. For the major metabolite, renal clearance values were \ncomparable to estimated glomerular filtration rate. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity \nwas recovered in faeces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or \nunabsorbed medicinal product from the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nLinearity\nThe Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin and its major metabolite increased proportionally to the saxagliptin \ndose. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its major metabolite was observed with \nrepeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence was observed in the \nclearance of saxagliptin and its major metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at \ndoses ranging from 2.5 mg to 400 mg.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nA single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a 10 mg oral dose \nof saxagliptin in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The study included patients with renal impairment classified on the basis of \ncreatinine clearance as mild (approximately GFR ≥ 45 to < 90 mL/min), moderate (approximately \nGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min), or severe (approximately GFR < 30 mL/min) renal impairment. The \nexposures to saxagliptin were 1.2-, 1.4- and 2.1-fold higher, respectively, and the exposures to \nBMS-510849 were 1.7-, 2.9- and 4.5-fold higher, respectively, than those observed in subjects with \nnormal renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe (Child-Pugh \nClass C) hepatic impairment the exposures to saxagliptin were 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.8-fold higher, \nrespectively, and the exposures to BMS-510849 were 22%, 7%, and 33% lower, respectively, than \nthose observed in healthy subjects.\n\nElderly (≥ 65 years)\nElderly patients (65-80 years) had about 60% higher saxagliptin AUC than young patients (18-40 \nyears). This is not considered clinically meaningful, therefore, no dose adjustment for this medicinal \nproduct is recommended on the basis of age alone.\n\nMetformin\nAbsorption\nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg \nmetformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral dose, the non-absorbed \nfraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%.\n\nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear. At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n1 μg/mL. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n4 μg/mL, even at maximum doses.\n\n\n\n20\n\nInteraction with food\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin. Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min \nprolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed. The clinical relevance of this \ndecrease is unknown.\n\nDistribution\nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean Vd ranged between 63-276 L.\n\nBiotransformation\nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.\n\nElimination\nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 mL/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 h. When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to \nthat of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCo-administration of saxagliptin and metformin\nA 3-month dog study and embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits have been conducted \nwith the combination of saxagliptin and metformin. \n\nCo-administration of saxagliptin and metformin, to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of \norganogenesis, was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic in either species when tested at doses \nyielding systemic exposures (AUC) up to 100 and 10 times the maximum recommended human doses \n(RHD; 5 mg saxagliptin and 2000 mg metformin), respectively, in rats; and 249 and 1.1 times the \nRHDs in rabbits. In rats, minor developmental toxicity was limited to an increased incidence of \ndelayed ossification (“wavy ribs”); associated maternal toxicity was limited to weight decrements of \n5-6% over the course of gestation days 13 through 18, and related reductions in maternal food \nconsumption. In rabbits, co-administration was poorly tolerated in many mothers, resulting in death, \nmoribundity or abortion. However, among surviving mothers with evaluable litters, maternal toxicity \nwas limited to marginal reductions in body weight over the course of gestation days 21 to 29; and \nassociated developmental toxicity in these litters was limited to foetal body weight decrements of 7%, \nand a low incidence of delayed ossification of the foetal hyoid.\n\nA 3-month dog study was conducted with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin. No \ncombination toxicity was observed at AUC exposures 68 and 1.5 times the RHDs for saxagliptin and \nmetformin, respectively.\n\nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combination of products in Komboglyze to evaluate \ncarcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The following data are based on the findings \nin the studies with saxagliptin and metformin individually.\n\nSaxagliptin\nIn cynomolgus monkeys saxagliptin produced reversible skin lesions (scabs, ulcerations and necrosis) \nin extremities (tail, digits, scrotum and/or nose) at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg/day. The no effect level (NOEL) \nfor the lesions is 1 and 2 times the human exposure of saxagliptin and the major metabolite \nrespectively, at the recommended human dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. \n\nThe clinical relevance of the skin lesions is not known, however, clinical correlates to skin lesions in \nmonkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin.\n\n\n\n21\n\nImmune related findings of minimal, nonprogressive, lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen, lymph nodes \nand bone marrow with no adverse sequelae have been reported in all species tested at exposures \nstarting from 7 times the RHD.\n\nSaxagliptin produced gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs, including bloody/mucoid faeces and \nenteropathy at higher doses with a NOEL 4 and 2 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the \nmajor metabolite, respectively, at RHD.\n\nSaxagliptin was not genotoxic in a conventional battery of genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo. No \ncarcinogenic potential was observed in two-year carcinogenicity assays with mice and rats.\n\nEffects on fertility were observed in male and female rats at high doses producing overt signs of \ntoxicity. Saxagliptin was not teratogenic at any doses evaluated in rats or rabbits. At high doses in rats, \nsaxagliptin caused reduced ossification (a developmental delay) of the foetal pelvis and decreased \nfoetal body weight (in the presence of maternal toxicity), with a NOEL 303 and 30 times the human \nexposure for saxagliptin and the major metabolite, respectively, at RHD. In rabbits, the effects of \nsaxagliptin were limited to minor skeletal variations observed only at maternally toxic doses (NOEL \n158 and 224 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the major metabolite, respectively at RHD). \nIn a pre- and post-natal developmental study in rats, saxagliptin caused decreased pup weight at \nmaternally toxic doses, with NOEL 488 and 45 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the\nmajor metabolite, respectively at RHD. The effect on offspring body weights were noted until \npostnatal day 92 and 120 in females and males, respectively.\n\nMetformin\nPreclinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n39\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nKomboglyze 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nsaxagliptin/metformin hydrochloride\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Komboglyze is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Komboglyze\n3. How to take Komboglyze\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Komboglyze\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Komboglyze is and what it is used for\n\nThis medicine contains two different substances called:\n\nsaxagliptin, part of a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), \nand metformin, part of a class of medicines called biguanides.\n\nBoth belong to a group of medicines called oral anti-diabetics. \n\nWhat Komboglyze is used for\nThis medicine is used to treat a type of diabetes called ‘type 2 diabetes’.\n\nHow Komboglyze works\nSaxagliptin and metformin work together to control your blood sugar. They increase the levels of \ninsulin after a meal. They also lower the amount of sugar made by your body. Along with diet and \nexercise, this helps lower your blood sugar. This medicine can be used alone or together with other\nantidiabetic medicines, including insulin.\n\nTo control your diabetes, you still need to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this medicine. \nSo it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor or nurse.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Komboglyze\n\nDo not take Komboglyze\n- If you are allergic to saxagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6);\n- If you have had a serious allergic (hypersensitive) reaction to any other similar medications that \n\nyou take to control your blood sugar.\nSymptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include:\n\n- Rash\n- Raised red patches on your skin (hives)\n\n\n\n40\n\n- Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or \nswallowing.\n\nIf you have these symptoms, stop taking this medicine and call your doctor or nurse right \naway.\n\n If you have ever had a diabetic coma;\n If you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic \nacidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ‘ketone \nbodies’ accumulate in the blood and which can lead to a diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell;\n\n If you have severely reduced kidney function or problems with your liver;\n If you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your \n\nblood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems;\n If you have a severe infection or are dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your body);\n If you are breast-feeding (see also “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”);\n If you drink a large amount of alcohol (either every day or only from time to time) (please see \n\nsection “Komboglyze with alcohol”);\n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions:\nRisk of lactic acidosis\nKomboglyze may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if \nyour kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).\nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Komboglyze for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Komboglyze and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you \nexperience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include:\n\n vomiting\n stomach ache (abdominal pain)\n muscle cramps\n a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness\n difficulty in breathing\n reduced body temperature and heartbeat\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Komboglyze\n If you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin). This medicine should not \n\nbe used to treat this condition;\n If you have or have had a disease of the pancreas;\n If you are taking insulin or an antidiabetic medicine known as ‘sulphonylurea’, your doctor may \n\nwant to reduce your dose of insulin or the sulphonylurea when you take either of them together \nwith this medicine, in order to avoid low blood sugar;\n\n If you have had allergic reactions to any other medicines that you take to control the amount of \nsugar in your blood;\n\n If you have a problem or take a medicine that can lower your body’s defence against infections; \n\n\n\n41\n\n If you have ever had heart failure or you have other risk factors for developing heart failure such \nas problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart \nfailure. You should call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of \nthese symptoms. Symptoms can include, but are not limited to, increasing shortness of breath, \nrapid increase in weight and swelling of the feet (pedal oedema);\n\nIf you need to have major surgery, you must stop taking Komboglyze during and for some time after \nthe procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nKomboglyze.\n\nDiabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. Rash has been seen with saxagliptin and \nwith certain anti-diabetic medicines in the same class as saxagliptin. Follow the recommendations for \nskin and foot care that your doctor or nurse gave you. Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering \nof the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to\nstop Komboglyze.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nthis medicine.\n\nKidney tests or checks\nDuring treatment with this medicine, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year \nor more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nKomboglyze is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. It is not known if \nthis medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Komboglyze\nIf you need to have an injection of contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Komboglyze before or at the time of \nthe injection. Your doctor will decide when you can restart your treatment with Komboglyze.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may \nadjust the dosage of Komboglyze. It is especially important to mention the following:\n cimetidine, a medicine used to treat stomach problems\n ketoconazole which is used to treat fungal infections\n bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma\n diltiazem which is used for high blood pressure \n rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis \n corticosteroids, which are used to treat inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis\n carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin, which are used to control fits (seizures) or \n\nlong-term pain\n medicines which increase urine production (diuretics)\n medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen \n\nand celecoxib)\n certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists).\n\nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nthis medicine.\n\nKomboglyze with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Komboglyze since this may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis (see “Warnings and precautions”).\n\n\n\n42\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it may affect \nthe baby.\n\nDo not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. This is because metformin \npasses into human milk in small amounts.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSaxagliptin and metformin have a negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\nHypoglycaemia may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work with safe foothold and there \nis a risk of hypoglycaemia when taking this medicine in combination with medicines known to cause \nhypoglycaemia such as insulin and sulphonylureas.\n\n3. How to take Komboglyze\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n\nIf your doctor prescribes this medicine together with a sulphonylurea or insulin, remember to take this \nother medicine as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health.\n\nHow much to take\n The amount of this medicine that you will take varies depending on your condition and the doses \n\nyou currently take of metformin and/or individual tablets of saxagliptin and metformin. Your \ndoctor will tell you exactly the dose of this medicine to take.\n\n The recommended dosing is one tablet twice a day. \nIf you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\nHow to take this medicine\n Take this medicine by mouth.\n Take with a meal to lower your chance of getting an upset stomach.\n\nDiet and exercise\nTo control your diabetes, you still need to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this medicine. \nSo it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor or nurse. In \nparticular, if you are following a diabetic weight control diet, keep on with this while you are taking \nthis medicine. \n\nIf you take more Komboglyze than you should\nIf you take more Komboglyze tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight \naway. Take the medicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take Komboglyze\n If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is \n\ntime for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. \n Do not take a double dose of this medicine to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\nIf you stop taking Komboglyze\nKeep taking this medicine until your doctor tells you to stop. This is to help keep your blood sugar \nunder control.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n\n\n43\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nStop taking Komboglyze and contact a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following \nserious side effects:\n Lactic acidosis, Komboglyze may cause a very rare (may affect up to 1 user in 10,000), but very \n\nserious side effect called lactic acidosis (see section “Warnings and precautions”). If this happens \nyou must stop taking Komboglyze and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately, \nas lactic acidosis may lead to coma.\n\n Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your \nback, as well as nausea and vomiting, as it could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis).\n\nYou should call your doctor if you experience the following side effects:\n severe joint pain.\n\nOther side effects of Komboglyze include:\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n headache \n muscle pain (myalgia)\n being sick or indigestion (dyspepsia)\n infection of the structures that carry urine (urinary tract infection)\n infection of the upper airways\n inflamed nose or throat such as with a cold or sore throat\n inflamed stomach (gastritis) or gut, sometimes caused by an infection (gastroenteritis)\n infection of your sinuses, sometimes with a feeling of pain and fullness behind your cheeks and \n\neyes (sinusitis)\n flatulence\n dizziness\n tiredness (fatigue).\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n joint pain (arthralgia)\n difficulties in getting or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction).\n\nSide effects seen when taking saxagliptin alone: \nCommon\n dizziness\n tiredness (fatigue).\n\nSide effects seen when taking saxagliptin alone or in combination: \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n constipation \n blistering of the skin (bullous pemphigoid)\n\nSome patients have had a small reduction in the number of one type of white blood cells \n(lymphocytes) shown in a blood test when saxagliptin was used alone or in combination.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Komboglyze is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Komboglyze\n3. How to take Komboglyze\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Komboglyze\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Komboglyze is and what it is used for\n\nThis medicine contains two different substances called:\n\nsaxagliptin, part of a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), \nand metformin, part of a class of medicines called biguanides.\n\nBoth belong to a group of medicines called oral anti-diabetics. \n\nWhat Komboglyze is used for\nThis medicine is used to treat a type of diabetes called ‘type 2 diabetes’.\n\nHow Komboglyze works\nSaxagliptin and metformin work together to control your blood sugar. They increase the levels of \ninsulin after a meal. They also lower the amount of sugar made by your body. Along with diet and \nexercise, this helps lower your blood sugar. This medicine can be used alone or together with other\nantidiabetic medicines, including insulin.\n\nTo control your diabetes, you still need to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this medicine. \nSo it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor or nurse.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Komboglyze\n\nDo not take Komboglyze\n- If you are allergic to saxagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6);\n- If you have had a serious allergic (hypersensitive) reaction to any other similar medications that \n\nyou take to control your blood sugar.\nSymptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include:\n\n- Rash\n- Raised red patches on your skin (hives)\n\n\n\n48\n\n- Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or \nswallowing.\n\nIf you have these symptoms, stop taking this medicine and call your doctor or nurse right \naway.\n\n If you have ever had a diabetic coma;\n If you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic \nacidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ‘ketone \nbodies’ accumulate in the blood and which can lead to a diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell;\n\n If you have severely reduced kidney function or problems with your liver;\n If you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your \n\nblood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems;\n If you have a severe infection or are dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your body);\n If you are breast-feeding (see also “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”);\n If you drink a large amount of alcohol (either every day or only from time to time) (please see \n\nsection “Komboglyze with alcohol”);\n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions:\nRisk of lactic acidosis\nKomboglyze may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if \nyour kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).\nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Komboglyze for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Komboglyze and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you \nexperience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include:\n\n vomiting\n stomach ache (abdominal pain)\n muscle cramps\n a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness\n difficulty in breathing\n reduced body temperature and heartbeat\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Komboglyze\n If you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin). This medicine should not \n\nbe used to treat this condition;\n If you have or have had a disease of the pancreas;\n If you are taking insulin or an antidiabetic medicine known as ‘sulphonylurea’, your doctor may \n\nwant to reduce your dose of insulin or the sulphonylurea when you take either of them together \nwith this medicine, in order to avoid low blood sugar;\n\n If you have had allergic reactions to any other medicines that you take to control the amount of \nsugar in your blood;\n\n If you have a problem or take a medicine that can lower your body’s defence against infections; \n\n\n\n49\n\n If you have ever had heart failure or you have other risk factors for developing heart failure such \nas problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart \nfailure. You should call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of \nthese symptoms. Symptoms can include, but are not limited to, increasing shortness of breath, \nrapid increase in weight and swelling of the feet (pedal oedema);\n\nIf you need to have major surgery, you must stop taking Komboglyze during and for some time after \nthe procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nKomboglyze.\n\nDiabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. Rash has been seen with saxagliptin and \nwith certain anti-diabetic medicines in the same class as saxagliptin. Follow the recommendations for \nskin and foot care that your doctor or nurse gave you. Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering \nof the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to \nstop Komboglyze.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nthis medicine.\n\nKidney tests or checks\nDuring treatment with this medicine, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year \nor more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nKomboglyze is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. It is not known if \nthis medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Komboglyze\nIf you need to have an injection of contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Komboglyze before or at the time of \nthe injection. Your doctor will decide when you can restart your treatment with Komboglyze.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may \nadjust the dosage of Komboglyze. It is especially important to mention the following:\n cimetidine, a medicine used to treat stomach problems\n ketoconazole which is used to treat fungal infections\n bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma\n diltiazem which is used for high blood pressure \n rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis \n corticosteroids, which are used to treat inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis\n carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin, which are used to control fits (seizures) or \n\nlong-term pain\n medicines which increase urine production (diuretics)\n medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen \n\nand celecoxib)\n certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists).\n\nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nthis medicine.\n\nKomboglyze with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Komboglyze since this may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis (see “Warnings and precautions”).\n\n\n\n50\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it may affect \nthe baby.\n\nDo not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. This is because metformin \npasses into human milk in small amounts.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSaxagliptin and metformin have a negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHypoglycaemia may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work with safe foothold and there \nis a risk of hypoglycaemia when taking this medicine in combination with medicines known to cause \nhypoglycaemia such as insulin and sulphonylureas.\n\n3.

In \nparticular, if you are following a diabetic weight control diet, keep on with this while you are taking \nthis medicine. \n\nIf you take more Komboglyze than you should\nIf you take more Komboglyze tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight \naway. Take the medicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take Komboglyze\n If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember.
