during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose . this is partly linked to restored health and life style , and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves . your doctor will test for these changes . treatment with combivir often causes a loss of fat from legs , arms and face ( lipoatrophy ). this loss of body fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine . your doctor should monitor for signs of lipoatrophy . tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs , arms , and face . when these signs occur , combivir should be stopped and your hiv treatment changed . like all medicines , this medicine can cause side effects , but not everyone gets them . when you are being treated for hiv , it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of combivir or other medicines you are taking , or an effect of the hiv disease itself . so it is very important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health . as well as the side effects listed below for combivir , other conditions can develop during combination therapy for hiv . it is important to read the information later in this section under ' other possible side effects of combination therapy for hiv '. very common side effects these may affect more than than 1 in 10 people : 35 headache feeling sick ( nausea ). common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people : being sick ( vomiting ) diarrhoea stomach pains loss of appetite feeling dizzy tiredness , lack of energy fever ( high temperature ) general feeling of being unwell difficulty in sleeping ( insomnia ) muscle pain and discomfort joint pain cough irritated or runny nose skin rash hair loss ( alopecia ). common side effects that might show up in blood tests are : a low red blood cell count ( anaemia ) or low white blood cell count ( neutropenia or leucopenia ) an increase in the level of liver enzymes an increased amount in the blood of bilirubin ( a substance produced in the liver ) which may make your skin appear yellow . uncommon side effects these may affect up to 1 in 100 people : feeling breathless wind ( flatulence ) itching muscle weakness . an uncommon side effect that may show up in blood test is : a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting ( thrombocytopenia ) or in all kinds of blood cells ( pancytopenia ). rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 1000 people : serious allergic reaction causing swelling of the face , tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing liver disorders , such as jaundice , enlarged liver or fatty liver , inflammation ( hepatitis ) lactic acidosis ( excess lactic acid in the blood ;

if it happens , it usually develops after a few months of treatment . it can be life - threatening , causing failure of internal organs . lactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease , or in obese ( very overweight ) people , especially women . signs of lactic acidosis include : deep , rapid , difficult breathing drowsiness numbness or weakness in the limbs feeling sick ( nausea ), being sick ( vomiting ) stomach pain . during your treatment , your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis . if you have any of the symptoms listed above , or any other symptoms that worry you : see your doctor as soon as possible . you may have problems with your bones some people taking combination therapy for hiv develop a condition called osteonecrosis . with this condition , parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone . people may be more likely to get this condition : if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time if they are also taking anti - inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids if they drink alcohol if their immune systems are very weak if they are overweight . signs of osteonecrosis include : stiffness in the joints aches and pains ( especially in the hip , knee or shoulder ) difficulty moving . if you notice any of these symptoms : tell your doctor . other effects may show up in blood tests combination therapy for hiv can also cause : increased levels of lactic acid in the blood , which on rare occasions can lead to lactic acidosis reporting of side effects if you get any side effects , talk to your doctor or pharmacist . this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet . you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v . by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine .
