NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nJentadueto 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nJentadueto 2.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nJentadueto 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nEach tablet contains 2.5 mg of linagliptin and 850 mg of metformin hydrochloride.\n\nJentadueto 2.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets\nEach tablet contains 2.5 mg of linagliptin and 1,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nJentadueto 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets\nOval, biconvex, light orange, film-coated tablet of 19.2 mm x 9.4 mm debossed with \"D2/850\" on one \nside and the company logo on the other.\n\nJentadueto 2.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets\nOval, biconvex, light pink, film-coated tablet of 21.1 mm x 9.7 mm debossed with ”D2/1000\" on one \nside and the company logo on the other.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nJentadueto is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \nimprove glycaemic control:\n\n• in patients inadequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone \n\n• in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, in \npatients inadequately controlled with metformin and these medicinal products\n\n• in patients already being treated with the combination of linagliptin and metformin as separate \ntablets.\n\n(see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nAdults with normal renal function (GFR ≥90 ml/min)\nThe dose of antihyperglycaemic therapy with Jentadueto should be individualised on the basis of the \npatient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum \nrecommended daily dose of 5 mg linagliptin plus 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride.\n\nPatients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy \nFor patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Jentadueto\nshould provide linagliptin dosed as 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of \nmetformin already being taken.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPatients switching from co-administration of linagliptin and metformin\nFor patients switching from co-administration of linagliptin and metformin, Jentadueto should be \ninitiated at the dose of linagliptin and metformin already being taken.\n\nPatients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of\nmetformin and a sulphonylurea\nThe dose of Jentadueto should provide linagliptin dosed as 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose) \nand a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When linagliptin plus metformin \nhydrochloride is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be \nrequired to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with insulin and the maximal tolerated \ndose of metformin\nThe dose of Jentadueto should provide linagliptin dosed as 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose) \nand a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When linagliptin plus metformin \nhydrochloride is used in combination with insulin, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nFor the different doses of metformin, Jentadueto is available in strengths of 2.5 mg linagliptin plus\n850 mg metformin hydrochloride and 2.5 mg linagliptin plus 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride. \n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nAs metformin is excreted by the kidney, Jentadueto should be used with caution as age increases.\nMonitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, \nparticularly in the elderly (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing products and at \nleast annually thereafter. In patients at an increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and \nin the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months.\nFactors that may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see 4.4) should be reviewed before considering \ninitiation of metformin in patients with GFR<60 ml/min.\nIf no adequate strength of Jentadueto is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead \nof the fixed dose combination.\n\n\n\n4\n\nTable 1: Posology for renally impaired patients\n\nGFR ml/min Metformin Linagliptin\n\n60-89 Maximum daily dose is 3000 mg.\nDose reduction may be considered \nin relation to declining renal \nfunction.\n\nNo dose adjustment\n\n45-59 Maximum daily dose is 2000 mg\nThe starting dose is at most half of \nthe maximum dose.\n\nNo dose adjustment\n\n30-44 Maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of \nthe maximum dose.\n\nNo dose adjustment\n\n<30 Metformin is contraindicated No dose adjustment\n\nHepatic impairment\nJentadueto is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment due to the active substance \nmetformin (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). Clinical experience with Jentadueto in patients with hepatic \nimpairment is lacking.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Jentadueto in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration\nJentadueto should be taken twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions\nassociated with metformin.\nAll patients should continue their diet with an adequate distribution of carbohydrate intake during the \nday. Overweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet.\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. However, a double dose \nshould not be taken at the same time. In that case, the missed dose should be skipped. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n• Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis)\n• Diabetic pre-coma.\n• Severe renal failure (GFR <30 ml/min).\n• Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: dehydration, severe infection, \n\nshock.\n• Disease which may cause tissue hypoxia (especially acute disease, or worsening of chronic \n\ndisease) such as: decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, \nshock.\n\n• Hepatic impairment, acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nJentadueto should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\n\n\n5\n\nHypoglycaemia\nWhen linagliptin was added to a sulphonylurea on a background of metformin, the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was increased over that of placebo.\n\nSulphonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, caution is advised when \nJentadueto is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin. A dose reduction of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered (see section 4.2).\n\nHypoglycaemia is not identified as adverse reaction for linagliptin, metformin, or linagliptin plus \nmetformin. In clinical trials, the incidence rates of hypoglycemia were comparably low in patients \ntaking linagliptin in combination with metformin or metformin alone.\n\nLactic acidosis\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.\n\nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should \nbe temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.\n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nNSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic \nacidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, \nprolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts that may cause lactic acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia followed \nby coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (<7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels (>5 mmol/l) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.\n\nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be \ndiscontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable, see sections 4.2 and \n4.5.\n\nRenal function\nGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter, see section 4.2. Metformin \nis contraindicated in patients with GFR<30 ml/min and should be temporarily discontinued in the \npresence of conditions that alter renal function, see section 4.3).\n\nCardiac function\nPatients with heart failure are more at risk of hypoxia and renal impairment. In patients with stable \nchronic heart failure, Jentadueto may be used with a regular monitoring of cardiac and renal function.\nFor patients with acute and unstable heart failure, Jentadueto is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nSurgery\nMetformin must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal or epidural anesthesia. \nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition \nand provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\n\nElderly\nCaution should be exercised when treating patients 80 years and older (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n6\n\nChange in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes\nAs Jentadueto contains metformin, a patient with previously well controlled type 2 diabetes on \nJentadueto who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly \ndefined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. \nEvaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, \nlactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, Jentadueto must be stopped \nimmediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Acute \npancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In a cardiovascular and renal safety study \n(CARMELINA) with median observation period of 2.2 years, adjudicated acute pancreatitis was \nreported in 0.3% of patients treated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.\nPatients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, Jentadueto should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Jentadueto should not \nbe restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nBullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In the CARMELINA study, \nbullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients on treatment with linagliptin and in no patient on \nplacebo. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Jentadueto should be discontinued.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. However, such studies have been conducted with the \nindividual active substances, i.e. linagliptin and metformin. Co-administration of multiple doses of \nlinagliptin and metformin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either linagliptin or \nmetformin in healthy volunteers and patients. \n\nLinagliptin\nIn vitro assessment of interactions\nLinagliptin is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme \nCYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes.\n\nLinagliptin is a P-glycoprotein substrate, and inhibits P-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin \nwith low potency. Based on these results and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered \nunlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates.\n\nIn vivo assessment of interactions\nEffects of other medicinal products on linagliptin\nClinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by \ncoadministered medicinal products is low. \n\nMetformin:\nCo-administration of multiple three-times-daily doses of 850 mg metformin hydrochloride with 10 mg \nlinagliptin once daily did not clinical meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in healthy \nsubjects. \n\nSulphonylureas:\nThe steady-state pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin were not changed by concomitant \nadministration of a single 1.75 mg dose glibenclamide (glyburide).\n\n\n\n7\n\nRitonavir:\nCo-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses of ritonavir, \na potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, increased the AUC and Cmax of linagliptin \napproximately twofold and threefold, respectively. The unbound concentrations, which are usually less \nthan 1% at the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4-5-fold after co-administration with \nritonavir. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and without ritonavir \nindicated that the increase in exposure will not be associated with an increased accumulation. These \nchanges in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, \nclinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nRifampicin:\nMultiple co-administration of 5 mg linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inductor of P-glycoprotein and \nCYP3A4, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC and Cmax\nrespectively, and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough. Thus full efficacy of linagliptin in \ncombination with strong P-gp inducers might not be achieved, particularly if these are administered \nlong-term. Co-administration with other potent inducers of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin has not been studied.\n\nEffects of linagliptin on other medicinal products\nIn clinical studies, as described below, linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives \nproviding in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-glycoprotein, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).\n\nMetformin:\nCo-administration of multiple daily doses of 10 mg linagliptin with 850 mg metformin hydrochloride, \nan OCT substrate, had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy subjects. \nTherefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT-mediated transport.\n\nSulphonylureas:\nCo-administration of multiple oral doses of 5 mg linagliptin and a single oral dose of 1.75 mg \nglibenclamide (glyburide) resulted in clinically not relevant reduction of 14% of both AUC and Cmax\nof glibenclamide. Because glibenclamide is primarily metabolised by CYP2C9, these data also support \nthe conclusion that linagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Clinically meaningful interactions would not \nbe expected with other sulphonylureas (e.g., glipizide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride) which, like \nglibenclamide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9. \n\nDigoxin:\nCo-administration of multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin with multiple doses of 0.25 mg digoxin \nhad no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy subjects. Therefore, linagliptin is not an \ninhibitor of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.\n\nWarfarin:\nMultiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of S(-) or R(+) warfarin, a \nCYP2C9 substrate, administered in a single dose.\n\nSimvastatin:\nMultiple daily doses of linagliptin had a minimal effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of \nsimvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy subjects. Following administration of a \nsupratherapeutic dose of 10 mg linagliptin concomitantly with 40 mg of simvastatin daily for 6 days, \nthe plasma AUC of simvastatin was increased by 34%, and the plasma Cmax by 10%.\n\nOral contraceptives:\nCo-administration with 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of \nlevonorgestrel or ethinylestradiol.\n\n\n\n8\n\nMetformin\nCombination requiring precautions for use\nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the \ndose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and on its discontinuation.\n\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \nproducts in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.\n\nOrganic cation transporters (OCT)\nMetformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Co-administration of metformin with\n• Inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin.\n• Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy of \n\nmetformin.\n• Inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, \n\nisavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in \nmetformin plasma concentration.\n\n• Inhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efficacy and renal \nelimination of metformin.\n\nCaution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these drugs are \ncoadministered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase. If needed, dose \nadjustment of metformin may be considered as OCT inhibitors/inducers may alter the efficacy of \nmetformin.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\nAlcohol\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment. \n\nIodinated contrast agents\nJentadueto must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until \nat least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable, see\nsections 4.2 and 4.4. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThe use of linagliptin has not been studied in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nA limited amount of data suggests that the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with \nan increased risk of congenital malformations. Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful \neffects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\nNon-clinical reproduction studies did not indicate an additive teratogenic effect attributed to the co-\nadministration of linagliptin and metformin.\nJentadueto should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient plans to become pregnant, or if \npregnancy occurs, treatment with Jentadueto should be discontinued and switched to insulin treatment \nas soon as possible in order to lower the risk of foetal malformations associated with abnormal blood \nglucose levels.\n\nBreast-feeding\nStudies in animals have shown excretion of both metformin and linagliptin into milk in lactating rats. \nMetformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts. It is not known whether linagliptin is excreted \n\n\n\n9\n\ninto human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from Jentadueto therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of Jentadueto on human fertility has not been studied. No adverse effects of linagliptin on \nfertility were observed in male or female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nJentadueto has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients \nshould be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Jentadueto is used in combination with other anti-\ndiabetic medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. sulphonylureas).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (or its bioequivalent of 5 mg once daily) in combination \nwith metformin has been evaluated in over 6800 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In placebo-\ncontrolled studies, more than 1800 patients were treated with the therapeutic dose of either 2.5 mg \nlinagliptin twice daily (or its bioequivalent of 5 mg linagliptin once daily) in combination with \nmetformin for ≥ 12/24 weeks.\n\nIn the pooled analysis of the seven placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of adverse events in \npatients treated with placebo and metformin was comparable to that seen with linagliptin 2.5 mg and \nmetformin (54.3 and 49.0%). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was comparable in \npatients who received placebo and metformin to patients treated with linagliptin and metformin (3.8% \nand 2.9%).\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction for linagliptin plus metformin was diarrhoea (1.6%) \nwith a comparable rate on metformin plus placebo (2.4%).\n\nHypoglycaemia may occur when Jentadueto is administered together with sulphonylurea (≥ 1 case per \n10 patients).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions reported in all clinical trials with the linagliptin+metformin combination or the use \nof the monocomponents (linagliptin or metformin) in clinical trials or from post-marketing experience\nare shown below according to system organ class. Adverse reactions previously reported with one of \nthe individual active substances may be potential adverse reactions with Jentadueto, even if not \nobserved in clinical trials with this medicinal product.\n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and absolute frequency.

Refer to Summary of Product Characteristics for metformin for additional information\n1 Adverse reaction observed in combination of Jentadueto with sulphonylurea\n2 Adverse reaction observed in combination of Jentadueto with insulin\n\n\n\n11\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nHypoglycaemia\nIn one study linagliptin was given as add-on to metformin plus sulphonylurea. When linagliptin and \nmetformin were administered in combination with a sulphonylurea, hypoglycaemia was the most \nfrequently reported adverse event (linagliptin plus metformin plus sulphonylurea 23.9% and 16.0% in \nplacebo plus metformin plus sulphonylurea).\n\nWhen linagliptin and metformin were administered in combination with insulin, hypoglycaemia was \nthe most frequently reported adverse event, but occurred at comparable rate when placebo and \nmetformin were combined with insulin (linagliptin plus metformin plus insulin 29.5% and 30.9% in \nthe placebo plus metformin plus insulin group) with a low rate of severe (requiring assistance)\nepisodes (1.5% and 0.9%).\n\nOther adverse reactions\nGastrointestinal disorders such as, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and decreased appetite and abdominal \npain occur most frequently during initiation of therapy with Jentadueto or metformin hydrochloride \nand resolve spontaneously in most cases. For prevention, it is recommended that Jentadueto be taken \nduring or after meals. A slow increase in dose of metformin hydrochloride may also improve \ngastrointestinal tolerability. \nLong-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption \nwhich may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. megaloblastic \nanaemia).\n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA)\nThe CARMELINA study evaluated the cardiovascular and renal safety of linagliptin versus placebo in \npatients with type 2 diabetes and with increased CV risk evidenced by a history of established \nmacrovascular or renal disease (see section 5.1). The study included 3494 patients treated with \nlinagliptin (5 mg) and 3485 patients treated with placebo. Both treatments were added to standard of\ncare targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The overall incidence of adverse \nevents and serious adverse events in patients receiving linagliptin was similar to that in patients \nreceiving placebo. Safety data from this study was in line with previous known safety profile of \nlinagliptin.\n\nIn the treated population, severe hypoglycaemic events (requiring assistance) were reported in 3.0% of \npatients on linagliptin and in 3.1% on placebo. Among patients who were using sulfonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.0% in linagliptin-treated patients and 1.7% in \nplacebo treated patients. Among patients who were using insulin at baseline, the incidence of severe \nhypoglycaemia was 4.4% in linagliptin-treated patients and 4.9% in placebo treated patients.\n\nIn the overall study observation period adjudicated acute pancreatitis was reported in 0.3% of patients \ntreated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.\n\nIn the CARMELINA study, bullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients treated with \nlinagliptin and in no patient treated with placebo.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nLinagliptin\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 600 mg linagliptin \n(equivalent to 120 times the recommended dose) were not associated with a dose dependent increase \nin adverse events. There is no experience with doses above 600 mg in humans.\n\nMetformin\nHypoglycaemia has not been seen with metformin hydrochloride doses of up to 85 g, although lactic \nacidosis has occurred in such circumstances. High overdose of metformin hydrochloride or \nconcomitant risks may lead to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be \ntreated in hospital. The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin hydrochloride is \nhaemodialysis.\n\nManagement\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g. remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute clinical \nmeasures if required.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD11\n\nJentadueto combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with complementary mechanisms of \naction to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase \n4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.\n\nLinagliptin\nMechanism of action\nLinagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase 4) an enzyme which is involved \nin the inactivation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-\ndependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the enzyme DPP-4. \nBoth incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretins \nare secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. \nGLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence \nof normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from \npancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Linagliptin binds very \neffectively to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus leads to a sustained increase and a prolongation \nof active incretin levels. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers \nglucagon secretion thus resulting in an overall improvement in the glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin \nbinds selectively to DPP-4 and exhibits a > 10,000 fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in\nvitro.\n\nMetformin\nMechanism of action\nMetformin hydrochloride is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and\npostprandial plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce \nhypoglycaemia. \n\nMetformin hydrochloride may act via 3 mechanisms: \n\n(1) reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis,\n(2) in muscle, by increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation,\n\n\n\n13\n\n(3) and delay of intestinal glucose absorption. \n\nMetformin hydrochloride stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. \nMetformin hydrochloride increases the transport capacity of all types of membrane glucose \ntransporters (GLUTs) known to date. \n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin hydrochloride has favourable effects \non lipid metabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-\nterm clinical studies: metformin hydrochloride reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and \ntriglyceride levels.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nLinagliptin as add-on to metformin therapy\nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin in combination with metformin in patients with insufficient \nglycaemic control on metformin monotherapy was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled \nstudy of 24 weeks duration. Linagliptin added to metformin provided significant improvements in \nHbA1c, (-0.64% change compared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8%. Linagliptin also \nshowed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by -21.1 mg/dl and 2-hour post-\nprandial glucose (PPG) by -67.1 mg/dl compared to placebo, as well as a greater portion of patients \nachieving a target HbA1c of < 7.0% (28.3% on linagliptin versus 11.4% on placebo). The observed \nincidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo. Body weight \ndid not differ significantly between the groups.\n\nIn a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily in \ncombination with metformin (500 mg or 1,000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in \nglycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy as summarised in Table 3 (mean baseline \nHbA1c 8.65%). \n\nTable 3: Glycaemic parameters at final visit (24-week study) for linagliptin and metformin, alone \nand in combination in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on \ndiet and exercise\n\nPlacebo Linagliptin \n5 mg Once \n\nDaily\n1\n\nMetformin\nHCl\n500 mg \nTwice \nDaily\n\nLinagliptin \n2.5 mg\n\nTwice Daily\n1\n\n+ \n\nMetformin HCl\n500 mg \nTwice Daily\n\nMetformin \nHCl\n1,000 mg \nTwice \nDaily\n\nLinagliptin 2.5 mg\n\nTwice Daily\n1\n\n+ \nMetformin HCl \n1,000 mg \nTwice Daily\n\nHbA1c (%)\nNumber of patients n = 65 n = 135 n = 141 n = 137 n = 138 n = 140\nBaseline (mean) 8.7 8.7 8.7 8.7 8.5 8.7\nChange from baseline (adjusted \nmean)\n\n0.1 -0.5 -0.6 -1.2 -1.1 -1.6\n\nDifference from placebo \n(adjusted mean) (95% CI)\n\n-- -0.6\n(-0.9, -0.3)\n\n-0.8\n(-1.0, -0.5)\n\n-1.3\n(-1.6, -1.1)\n\n-1.2 \n(-1.5, -0.9)\n\n-1.7\n(-2.0, -1.4)\n\nPatients (n, %) achieving HbA1c\n<7%\n\n7 (10.8) 14 (10.4) 27 ( 19.1) 42 (30.7) 43 (31.2) 76 (54.3)\n\nPatients (%) receiving rescue \ntreatment\n\n29.2 11.1 13.5 7.3 8.0 4.3\n\nFPG (mg/dL)\nNumber of patients n = 61 n = 134 n = 136 n = 135 n = 132 n = 136\nBaseline (mean) 203 195 191 199 191 196\nChange from baseline (adjusted \nmean)\n\n10 -9 -16 -33 -32 -49\n\nDifference from placebo \n(adjusted mean) (95% CI)\n\n-- -19\n(-31, -6)\n\n-26\n(-38, -14)\n\n-43\n(-56, -31)\n\n-42 \n(-55, -30)\n\n-60\n(-72, -47)\n\n1 Total daily dose of linagliptin is equal to 5 mg\n\nMean reductions from baseline in HbA1c were generally greater for patients with higher baseline \nHbA1c values. Effects on plasma lipids were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight with the \ncombination of linagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed for metformin alone or placebo; \nthere was no change in weight from baseline for patients on linagliptin alone. The incidence of \n\n\n\n14\n\nhypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups (placebo 1.4%, linagliptin 5 mg 0%, metformin \n2.1%, and linagliptin 2.5 mg plus metformin twice daily 1.4%).\n\nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily versus 5 mg once daily in combination with \nmetformin in patients with insufficient glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy was evaluated in \na double-blind placebo-controlled study of 12 weeks duration. Linagliptin 5 mg once daily and 2.5 mg \ntwice daily provided comparable (CI: -0.07; 0.19) significant HbA1c reductions of -0.80% (from \nbaseline 7.98%), and -0.74% (from baseline 7.96%) compared to placebo. The observed incidence of \nhypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo. Body weight did not differ \nsignificantly between the groups.\n\nLinagliptin as add-on to a combination of metformin and sulphonylurea therapy\nA placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks in duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof linagliptin 5 mg to placebo, in patients not sufficiently treated with a combination with metformin \nand a sulphonylurea. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.62% change \ncompared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.14%. Linagliptin also showed significant \nimprovements in patients achieving a target HbA1c of < 7.0% (31.2% on linagliptin versus 9.2% on \nplacebo), and also for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with -12.7 mg/dl reduction compared to placebo.\nBody weight did not differ significantly between the groups.\n\nLinagliptin as add on to a combination of metformin and empagliflozin therapy\nIn patients inadequately controlled with metformin and empagliflozin (10 mg (n=247) or 25 mg \n(n=217)), 24-weeks treatment with add-on therapy of linagliptin 5 mg provided adjusted mean HbA1c \nreductions from baseline by -0.53% (significant difference to add-on placebo -0.32% (95% CI -0.52, \n-0.13) and -0.58% (significant difference to add-on placebo -0.47% (95% CI -0.66; -0.28), \nrespectively. A statistically significant greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% and \ntreated with linagliptin 5 mg achieved a target HbA1c of <7% compared to placebo.\n\nLinagliptin in combination with metformin and insulin\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin \n(5 mg once daily) added to insulin with or without metformin. 83% of patients were taking metformin \nin combination with insulin in this trial. Linagliptin in combination with metformin plus insulin \nprovided significant improvements in HbA1c in this subgroup with -0.68% (CI: -0.78; -0,57) adjusted \nmean change from baseline (mean baseline HbA1c 8.28%) compared to placebo in combination with \nmetformin plus insulin. There was no meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either \ngroup.\n\nLinagliptin 24 month data, as add-on to metformin in comparison with glimepiride \nIn a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of linagliptin 5 mg or glimepiride (mean \ndose 3 mg) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, mean reductions \nin HbA1c were -0.16% with linagliptin (mean baseline HbA1c 7.69%) and -0.36% with glimepiride \n(mean baseline HbA1c 7.69%.) with a mean treatment difference of 0.20% (97.5% CI: 0.09, 0.299). \nThe incidence of hypoglycaemia in the linagliptin group (7.5%) was significantly lower than that in \nthe glimepiride group (36.1%). Patients treated with linagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease \nfrom baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered \nglimepiride (-1.39 versus +1.29 kg). \n\nLinagliptin as add-on therapy in elderly (age ≥ 70 years) with type 2 diabetes\nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin in elderly (age ≥ 70 years) with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in \na double-blind study of 24 weeks duration. Patients received metformin and/or sulphonylurea and/or\ninsulin as background therapy. Doses of background anti-diabetic therapy were kept stable during the \nfirst 12 weeks, after which adjustments were permitted. Linagliptin provided significant improvements \nin HbA1c (-0.64% change compared to placebo after 24 weeks), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.8%. \nLinagliptin also showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to \nplacebo. Body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.\n\n\n\n15\n\nIn a pooled analysis of elderly (age ≥ 70 years) patients with type 2 diabetes (n=183) who were taking \nboth metformin and basal insulin as background therapy, linagliptin in combination with metformin \nplus insulin provided significant improvements in HbA1c parameters with -0.81% (CI: -1.01; -0.61) \nadjusted mean change from baseline (mean baseline HbA1c 8.13%) compared to placebo in \ncombination with metformin plus insulin. \n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA)\nCARMELINA was a randomized study in 6979 patients with type 2 diabetes with increased CV risk \nevidenced by a history of established macrovascular or renal disease who were treated with linagliptin \n5 mg (3494) or placebo (3485) added to standard of care targeting regional standards for HbA1c, CV \nrisk factors and renal disease. The study population included 1211 (17.4%) patients ≥ 75 years of age \nand 4348 (62.3%) patients with renal impairment. Approximately 19% of the population had eGFR \n≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 28% of the population had eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 15% \nhad eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0%.\n\nThe study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which \nwas a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction \n(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). The renal composite endpoint was defined as renal death or \nsustained end stage renal disease or sustained decrease of 40% or more in eGFR.\n\nAfter a median follow up of 2.2 years, linagliptin, when added to standard of care, did not increase the \nrisk of major adverse cardiovascular events or renal outcome events. There was no increased risk in \nhospitalization for heart failure which was an additional adjudicated endpoint observed compared to \nstandard of care without linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (table 4).\n\nTable 4: Cardiovascular and renal outcomes by treatment group in the CARMELINA study\n\nLinagliptin 5mg Placebo Hazard \nRatio\n\nNumber of \nSubjects (%)\n\nIncidence \nRate per 1000 \n\nPY*\n\nNumber of \nSubjects (%)\n\nIncidence \nRate per 1000 \n\nPY*\n\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber of patients 3494 3485\nPrimary CV \ncomposite \n(Cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal MI, \nnon-fatal stroke)\n\n434 (12.4) 57.7 420 (12.1) 56.3 1.02 (0.89, \n1.17)**\n\nSecondary renal \ncomposite (renal \ndeath, ESRD, 40% \nsustained decrease \nin eGFR)\n\n327 (9.4) 48.9 306 (8.8) 46.6 1.04 (0.89, \n1.22)\n\nAll-cause mortality 367 (10.5) 46.9 373 (10.7) 48.0 0.98 (0.84, \n1.13)\n\nCV death 255 (7.3) 32.6 264 (7.6) 34 0.96 (0.81, \n1.14)\n\nHospitalization for \nheart failure\n\n209 (6.0) 27.7 226 (6.5) 30.4 0.90 (0.74, \n1.08)\n\n* PY=patient years\n\n** Test on non-inferiority to demonstrate that the upper bound of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio is less than 1.3\n\n\n\n16\n\nIn analyses for albuminuria progression (change from normoalbuminuria to micro- or \nmacroalbuminuria, or from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria) the estimated hazard ratio was \n0.86 (95% CI 0.78, 0.95) for linagliptin versus placebo. \n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular safety study (CAROLINA) \nCAROLINA was a randomized study in 6033 patients with early type 2 diabetes and increased CV \nrisk or established complications who were treated with linagliptin 5 mg (3023) or glimepiride 1-4mg \n(3010) added to standard of care (including background therapy with metformin in 83% of patients) \ntargeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The mean age for study population was \n64 years and included 2030 (34%) patients ≥ 70 years of age. The study population included \n2089 (35%) patients with cardiovascular disease and 1130 (19%) patients with renal impairment with \nan eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m2 at baseline. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.15%.\n\nThe study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which \nwas a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction \n(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). \n\nAfter a median follow up of 6.25 years, linagliptin, when added to standard of care, did not increase \nthe risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (table 5) as compared to glimepiride.

Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed:\n\n• a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034,\n\n• a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017,\n\n\n\n17\n\n• a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin \n13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and \nversus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-\nyears (p=0.021),\n\n• a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin \n11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nJentadueto in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nBioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that the Jentadueto (linagliptin/metformin\nhydrochloride) combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of linagliptin and metformin \nhydrochloride as individual tablets.\n\nAdministration of Jentadueto 2.5/1,000 mg with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of \nlinagliptin. With metformin there was no change in AUC, however mean peak serum concentration of \nmetformin was decreased by 18% when administered with food. A delayed time to peak serum \nconcentrations by 2 hours was observed for metformin under fed conditions. These changes are not \nlikely to be clinically meaningful.\n\nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nJentadueto.\n\nLinagliptin\nThe pharmacokinetics of linagliptin has been extensively characterised in healthy subjects and patients \nwith type 2 diabetes. After oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteers or patients, \nlinagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours \npost-dose.\n\nPlasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life \n(terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours), that is mostly related to the saturable, tight \nbinding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the active substance. \nThe effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of \nmultiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is approximately 12 hours. After once daily dosing of 5 mg \nlinagliptin, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached by the third dose. Plasma AUC of \nlinagliptin increased approximately 33% following 5 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first \ndose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small \n(12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Due to the concentration dependent binding of linagliptin to DPP-\nIV, the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on total exposure is not linear; indeed total plasma AUC \nof linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, while unbound AUC increases in a \nroughly dose-proportional manner. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin was generally similar in \nhealthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nAbsorption\nThe absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Co-administration of a high-fat meal \nwith linagliptin prolonged the time to reach Cmax by 2 hours and lowered Cmax by 15%, but no \ninfluence on AUC 0-72h was observed. No clinically relevant effect of Cmax and Tmax changes is \nexpected; therefore linagliptin may be administered with or without food. \n\n\n\n18\n\nDistribution\nAs a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state following a \nsingle 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 litres, indicating \nthat linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is \nconcentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/l to 75-89% at ≥ 30 nmol/l, reflecting \nsaturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin At high concentrations, \nwhere DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70-80% of linagliptin was bound to other plasma proteins than DPP-4, \nhence 20-30% were unbound in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation\nFollowing a [14C] linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, approximately 5% of the radioactivity was excreted in \nurine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with \na relative exposure of 13.3% of linagliptin at steady-state was detected which was found to be \npharmacologically inactive, and thus does not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of \nlinagliptin.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of \nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. \nRenal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 ml/min.\n\nRenal impairment\nUnder steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was \ncomparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of \nabout 1.7 fold was observed compared with control. Exposure in T2DM patients with severe RI was \nincreased by about 1.4 fold compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function. Steady-state \npredictions for AUC of linagliptin in patients with ESRD indicated comparable exposure to that of \npatients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In addition, linagliptin is not expected to be \neliminated to a therapeutically significant degree by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. No dose \nadjustment of linagliptin is recommended in patients with renal impairment; therefore, linagliptin may \nbe continued as a single entity tablet at the same total daily dose of 5 mg if Jentadueto is discontinued \ndue to evidence of renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild moderate and severe hepatic impairment (according to the Child-Pugh \nclassification), mean AUC and Cmax of linagliptin were similar to healthy matched controls following \nadministration of multiple 5 mg doses of linagliptin. \n\nBody Mass Index (BMI)\nBody mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data. The clinical trials before marketing \nauthorization have been performed up to a BMI equal to 40 kg/m2.\n\nGender\nGender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data. \n\nElderly\nAge did not have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data. Older subjects (65 to 80 years, \noldest patient was 78 years) had comparable plasma concentrations of linagliptin compared to younger \nsubjects. Linagliptin trough concentrations were also measured in elderly (age ≥ 70 years) with type 2 \ndiabetes in a phase III study of 24 weeks duration. Linagliptin concentrations in this study were within \nthe range of values previously observed in younger type 2 diabetes patients.\n\n\n\n19\n\nPaediatric population\nA paediatric Phase 2 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg and 5 mg \nlinagliptin in children and adolescents ≥10 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nobserved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those found in adult \nsubjects. Linagliptin 5 mg showed superiority over 1 mg with regard to trough DPP-4 inhibition (72% \nvs 32%, p=0.0050) and a numerically larger reduction with regard to adjusted mean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c (-0.63% vs -0.48%, n.s.). Due to the limited nature of the data set the results should \nbe interpreted cautiously.\n\nRace\nRace had no obvious effect on the plasma concentrations of linagliptin based on a composite analysis \nof available pharmacokinetic data, including patients of Caucasian, Hispanic, African, and Asian \norigin. In addition the pharmacokinetic characteristics of linagliptin were found to be similar in \ndedicated phase I studies in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian healthy subjects and African American \ntype 2 diabetes patients. \n\nMetformin\nAbsorption\nAfter an oral dose of metformin, Tmax is reached in 2.5 hours. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg or \n850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral \ndose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%.\n\nAfter oral administration, metformin hydrochloride absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is \nassumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride absorption are non-linear.\n\nAt the recommended metformin hydrochloride doses and dosing schedules, steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 microgram/ml. In \ncontrolled clinical trials, maximum metformin hydrochloride plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n5 microgram/ml, even at maximum doses.\n\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin hydrochloride. Following \nadministration of a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC \n(area under the curve) and a 35 minute prolongation of the time to peak plasma concentration were \nobserved. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. \n\nDistribution\nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin hydrochloride partitions into erythrocytes. The blood \npeak is lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells \nmost likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) \nranged between 63-276 l. \n\nBiotransformation\nMetformin hydrochloride is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in \nhumans. \n\nElimination\nRenal clearance of metformin hydrochloride is > 400 ml/min, indicating that metformin hydrochloride \nis eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent \nterminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 hours. \nWhen renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and \nthus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin hydrochloride in \nplasma.\n\nPaediatric population\nSingle dose study: after single doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 mg, paediatric patients have \nshown a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that observed in healthy adults. \n\n\n\n20\n\nMultiple-dose study: data are restricted to one study. After repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 7 \ndays in paediatric patients the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were \nreduced by approximately 33% and 40%, respectively compared to diabetic adults who received \nrepeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 14 days. As the dose is individually titrated based on \nglycaemic control, this is of limited clinical relevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nLinagliptin plus metformin\nGeneral toxicity studies in rats for up to 13 weeks were performed with the co-administration of \nlinagliptin and metformin. The only observed interaction between linagliptin and metformin was a \nreduction of body weight gain. No other additive toxicity caused by the combination of linagliptin and \nmetformin was observed at AUC exposure levels up to 2 and 23 times human exposure, respectively.\n\nAn embryofetal development study in pregnant rats did not indicate a teratogenic effect attributed to \nthe co-administration of linagliptin and metformin at AUC exposure levels up to 4 and 30 times \nhuman exposure, respectively.\n\nLinagliptin\nLiver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the principal target organs of toxicity in mice and rats at \nrepeat doses of linagliptin of more than 300 times the human exposure.\nIn rats, effects on reproductive organs, thyroid and the lymphoid organs were seen at more than \n1500 times human exposure. Strong pseudo-allergic reactions were observed in dogs at medium doses, \nsecondarily causing cardiovascular changes, which were considered dog-specific. Liver, kidneys, \nstomach, reproductive organs, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes were target organs of toxicity in \nCynomolgus monkeys at more than 450 times human exposure. At more than 100 times human \nexposure, irritation of the stomach was the major finding in these monkeys.\n\nLinagliptin and its main metabolite did not show a genotoxic potential.\nOral 2 year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or \nmale mice. A significantly higher incidence of malignant lymphomas only in female mice at the \nhighest dose (> 200 times human exposure) is not considered relevant for humans (explanation: non-\ntreatment related but due to highly variable background incidence). Based on these studies there is no \nconcern for carcinogenicity in humans.\n\nThe NOAEL for fertility, early embryonic development and teratogenicity in rats was set at \n> 900 times the human exposure. The NOAEL for maternal-, embryo-fetal-, and offspring toxicity in \nrats was 49 times human exposure. No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits at > 1,000 times \nhuman exposure. A NOAEL of 78 times human exposure was derived for embryo-fetal toxicity in \nrabbits, and for maternal toxicity the NOAEL was 2.1 times human exposure. Therefore, it is \nconsidered unlikely that linagliptin affects reproduction at therapeutic exposures in humans.\n\nMetformin\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What Jentadueto is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Jentadueto\n3. How to take Jentadueto\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Jentadueto\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Jentadueto is and what it is used for\n\nThe name of your tablet is Jentadueto. It contains two different active substances linagliptin and \nmetformin.\n- Linagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 \n\ninhibitors).\n- Metformin belongs to a class of medicines called biguanides.\n\nHow Jentadueto works\nThe two active substances work together to control blood sugar levels in adult patients with a form of \ndiabetes called ‘type 2 diabetes mellitus’. Along with diet and exercise, this medicine helps to improve \nthe levels and effects of insulin after a meal and lowers the amount of sugar made by your body.\n\nThis medicine can be used alone or with certain other medicines for diabetes like sulphonylureas, \nempagliflozin, or insulin.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\n\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems \nlike heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Jentadueto\n\nDo not take Jentadueto\n- if you are allergic to linagliptin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine\n\n(listed in section 6).\n- if you have severely reduced kidney function.\n\n\n\n50\n\nif you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic \nacidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ‘ketone \nbodies’ accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell.\n\n- if you ever had a diabetic pre-coma.\n- if you have a severe infection such as an infection affecting your lung or bronchial system or \n\nyour kidney. Severe infections may lead to kidney problems, which can put you at risk for lactic \nacidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions').\n\n- if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration), e.g. due to long-lasting or severe \ndiarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row. Dehydration may lead to kidney \nproblems, which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions').\n\n- if you are treated for acute heart failure or have recently had a heart attack, have severe \nproblems with your circulation (such as shock) or have breathing difficulties. This may lead to a \nlack in oxygen supply to tissue which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and \nprecautions').\n\n- if you have liver problems.\n- if you drink alcohol to excess, either every day or only from time to time (see section \n\n'Jentadueto with alcohol').\n\nDo not take Jentadueto if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or\npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Jentadueto\n- if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin). Jentadueto should not be \n\nused to treat this condition.\n- if you are taking insulin or an anti-diabetic medicine known as ‘sulphonylurea’, your doctor may \n\nwant to reduce your dose of insulin or sulphonylurea when you take either of them together with \nJentadueto in order to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).\n\n- if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.\n\nIf you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe abdominal pain, you should consult\nyour doctor.\n\nIf you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. \nYour doctor may ask you to stop Jentadueto.\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking Jentadueto.\n\nDiabetic skin problems are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the \nrecommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.\n\nRisk of lactic acidosis.\nDue to the metformin component, Jentadueto may cause a very rare, but very serious complication \ncalled lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing \nlactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or \nalcohol intake, dehydration(see further information below), liver problems and any medical conditions \nin which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).\nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Jentadueto for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instruction.\n\n\n\n51\n\nStop taking Jentadueto and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you \nexperience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.\nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include:\n- vomiting\n- stomach ache (abdominal pain)\n- muscle cramps\n- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness\n- difficulty in breathing\n- reduced body temperature and heartbeat\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.\n\nIf you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Jentadueto during and for some time after the \nprocedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nJentadueto.\n\nDuring treatment with Jentadueto, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or\nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Jentadueto\nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Jentadueto before or at the time of \nthe injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nJentadueto.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may \nneed more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the \ndosage of Jentadueto. It is especially important to mention the following:\n- medicines which increase urine production (diuretics)\n- medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen \n\nand celecoxib)\n- certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists)\n- medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have reduced \n\nkidney function (such as verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, \ntrimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib, olaparib).\n\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or chronic \npain.\n\n- rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.\n- medicines used to treat diseases that involve inflammation, like asthma and arthritis\n\n(corticosteroids).\n- bronchodilators (β-sympathomimetics) for the treatment of bronchial asthma.\n- alcohol-containing medicines.\n\nJentadueto with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Jentadueto since this may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis (see section ‘Warnings and precautions’).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should not use Jentadueto if you are pregnant. It is unknown if this medicine is harmful to the \nunborn child.\n\n\n\n52\n\nMetformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It is not known whether linagliptin passes into\nhuman milk. Talk to your doctor if you want to breast-feed while taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nJentadueto has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nHowever, taking Jentadueto in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can \ncause too low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use \nmachines or work without safe foothold.\n\n3. How to take Jentadueto\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\nThe amount of Jentadueto that you will take varies depending on your condition and the doses you \ncurrently take of metformin and/or individual tablets of linagliptin and metformin. Your doctor will \ntell you exactly the dose of this medicine to take.\n\nHow to take this medicine\n- one tablet twice daily by mouth in the dose prescribed by your doctor.\n- with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.\n\nYou should not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of 5 mg linagliptin and 2,000 mg \nmetformin hydrochloride.\n\nContinue to take Jentadueto as long as your doctor prescribes it so you can continue to help control \nyour blood sugar. Your doctor may prescribe this medicine together with another oral anti-diabetic \nmedicine or insulin. Remember to take all medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best \nresults for your health.\n\nYou should continue your diet during treatment with Jentadueto and take care that your carbohydrate\nintake is equally distributed over the day. If you are overweight, continue your energy-restricted diet \nas instructed. This medicine alone is unlikely to cause abnormally low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). \nWhen Jentadueto is used with a sulphonylurea medicine or with insulin, low blood sugar can occur \nand your doctor may reduce the dose of your sulphonylurea or insulin.\n\nIf you take more Jentadueto than you should\nIf you take more Jentadueto tablets than you should have, you may experience lactic acidosis. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific such as feeling or being very sick, vomiting, stomach \nache with muscle cramps, a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness, and difficulty in \nbreathing. Further symptoms are reduced body temperature and heartbeat. If this happens to you, you \nmay need immediate hospital treatment, as lactic acidosis can lead to coma. Stop taking this \nmedicine immediately and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away (see section 2). \nTake the medicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take Jentadueto\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is nearly time for the \nnext dose, skip the missed dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Never take \ntwo doses at the same time (morning or evening).\n\nIf you stop taking Jentadueto\nKeep taking Jentadueto until your doctor tells you to stop. This is to help keep your blood sugar under \ncontrol. \n\n\n\n53\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSome symptoms need immediate medical attention\nYou should stop taking Jentadueto and see your doctor straight away if you experience the following \nsymptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia): trembling, sweating, anxiety, blurred vision, tingling \nlips, paleness, mood change, or confusion. Hypoglycaemia (frequency very common (may affect more \nthan 1 in 10 people)) is an identified side effect for the combination of Jentadueto plus sulphonylurea\nand for the combination Jentadueto plus insulin.\n\nJentadueto may cause a very rare (may affect up to 1 user in 10,000), but very serious side effect \ncalled lactic acidosis (see section ‘Warnings and precautions’). If this happens you must stop taking \nJentadueto and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately, as lactic acidosis may lead to \ncoma.\n\nSome patients have experienced inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis; frequency rare, may affect \nup to 1 in 1000 people). \nSTOP taking Jentadueto and contact a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following serious \nside effects:\n- Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your \n\nback, as well as nausea and vomiting, as it could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas \n(pancreatitis).\n\nOther side effects of Jentadueto include:\nSome patients have experienced allergic reactions (frequency rare), which may be serious, including \nwheezing and shortness of breath (bronchial hyperreactivity; frequency uncommon (may affect up to 1 \nin 100 people)). Some patients experienced rash (frequency uncommon), hives (urticaria; frequency \nrare), and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or \nswallowing (angioedema; frequency rare). If you experience any of the signs of illness mentioned \nabove, stop taking Jentadueto and call your doctor right away. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine \nto treat your allergic reaction and a different medicine for your diabetes.\n\nSome patients have had the following side effects while taking Jentadueto:\n- Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea, blood enzyme increase (lipase increase), \n\nfeeling sick (nausea)\n- Uncommon: inflamed nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), cough, loss of appetite (decreased \n\nappetite), being sick (vomiting), blood enzyme increase (amylase increase), itching (pruritus)\n- Rare: blistering of skin (bullous pemphigoid)\n\nSome patients have experienced the following side effects while taking Jentadueto with insulin\n- Uncommon: liver function disorders, constipation\n\nSide effects when taking metformin alone, that were not described for Jentadueto:\n- Very common: abdominal pain.\n- Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): a metallic taste (taste disturbance).\n- Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): decreased vitamin B12 levels, hepatitis (a problem \n\nwith your liver), skin reaction as redness of the skin (erythema).\n\n\n\n54\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.
