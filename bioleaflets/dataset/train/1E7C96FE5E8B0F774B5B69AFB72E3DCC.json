NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nIntronA 3 million IU/0.5 mL solution for injection or infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne vial of solution for injection or infusion contains 3 million IU of recombinant interferon alfa-2b\nproduced in E. coli by recombinant DNA technology, in 0.5 mL of solution.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection or infusion.\nClear and colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nTreatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral \nreplication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or \nfibrosis.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nBefore initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical \ntrials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1).\n\nAdult patients\nIntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA \n(HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4).\n\nThe best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents\nIntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. \n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nTreatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nMonotherapy \nTreatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nClinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is \nobtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by < 34 % Ph+ \nleukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is \uf0b3 34 %, but < 90 % Ph+ cells in the \nmarrow.\n\nCombination therapy \nThe combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months \nof treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses \nand to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b \nmonotherapy.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nAs maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction \nin myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.\nCurrent clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the \nplateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nTreatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction \nchemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of \nthe following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each > 3 cm), \nsystemic symptoms (weight loss > 10 %, pyrexia > 38\u00b0C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), \nsplenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or \nepidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nTreatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\".\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic \nrecurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease.\n\nNot all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and \nstrength must be selected.\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the \ndose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent \nintolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment \nwith IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for \nmaintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nThe recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a \nweek (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.\n\nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders \n(white blood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment \nshould be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) \nor severe thrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3).\n\nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment \n(at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nAdults\nIntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) \nto adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination \nwith ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food \n(morning and evening). \n\n(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for \ncombination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see \nribavirin oral solution SPC.)\n\nRelapse patients (adults)\nIntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are \navailable for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin for 6 months.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (adults)\nThe efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.\n\n- IntronA in combination with ribavirin\nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months.\n\nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who\nexhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment \nsample) and high pre-treatment viral load.\n\nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment \n(HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment).\n\n- IntronA alone\nThe optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of \nbetween 12 and 18 months is advised.\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (children and adolescents)\nThe efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and \nadolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C. \n\nDuration of treatment for children and adolescents\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve \n\nvirological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders \n(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent \npatients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 \nHCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA \nat treatment week 24.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nThe recommended dose is 2 million IU/m2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every \nother day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell \nleukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of \nIntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet \ncount and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained \nunless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nThe recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some \npatients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously \nin association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per \nmonth (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, \nadminister the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m2 daily) to maintain \nhaematological remission.\n\nIntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial \nhaematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nMaintenance therapy\nIn patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following \ninitial induction chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, \nsubcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m2 three times a week (every other day).\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nAdjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of \n5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens \nare advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone).\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nThe usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week \n(every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The \ntreatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long \nas the patient responds to interferon alfa-2b treatment.\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs induction therapy, interferon alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of 20 million IU/m2\n\ndaily for five days a week for a four-week period; the calculated interferon alfa-2b dose is added to \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see \nsection 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m2 administered \nsubcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.\n\nIf severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes \ndecrease to < 500/mm3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to \n> 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. \nInterferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after \ndose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to < 250/mm3 or ALT/AST rises to > 10 x upper limit of\nnormal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.\n\nAlthough the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at \nthe recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.\n\nIntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders. \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).\n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.\n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with \n\nimmunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.\n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant \n\nrecipients.\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment.\n- Combination of IntronA with telbivudine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \nobserved in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly \nduring the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult \npatients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes \ndirected against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of \nmental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of \nthese undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and \nthe patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:\nIf treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised \ndiagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe \n\npsychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse:\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\nChildren and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)\nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to \n48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy \nwith standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile \ndecrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off \ntreatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and \ndemonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of \ntreatment.\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted \n\nin reduced final adult height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence\n\nof disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to \ninterferon alfa-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, \ndiscontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate \ninterruption of treatment.\n\nAdverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities\nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in \nsome cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and \ndeath in patients with cirrhosis.\nDiscontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition.\nAny patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored \nclosely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress.\nLiver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nHypotension\nHypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require \nsupportive treatment.\n\nNeed for adequate hydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\nPatients with debilitating medical conditions\nIntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nto ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., \nthrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.\n\nPulmonary conditions\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any \npatient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray \ntaken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function \nimpairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. \nWhile this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon \nalpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. \nPrompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to \nbe associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nOcular adverse events\nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous \nretinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after \ntreatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms \nduring treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual \nexaminations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may \nbe associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA \nshould be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nObtundation, coma and encephalopathy\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in \nsome patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a \nfew patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high \ndoses of IntronA.\n\nPatients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is \nrecommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced \nstages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac \narrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require \ndiscontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac \ndisease.\n\nHypertriglyceridemia\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nPatients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nIntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\nKidney and liver graft rejection\nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of \nkidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.\n\nAuto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nConcomitant chemotherapy \nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered \nmedicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events \ninclude mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of \nthe risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the \nconcomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the \nfrequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases \n(i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nMonotherapy\nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, \n2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by \nconventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid \nstatus is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, \nevaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that \ntime must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can \nbe maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of \nIntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid \ndysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for \nchildren and adolescents).\n\nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents\nApproximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy \ndeveloped increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease \nbelow the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated \nand any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA \ntherapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid \ndysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid \nabnormalities are detected, the patient\u2019s thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically \nappropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid \ndysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\nHCV/HIV Coinfection\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at \nincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to \n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nHAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy \nand zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin \nmay increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nLaboratory Tests \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be \nconducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA.\n\nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, \nand every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to \ngreater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and \nsymptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be \nmonitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin.\n\nIn patients treated for malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and \ndifferential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the \nmaintenance phase of therapy.\n\nEffect on fertility\nInterferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of IntronA \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL, i.e., essentially \n\"sodium-free\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nIntronA.\n\nInteractions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution \nmust be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant \ntherapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives \n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\ntheophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline \nlevels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.\n\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).\n\nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration) (see section 4.4).\n\nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased \nserum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human \nleukocyte interferon.\n\nIntronA must be used with caution in fertile men.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female \npartners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SPC).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA \nis to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior \nto initiation of treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment \nwith IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from \n6 MIU/m2/week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly \nreported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were \noften reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment.\n\nAdults\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three \ntimes a week. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is \npresented from clinical trials in na\u00efve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to \nmoderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and \npost-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \nfrequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10);\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rarely (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not known. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing

alone.\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n#Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThese undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone.\n\nThe undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is \nadministered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For \nexample, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of \nfatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flu-\nlike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C \ntrials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of \npatients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower \ndoses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment. \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha \ninterferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\naggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).\n\nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than \n10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in \nhaemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and \nserum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase \nin serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp.\n\nChildren and adolescent population \nChronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due \nto adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent \npopulation studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specific \nconcern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of \n9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during \ntreatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of \n44th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean \nbaseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height \npercentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from \nthe start of treatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was \navailable for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 \npercentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks \nwith IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height \nin some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-\nterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropaenia.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and \nadolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings \nof frequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions very commonly and commonly reported during clinical trials in\nchildren and adolescent patients treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions\nInfection and infestations\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nViral infection, pharyngitis\nFungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, otitis \nmedia, tooth abscess, herpes simplex, urinary tract infection, \nvaginitis, gastroenteritis\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps)\nCommon: Neoplasm (unspecified)\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnaemia, neutropaenia\nThrombocytopaenia, lymphadenopathy\n\nEndocrine disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHypothyroidism\u00a7, \nHyperthyroidism\u00a7, virilism\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnorexia\nHypertriglyceridemia\u00a7, hyperuricemia, increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDepression, emotional lability, insomnia\nSuicidal ideation, aggressive reaction, confusion, behaviour \ndisorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, nervousness, sleep \ndisorder, abnormal dreaming, apathy\n\nNervous system disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHeadache, dizziness\nHyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, hypoaesthesia, \nhyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, somnolence\n\nEye disorders\nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland disorder\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Flushing, pallor\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, nasal \n\nirritation, rhinorrhea, sneezing\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain\nMouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, right upper \nquadrant pain, dyspepsia, glossitis, gastroesophageal reflux, rectal \ndisorder, gastrointestinal disorder, constipation, loose stools, \ntoothache, tooth disorder\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAlopecia, rash\nPhotosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, eczema, acne, skin \ndisorder, nail disorder, skin discolouration, pruritus, dry skin, \nerythema, bruise, sweating increased\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, vaginal \n\ndisorder\nMale: testicular pain\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\nVery common:\n\nCommon:\n\nInjection site inflammation, injection site reaction, fatigue, rigors, \npyrexia\u00a7, influenza-like symptoms\u00a7, malaise, irritability\nChest pain, asthenia, oedema, injection site pain\n\nInvestigations\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\u00a7\n\nInjury and poisoning\nCommon: Skin laceration\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for \nany pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital \nsigns and close observation of the patient is indicated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05\n\nIntronA is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant \nDNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically \nengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.\n\nThe activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b \nprotein corresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity \nof the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of \nhuman leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately \n15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or \nvarious synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: \nalpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain \nseveral different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha \ninterferons have been identified. IntronA has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b.\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain \nmonkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure \nto human type 1 interferons.\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a \ncomplex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18\n\nthat this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, \nincluding inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and \nsuch immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and \naugmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities \nmay contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both \nanimal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has \ndemonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates \nthat therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been \nobserved. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity \nand mortality has been observed.\n\nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic \nactive hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover \nchildren treated with interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of \ndepression were observed.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response \nrate is 47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon \nwith ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in na\u00efve patients with a \nribavirin dose > 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01).\n\nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical \ntrials in 2,552 interferon-na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nIntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic \nresponse, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/mL), a liver \nbiopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nIntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were \nfollowed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained \nvirologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3.\n\nCo-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C in na\u00efve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are \nprognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the \ncombination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The \nrelative benefit of combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most \ndifficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3).\n\nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who \nreceived IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received \uf0b3 80 % of their treatment had a higher \nsustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment \n(56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with IntronA + ribavirin (one year of treatment) by \ngenotype and viral load\n\nHCV Genotype I\nN=503\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC/I98-580\n\nAll Genotypes 16 % 41 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 9 % 29 % 33 %\n\nGenotype 1 \n\uf0a3 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n25 % 33 % 45 %\n\nGenotype 1\n> 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n3 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 31 % 65 % 79 %\n\nI IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week)\nI/R IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day)\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, \npatients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received \npegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is \npresented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which \nenrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with \nHIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) plus \nribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled \n95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. \nPatients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 \u00b5g /week based on \nweight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin \n(800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.\n\nRelapse patients \nA total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA \nmonotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA \nincreased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV \n(< 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was \nsustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment.\n\nLong-Term efficacy data\nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b or non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic \nresponse and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients \ncompleted at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of \n492 relapsed during this study. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with \na 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients \nwith cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nChronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population\nThree clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and \nribavirin and one with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin \nwere less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day \n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nfor 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % \nmale, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly \nconsisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained \nvirological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack \nof data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the \npotential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nStudy results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents\n\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n+\n\nribavirin 15 mg/kg/day\n\nOverall Responsea (n=118) 54 (46 %)*\n\nGenotype 1 (n=92) 33 (36 %)*\n\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n=26) 21 (81 %)*\n\n*Number (%) of patients\naDefined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-\nup period\n\nLong-term efficacy data \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nResults from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin\nIn a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic \nhepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 \uf06dg/m2 plus ribavirin \n15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and \n63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs \nsection 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nTable 6 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects\n\nn = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\n\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\n\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\n\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\n\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \n\ndetection=125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\n\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m2\n\nand 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly \nand as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following \nsubcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the \nlower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon \ninjections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels \nwere below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and \nintramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %.\n\nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular \nadministration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The \nelimination half-life was approximately two hours.\n\nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of \nadministration.\n\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received \nIntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies \nwhich neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors \ndeveloping in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. \nThe detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of \nresponse or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was \nobserved apparently due to the low titres.\n\nChildren and adolescent population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7. The \npharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or \nadolescents.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nTable 7 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for IntronA and \nribavirincapsules when administered to children or adolescents with chronic hepatitis \nC\n\nParameter Ribavirin\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n\n(n = 17)\n\nIntronA\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for IntronA\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with \n20 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in \nmonkeys given 100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months.\n\nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been \nobserved (see section 4.4).\n\nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic \nin rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in \noffspring of treated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca \nmulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose \nof 2 million IU/m2. Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and \n30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups \n(corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of \n2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-\nrelated anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus monkeys.\n\nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events.\n\nIntronA plus ribavirin\nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon \nalfa-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results \nhave demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with \nribavirin (see section 5.3 of Rebetol SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with \nribavirin).\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection or infusion.\nClear and colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nTreatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral \nreplication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or \nfibrosis.\n\nChronic hepatitis C \nBefore initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical \ntrials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1).\n\nAdult patients \nIntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA \n(HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4).\n\nThe best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents\nIntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. \n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nTreatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nMonotherapy \nTreatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia.\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nClinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is \nobtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by < 34 % Ph+ \nleukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is \uf0b3 34 %, but < 90 % Ph+ cells in the \nmarrow.\n\nCombination therapy \nThe combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months \nof treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses \nand to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b \nmonotherapy.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nAs maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction \nin myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.\nCurrent clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the \nplateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nTreatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction \nchemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of \nthe following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each > 3 cm), \nsystemic symptoms (weight loss > 10 %, pyrexia > 38\u00b0C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), \nsplenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or \nepidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nTreatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\".\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic \nrecurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease.\n\nNot all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and \nstrength must be selected.\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the \ndose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent \nintolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment \nwith IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for \nmaintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nThe recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a \nweek (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.\n\nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders \n(white blood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment \nshould be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) \nor severe thrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3).\n\nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment \n(at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nAdults\nIntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) \nto adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination \nwith ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food \n(morning and evening). \n\n(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for \ncombination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see \nribavirin oral solution SPC.)\n\nRelapse patients (adults)\nIntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are \navailable for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin for 6 months.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (adults)\nThe efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.\n\n- IntronA in combination with ribavirin\nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months.\n\nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who \nexhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment \nsample) and high pre-treatment viral load.\n\nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment \n(HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment).\n\n- IntronA alone\nThe optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of \nbetween 12 and 18 months is advised.\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point\nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (children and adolescents)\nThe efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and \nadolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C. \n\nDuration of treatment for children and adolescents\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve \n\nvirological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders \n(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent \npatients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 \nHCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA \nat treatment week 24.\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nThe recommended dose is 2 million IU/m2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every \nother day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell \nleukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of\nIntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet \ncount and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained \nunless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nThe recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some \npatients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously \nin association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per \nmonth (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, \nadminister the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m2 daily) to maintain \nhaematological remission.\n\nIntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial \nhaematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nMaintenance therapy \nIn patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following \ninitial induction chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, \nsubcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m2 three times a week (every other day).\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nAdjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of \n5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens \nare advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone).\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nThe usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week \n(every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The \ntreatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long \nas the patient responds to interferon alfa-2b treatment.\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs induction therapy, interferon alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of 20 million IU/m2\n\ndaily for five days a week for a four-week period; the calculated interferon alfa-2b dose is added to \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see \nsection 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m2 administered \nsubcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.\n\nIf severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes \ndecrease to < 500/mm3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to \n> 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. \nInterferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after \ndose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to < 250/mm3 or ALT/AST rises to > 10 x upper limit of \nnormal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.\n\nAlthough the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at \nthe recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.\n\nIntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders. \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).\n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.\n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with \n\nimmunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.\n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant \n\nrecipients.\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment.\n- Combination of IntronA with telbivudine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \nobserved in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly \nduring the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult \npatients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes \ndirected against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of \nmental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of \nthese undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and \nthe patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:\nIf treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised \ndiagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe \n\npsychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse:\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\nChildren and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)\nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to \n48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy \nwith standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile \ndecrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off \ntreatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and \ndemonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of \ntreatment.\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted \n\nin reduced final adult height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence\n\nof disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to \ninterferon alfa-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, \ndiscontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate \ninterruption of treatment.\n\nAdverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities\nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in \nsome cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and \ndeath in patients with cirrhosis.\nDiscontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition.\nAny patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored \nclosely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress.\nLiver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nHypotension\nHypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require \nsupportive treatment.\n\nNeed for adequate hydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\nPatients with debilitating medical conditions\nIntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone \n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nto ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., \nthrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.\n\nPulmonary conditions\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any \npatient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray \ntaken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function \nimpairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. \nWhile this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon \nalpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. \nPrompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to \nbe associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nOcular adverse events\nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous \nretinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after \ntreatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms \nduring treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual \nexaminations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may \nbe associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA \nshould be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nObtundation, coma and encephalopathy\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in \nsome patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a \nfew patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high \ndoses of IntronA.\n\nPatients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is \nrecommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced \nstages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac \narrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require \ndiscontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac \ndisease.\n\nHypertriglyceridemia\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nPatients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nIntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\nKidney and liver graft rejection\nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of \nkidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.\n\nAuto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nConcomitant chemotherapy \nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered \nmedicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events \ninclude mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of \nthe risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the \nconcomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the \nfrequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases \n(i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nMonotherapy \nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, \n2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by \nconventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid \nstatus is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, \nevaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that \ntime must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can \nbe maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of \nIntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid \ndysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for \nchildren and adolescents).\n\nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents\nApproximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy \ndeveloped increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease \nbelow the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated \nand any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA \ntherapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid \ndysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid \nabnormalities are detected, the patient\u2019s thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically \nappropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid \ndysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\nHCV/HIV Coinfection\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at \nincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to \n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\nHAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy \nand zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin \nmay increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nLaboratory Tests \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be \nconducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA.\n\nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, \nand every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to \ngreater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and \nsymptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be \nmonitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin.\n\nIn patients treated for malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and \ndifferential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the \nmaintenance phase of therapy.\n\nEffect on fertility\nInterferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of IntronA \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL, i.e., essentially \n\"sodium-free\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nIntronA.\n\nInteractions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution \nmust be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant \ntherapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives \n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\ntheophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline \nlevels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.\n\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).\n\nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration) (see section 4.4).\n\nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased \nserum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human \nleukocyte interferon.\n\nIntronA must be used with caution in fertile men.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female \npartners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SPC).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA \nis to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior \nto initiation of treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment \nwith IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n \n\n\n\n36\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from \n6 MIU/m2/week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly \nreported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were \noften reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment.\n\nAdults\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three \ntimes a week. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is \npresented from clinical trials in na\u00efve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to \nmoderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and \npost-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \nfrequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10);\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rarely (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not known. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse

alone.\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n#Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThese undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone.\n\nThe undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is \nadministered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For \nexample, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of \nfatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flu-\nlike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C \ntrials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of \npatients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower \ndoses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment. \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha \ninterferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or \n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\naggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).\n\nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than \n10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in \nhaemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and \nserum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase \nin serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp.\n\nChildren and adolescent population \nChronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due \nto adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent \npopulation studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specific \nconcern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of \n9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during \ntreatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of \n44th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean \nbaseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height \npercentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from \nthe start of treatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was \navailable for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 \npercentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks \nwith IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height \nin some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-\nterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropaenia.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and \nadolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings \nof frequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for \nany pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital \nsigns and close observation of the patient is indicated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05\n\nIntronA is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant \nDNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically \nengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.\n\nThe activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b \nprotein corresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity \nof the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of \nhuman leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately \n15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or \nvarious synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: \nalpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain \nseveral different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha \ninterferons have been identified. IntronA has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b.\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain \nmonkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure \nto human type 1 interferons.\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a \ncomplex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n42\n\nthat this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, \nincluding inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and \nsuch immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and \naugmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities \nmay contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both \nanimal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has \ndemonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates \nthat therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been \nobserved. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity \nand mortality has been observed.\n\nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic \nactive hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover \nchildren treated with interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of \ndepression were observed.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response \nrate is 47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon \nwith ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in na\u00efve patients with a \nribavirin dose > 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01).\n\nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical \ntrials in 2,552 interferon-na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nIntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic \nresponse, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/mL), a liver \nbiopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nIntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were \nfollowed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained \nvirologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3.\n\nCo-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C in na\u00efve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are \nprognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the \ncombination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The \nrelative benefit of combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most \ndifficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3).\n\nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who \nreceived IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received \uf0b3 80 % of their treatment had a higher \nsustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment \n(56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).\n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with IntronA + ribavirin (one year of treatment) by \ngenotype and viral load\n\nHCV Genotype I\nN=503\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC/I98-580\n\nAll Genotypes 16 % 41 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 9 % 29 % 33 %\n\nGenotype 1 \n\uf0a3 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n25 % 33 % 45 %\n\nGenotype 1\n> 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n3 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 31 % 65 % 79 %\n\nI IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week)\nI/R IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day)\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, \npatients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received \npegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is \npresented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which \nenrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with \nHIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) plus \nribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled \n95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. \nPatients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 \u00b5g /week based on \nweight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin \n(800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period \nof 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/mL \n(Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.\n\n \n\n\n\n44\n\nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after IntronA in combination with \nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients\n\nStudy 11 Study 22\n\npegylated \ninterferon alfa-\n2b  (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/\n\nweek) + \nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\nIntronA \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\np \nvaluea\n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor \n\n150c \u00b5g/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800-\n1,200 mg)d\n\nIntronA \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800-\n\n1,200 mg)d\np \n\nvalueb\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017\n\nGenotype 1, \n4\n\n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007\n\nGenotype 2, \n3\n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730\n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.\na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.\nb:  p value based on chi-square test.\nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 \u00b5g/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects \u2265 75 kg received 150 \u00b5g/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b.\nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.\n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.\n\nRelapse patients \nA total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA \nmonotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA \nincreased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV \n(< 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was \nsustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment.\n\nLong-Term efficacy data\nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b or non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic \nresponse and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients \ncompleted at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of \n492 relapsed during this study. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with \na 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients \nwith cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nChronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population\nThree clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and \nribavirin and one with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin \nwere less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day \n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\nfor 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % \nmale, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly \nconsisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained \nvirological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack \nof data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the \npotential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nStudy results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents\n\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n+\n\nribavirin 15 mg/kg/day\n\nOverall Responsea (n=118) 54 (46 %)*\n\nGenotype 1 (n=92) 33 (36 %)*\n\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n=26) 21 (81 %)*\n\n*Number (%) of patients\na Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period\n\nLong-term efficacy data \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nResults from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin\nIn a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic \nhepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 \uf06dg/m2 plus ribavirin \n15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and \n63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs \nsection 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nTable 6 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects\n\nn = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\n\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\n\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\n\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\n\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \n\ndetection=125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\n\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m2\n\nand 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly \nand as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following \nsubcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the \nlower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon \ninjections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels \nwere below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and \nintramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %.\n\nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular \nadministration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The \nelimination half-life was approximately two hours.\n\nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of \nadministration.\n\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received \nIntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies \nwhich neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors \ndeveloping in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. \nThe detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of \nresponse or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was \nobserved apparently due to the low titres.\n\nChildren and adolescent population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7. The \npharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or \nadolescents.\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nTable 7 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for IntronA and ribavirin \ncapsules when administered to children or adolescents with chronic hepatitis C\n\nParameter Ribavirin\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n\n(n = 17)\n\nIntronA\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for IntronA\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with \n20 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in \nmonkeys given 100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months.\n\nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been \nobserved (see section 4.4).\n\nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic \nin rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in \noffspring of treated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca \nmulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose \nof 2 million IU/m2. Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and\n30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups \n(corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of \n2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-\nrelated anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus monkeys.\n\nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events.\n\nIntronA plus ribavirin\nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon \nalfa-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results \nhave demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with \nribavirin (see section 5.3 of Rebetol SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with \nribavirin).\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nTreatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral \nreplication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or \nfibrosis.\n\nChronic hepatitis C \nBefore initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical \ntrials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1).\n\nAdult patients \nIntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA \n(HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4).\n\nThe best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents\nIntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. \n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nTreatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nMonotherapy \nTreatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia.\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nClinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is \nobtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by < 34 % Ph+ \nleukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is \uf0b3 34 %, but < 90 % Ph+ cells in the \nmarrow.\n\nCombination therapy \nThe combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months \nof treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses \nand to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b \nmonotherapy.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nAs maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction \nin myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.\nCurrent clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the \nplateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nTreatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction \nchemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of \nthe following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each > 3 cm), \nsystemic symptoms (weight loss > 10 %, pyrexia > 38\u00b0C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), \nsplenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or \nepidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nTreatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\".\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic \nrecurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease.\n\nNot all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and \nstrength must be selected.\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the \ndose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent \nintolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment \nwith IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for \nmaintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nThe recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a \nweek (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.\n\nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders \n(white blood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment \nshould be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) \nor severe thrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3).\n\nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment \n(at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nAdults\nIntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) \nto adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination \nwith ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food \n(morning and evening). \n\n(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for \ncombination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see \nribavirin oral solution SPC.)\n\nRelapse patients (adults)\nIntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are \navailable for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin for 6 months.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (adults)\nThe efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.\n\n- IntronA in combination with ribavirin\nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months.\n\nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who \nexhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment \nsample) and high pre-treatment viral load.\n\nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment \n(HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment).\n\n- IntronA alone\nThe optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of \nbetween 12 and 18 months is advised.\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (children and adolescents)\nThe efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and \nadolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C. \n\nDuration of treatment for children and adolescents\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve \n\nvirological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders \n(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent \npatients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 \nHCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA \nat treatment week 24.\n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nThe recommended dose is 2 million IU/m2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every \nother day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell \nleukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of \nIntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet \ncount and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained \nunless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nThe recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some \npatients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously \nin association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per \nmonth (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, \nadminister the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m2 daily) to maintain \nhaematological remission.\n\nIntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial \nhaematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nMaintenance therapy \nIn patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following \ninitial induction chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, \nsubcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m2 three times a week (every other day).\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nAdjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of \n5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens \nare advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone).\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nThe usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week \n(every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The \ntreatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long \nas the patient responds to interferon alfa-2b treatment.\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs induction therapy, interferon alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of 20 million IU/m2\n\ndaily for five days a week for a four-week period; the calculated interferon alfa-2b dose is added to \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see \nsection 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m2 administered \nsubcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.\n\nIf severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes \ndecrease to < 500/mm3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to \n> 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. \nInterferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after \ndose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to < 250/mm3 or ALT/AST rises to > 10 x upper limit of \nnormal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.\n\nAlthough the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at \nthe recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.\n\nIntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.\n\n \n\n\n\n54\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders. \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).\n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.\n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with \n\nimmunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.\n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant \n\nrecipients.\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment.\n- Combination of IntronA with telbivudine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \nobserved in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly \nduring the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult \npatients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes \ndirected against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of \nmental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of \nthese undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and \nthe patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:\nIf treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised \ndiagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe \n\npsychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse:\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \n\n \n\n\n\n55\n\ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\nChildren and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)\nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to \n48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy \nwith standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile \ndecrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off \ntreatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and \ndemonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of \ntreatment.\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted \n\nin reduced final adult height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence\n\nof disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to \ninterferon alfa-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, \ndiscontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate \ninterruption of treatment.\n\nAdverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities\nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in \nsome cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and \ndeath in patients with cirrhosis.\nDiscontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition.\nAny patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored \nclosely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress.\nLiver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nHypotension\nHypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require \nsupportive treatment.\n\nNeed for adequate hydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\nPatients with debilitating medical conditions\nIntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone \n\n \n\n\n\n56\n\nto ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., \nthrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.\n\nPulmonary conditions\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any \npatient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray \ntaken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function \nimpairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. \nWhile this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon \nalpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. \nPrompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to \nbe associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nOcular adverse events\nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous \nretinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after \ntreatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms \nduring treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual \nexaminations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may \nbe associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA \nshould be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nObtundation, coma and encephalopathy\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in \nsome patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a \nfew patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high \ndoses of IntronA.\n\nPatients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is \nrecommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced \nstages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac \narrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require \ndiscontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac \ndisease.\n\nHypertriglyceridemia\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nPatients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nIntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\nKidney and liver graft rejection\nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of \nkidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.\n\nAuto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \n\n \n\n\n\n57\n\nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nConcomitant chemotherapy \nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered \nmedicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events \ninclude mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of \nthe risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the \nconcomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the \nfrequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases \n(i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nMonotherapy \nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, \n2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by \nconventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid \nstatus is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, \nevaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that \ntime must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can \nbe maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of \nIntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid \ndysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for \nchildren and adolescents).\n\nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents\nApproximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy \ndeveloped increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease \nbelow the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated \nand any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA \ntherapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid \ndysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid \nabnormalities are detected, the patient\u2019s thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically \nappropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid \ndysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\nHCV/HIV Coinfection\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at \nincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to \n\n \n\n\n\n58\n\nHAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy \nand zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin \nmay increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nLaboratory Tests \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be \nconducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA.\n\nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, \nand every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to \ngreater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and \nsymptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be \nmonitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin.\n\nIn patients treated for malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and \ndifferential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the \nmaintenance phase of therapy.\n\nEffect on fertility\nInterferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of IntronA \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-\nfree\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nIntronA.\n\nInteractions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution \nmust be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant \ntherapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives \n\n \n\n\n\n59\n\ntheophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline \nlevels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.\n\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).\n\nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration) (see section 4.4).\n\nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased \nserum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human \nleukocyte interferon.\n\nIntronA must be used with caution in fertile men.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female \npartners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SPC).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA \nis to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior \nto initiation of treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment \nwith IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n \n\n\n\n60\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from \n6 MIU/m2/week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly \nreported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were \noften reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment.\n\nAdults\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three \ntimes a week. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is \npresented from clinical trials in na\u00efve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to \nmoderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and \npost-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \nfrequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10);\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rarely (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not known. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse

alone.\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n#Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThese undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone.\n\nThe undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is \nadministered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For \nexample, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of \nfatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flu-\nlike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C \ntrials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of \npatients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower \ndoses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment. \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha \ninterferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or \n\n \n\n\n\n63\n\naggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).\n\nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than \n10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in \nhaemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and \nserum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase \nin serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp.\n\nChildren and adolescent population \nChronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due \nto adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent \npopulation studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specific \nconcern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of \n9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during \ntreatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of \n44th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean \nbaseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height \npercentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from \nthe start of treatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was \navailable for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 \npercentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks \nwith IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height \nin some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-\nterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropaenia.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and \nadolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings \nof frequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions very commonly and commonly reported during clinical trials in\nchildren and adolescent patients treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions\nInfection and infestations\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nViral infection, pharyngitis\nFungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, otitis \nmedia, tooth abscess, herpes simplex, urinary tract infection, \nvaginitis, gastroenteritis\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps)\nCommon: Neoplasm (unspecified)\n\n \n\n\n\n64\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnaemia, neutropaenia\nThrombocytopaenia, lymphadenopathy\n\nEndocrine disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHypothyroidism\u00a7, \nHyperthyroidism\u00a7, virilism\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnorexia\nHypertriglyceridemia\u00a7, hyperuricemia, increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDepression, emotional lability, insomnia\nSuicidal ideation, aggressive reaction, confusion, behaviour \ndisorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, nervousness, sleep \ndisorder, abnormal dreaming, apathy\n\nNervous system disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHeadache, dizziness\nHyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, hypoaesthesia, \nhyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, somnolence\n\nEye disorders\nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland disorder\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Flushing, pallor\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, nasal \n\nirritation, rhinorrhea, sneezing\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain\nMouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, right upper \nquadrant pain, dyspepsia, glossitis, gastroesophageal reflux, rectal \ndisorder, gastrointestinal disorder, constipation, loose stools, \ntoothache, tooth disorder\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAlopecia, rash\nPhotosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, eczema, acne, skin \ndisorder, nail disorder, skin discolouration, pruritus, dry skin, \nerythema, bruise, sweating increased\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, vaginal \n\ndisorder\nMale: testicular pain\n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\nVery common:\n\nCommon:\n\nInjection site inflammation, injection site reaction, fatigue, rigors, \npyrexia\u00a7, influenza-like symptoms\u00a7, malaise, irritability\nChest pain, asthenia, oedema, injection site pain\n\nInvestigations\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\u00a7\n\nInjury and poisoning\nCommon: Skin laceration\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for \nany pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital \nsigns and close observation of the patient is indicated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05\n\nIntronA is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant \nDNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically \nengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.\n\nThe activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b \nprotein corresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity \nof the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of \nhuman leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately \n15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or \nvarious synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: \nalpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain \nseveral different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha \ninterferons have been identified. IntronA has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b.\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain \nmonkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure \nto human type 1 interferons.\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a \ncomplex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n66\n\nthat this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, \nincluding inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and \nsuch immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and \naugmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities \nmay contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both \nanimal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has \ndemonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates \nthat therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been \nobserved. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity \nand mortality has been observed.\n\nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic \nactive hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover \nchildren treated with interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of \ndepression were observed.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response \nrate is 47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon \nwith ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in na\u00efve patients with a \nribavirin dose > 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01).\n\nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical \ntrials in 2,552 interferon-na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nIntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic \nresponse, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/mL), a liver \nbiopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nIntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were \nfollowed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained \nvirologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with\nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3.\n\nCo-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C in na\u00efve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are \nprognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the \ncombination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The \nrelative benefit of combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most \ndifficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3).\n\nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who \nreceived IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received \uf0b3 80 % of their treatment had a higher \nsustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment \n(56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).\n\n \n\n\n\n67\n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with IntronA + ribavirin (one year of treatment) by \ngenotype and viral load\n\nHCV Genotype I\nN=503\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC/I98-580\n\nAll Genotypes 16 % 41 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 9 % 29 % 33 %\n\nGenotype 1 \n\uf0a3 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n25 % 33 % 45 %\n\nGenotype 1\n> 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n3 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 31 % 65 % 79 %\n\nI IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week)\nI/R IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day)\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, \npatients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received \npegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is \npresented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which \nenrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with \nHIV.

Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled \n95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. \nPatients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 \u00b5g /week based on \nweight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin \n(800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

JAMA 2004; 292(23): 2839-2848.\n2 Laguno M, Murillas J, Blanco J.L et al.  AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.\n\nRelapse patients \nA total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA \nmonotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA \nincreased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV \n(< 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was \nsustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment.\n\nLong-Term efficacy data\nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b or non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic \nresponse and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients \ncompleted at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of \n492 relapsed during this study. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with \na 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients \nwith cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nChronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population\nThree clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and \nribavirin and one with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin \nwere less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day \n\n \n\n\n\n69\n\nfor 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % \nmale, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly \nconsisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained \nvirological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack \nof data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the \npotential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nStudy results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents\n\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n+\n\nribavirin 15 mg/kg/day\n\nOverall Responsea (n=118) 54 (46 %)*\n\nGenotype 1 (n=92) 33 (36 %)*\n\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n=26) 21 (81 %)*\n\n*Number (%) of patients\na Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period\n\nLong-term efficacy data \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nResults from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin\nIn a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic \nhepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 \uf06dg/m2 plus ribavirin \n15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and \n63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs \nsection 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n \n\n\n\n70\n\nTable 6 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects\n\nn = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\n\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\n\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\n\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\n\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \n\ndetection=125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\n\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m2\n\nand 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly \nand as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following \nsubcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the \nlower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon \ninjections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels \nwere below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and \nintramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %.\n\nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular \nadministration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The \nelimination half-life was approximately two hours.\n\nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of \nadministration.\n\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received \nIntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies \nwhich neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors \ndeveloping in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. \nThe detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of \nresponse or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was \nobserved apparently due to the low titres.\n\nChildren and adolescent population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7. The \npharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or \nadolescents.\n\n \n\n\n\n71\n\nTable 7 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for IntronA and ribavirin \ncapsules when administered to children or adolescents with chronic hepatitis C\n\nParameter Ribavirin\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n\n(n = 17)\n\nIntronA\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for IntronA\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with \n20 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in \nmonkeys given 100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months.\n\nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been \nobserved (see section 4.4).\n\nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic \nin rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in \noffspring of treated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca \nmulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose \nof 2 million IU/m2. Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and \n30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups \n(corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of \n2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-\nrelated anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus monkeys.\n\nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events.\n\nIntronA plus ribavirin\nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon \nalfa-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results \nhave demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with \nribavirin (see section 5.3 of Rebetol SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with \nribavirin).\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nTreatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral \nreplication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or \nfibrosis.\n\nChronic hepatitis C \nBefore initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical \ntrials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1).\n\nAdult patients \nIntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA \n(HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4).\n\nThe best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents\nIntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. \n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nTreatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.\n\n \n\n\n\n75\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nMonotherapy \nTreatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia.\nClinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is \nobtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by < 34 % Ph+ \nleukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is \uf0b3 34 %, but < 90 % Ph+ cells in the \nmarrow.\n\nCombination therapy \nThe combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months \nof treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses \nand to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b \nmonotherapy.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nAs maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction \nin myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.\nCurrent clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the \nplateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nTreatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction \nchemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of \nthe following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each > 3 cm), \nsystemic symptoms (weight loss > 10 %, pyrexia > 38\u00b0C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), \nsplenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or \nepidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nTreatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\".\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic \nrecurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease.\n\nNot all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and \nstrength must be selected.\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the \ndose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent \nintolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment \nwith IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for \nmaintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nThe recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a \nweek (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.\n\nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders \n(white blood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment \nshould be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) \nor severe thrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3).\n\n \n\n\n\n76\n\nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment \n(at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nAdults\nIntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) \nto adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination \nwith ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food \n(morning and evening). \n\n(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for \ncombination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see \nribavirin oral solution SPC.)\n\nRelapse patients (adults)\nIntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are \navailable for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin for 6 months.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (adults)\nThe efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.\n\n- IntronA in combination with ribavirin\nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months.\n\nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who \nexhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment \nsample) and high pre-treatment viral load.\n\nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment \n(HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment).\n\n- IntronA alone\nThe optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of \nbetween 12 and 18 months is advised.\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (children and adolescents)\nThe efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and \nadolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C. \n\nDuration of treatment for children and adolescents\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve \n\nvirological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders \n\n \n\n\n\n77\n\n(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent \npatients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 \nHCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA \nat treatment week 24.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nThe recommended dose is 2 million IU/m2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every \nother day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell \nleukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of \nIntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet \ncount and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained \nunless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nThe recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some \npatients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously \nin association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per \nmonth (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, \nadminister the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m2 daily) to maintain \nhaematological remission.\n\nIntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial \nhaematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nMaintenance therapy \nIn patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following \ninitial induction chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, \nsubcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m2 three times a week (every other day).\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nAdjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of \n5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens \nare advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone).\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nThe usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week \n(every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The \ntreatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long \nas the patient responds to interferon alfa-2b treatment.\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs induction therapy, interferon alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of 20 million IU/m2\n\ndaily for five days a week for a four-week period; the calculated interferon alfa-2b dose is added to \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see \nsection 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m2 administered \nsubcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.\n\nIf severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes \ndecrease to < 500/mm3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to \n> 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. \nInterferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after \ndose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to < 250/mm3 or ALT/AST rises to > 10 x upper limit of \nnormal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\nAlthough the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at \nthe recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.\n\nIntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders. \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).\n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.\n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with \n\nimmunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.\n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant \n\nrecipients.\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment.\n- Combination of IntronA with telbivudine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \nobserved in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly \nduring the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult \npatients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes \ndirected against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of \nmental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of\nthese undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and \nthe patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:\nIf treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised \ndiagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe \n\npsychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse:\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \n\n \n\n\n\n79\n\nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\nChildren and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)\nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to \n48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy \nwith standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile \ndecrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off \ntreatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and \ndemonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of \ntreatment.\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted \n\nin reduced final adult height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence\n\nof disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to \ninterferon alfa-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, \ndiscontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate \ninterruption of treatment.\n\nAdverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities\nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in \nsome cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and \ndeath in patients with cirrhosis.\nDiscontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition.\nAny patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored \nclosely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress.\nLiver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nHypotension\nHypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require \nsupportive treatment.\n\nNeed for adequate hydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\n \n\n\n\n80\n\nPatients with debilitating medical conditions\nIntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone \nto ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., \nthrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.\n\nPulmonary conditions\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any \npatient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray \ntaken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function \nimpairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. \nWhile this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon \nalpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. \nPrompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to \nbe associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nOcular adverse events\nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous \nretinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after \ntreatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms \nduring treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual \nexaminations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may \nbe associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA \nshould be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nObtundation, coma and encephalopathy\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in \nsome patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a \nfew patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high \ndoses of IntronA.\n\nPatients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is \nrecommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced \nstages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac \narrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require \ndiscontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac \ndisease.\n\nHypertriglyceridemia\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nPatients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nIntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\nKidney and liver graft rejection\nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of \nkidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.\n\n \n\n\n\n81\n\nAuto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nConcomitant chemotherapy \nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered \nmedicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events \ninclude mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of \nthe risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the \nconcomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the \nfrequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases \n(i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nMonotherapy \nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, \n2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by \nconventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid \nstatus is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, \nevaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that \ntime must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can \nbe maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of \nIntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid \ndysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for \nchildren and adolescents).\n\nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents\nApproximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy \ndeveloped increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease \nbelow the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated \nand any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA \ntherapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid \ndysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid \nabnormalities are detected, the patient\u2019s thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically \nappropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid \ndysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\n \n\n\n\n82\n\nHCV/HIV Coinfection\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at \nincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to \nHAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy \nand zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin \nmay increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nLaboratory Tests \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be \nconducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA.\n\nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, \nand every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to \ngreater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and \nsymptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be \nmonitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin.\n\nIn patients treated for malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and \ndifferential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the \nmaintenance phase of therapy.\n\nEffect on fertility\nInterferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of IntronA \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 3 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-\nfree\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nIntronA.\n\n \n\n\n\n83\n\nInteractions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution \nmust be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant \ntherapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives \ntheophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline \nlevels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.\n\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).\n\nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration) (see section 4.4).\n\nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased \nserum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human \nleukocyte interferon.\n\nIntronA must be used with caution in fertile men.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female \npartners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SPC).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA \nis to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\n \n\n\n\n84\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior \nto initiation of treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment \nwith IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from \n6 MIU/m2/week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly \nreported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were \noften reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment.\n\nAdults\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three \ntimes a week. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is \npresented from clinical trials in na\u00efve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to \nmoderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and \npost-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \nfrequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10);\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rarely (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not known. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse

alone.\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n#Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThese undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone.\n\nThe undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is \nadministered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For \nexample, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of \nfatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flu-\nlike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C \ntrials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of \npatients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower \ndoses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment. \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \n\n \n\n\n\n87\n\nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha \ninterferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or \naggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).\n\nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than \n10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in \nhaemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and \nserum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase \nin serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp.\n\nChildren and adolescent population \nChronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due \nto adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent \npopulation studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specific \nconcern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of \n9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during \ntreatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of \n44th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean \nbaseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height \npercentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from \nthe start of treatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was \navailable for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 \npercentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks \nwith IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height \nin some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-\nterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropaenia.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and \nadolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings \nof frequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n \n\n\n\n88\n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions very commonly and commonly reported during clinical trials in\nchildren and adolescent patients treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions\nInfection and infestations\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nViral infection, pharyngitis\nFungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, otitis \nmedia, tooth abscess, herpes simplex, urinary tract infection, \nvaginitis, gastroenteritis\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps)\nCommon: Neoplasm (unspecified)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnaemia, neutropaenia\nThrombocytopaenia, lymphadenopathy\n\nEndocrine disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHypothyroidism\u00a7, \nHyperthyroidism\u00a7, virilism\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnorexia\nHypertriglyceridemia\u00a7, hyperuricemia, increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDepression, emotional lability, insomnia\nSuicidal ideation, aggressive reaction, confusion, behaviour \ndisorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, nervousness, sleep \ndisorder, abnormal dreaming, apathy\n\nNervous system disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHeadache, dizziness\nHyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, hypoaesthesia, \nhyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, somnolence\n\nEye disorders\nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland disorder\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Flushing, pallor\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, nasal \n\nirritation, rhinorrhea, sneezing\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain\nMouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, right upper \nquadrant pain, dyspepsia, glossitis, gastroesophageal reflux, rectal \ndisorder, gastrointestinal disorder, constipation, loose stools, \ntoothache, tooth disorder\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAlopecia, rash\nPhotosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, eczema, acne, skin \ndisorder, nail disorder, skin discolouration, pruritus, dry skin, \nerythema, bruise, sweating increased\n\n \n\n\n\n89\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, vaginal \n\ndisorder\nMale: testicular pain\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\nVery common:\n\nCommon:\n\nInjection site inflammation, injection site reaction, fatigue, rigors, \npyrexia\u00a7, influenza-like symptoms\u00a7, malaise, irritability\nChest pain, asthenia, oedema, injection site pain\n\nInvestigations\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\u00a7\n\nInjury and poisoning\nCommon: Skin laceration\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for \nany pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital \nsigns and close observation of the patient is indicated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05\n\nIntronA is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant \nDNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically \nengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.\n\nThe activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b \nprotein corresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity \nof the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of \nhuman leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately \n15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or \nvarious synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: \nalpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain \nseveral different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha \ninterferons have been identified. IntronA has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n90\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain \nmonkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure \nto human type 1 interferons.\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a \ncomplex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought \nthat this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, \nincluding inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and \nsuch immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and \naugmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities \nmay contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both \nanimal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has \ndemonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates \nthat therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been \nobserved. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity \nand mortality has been observed.\n\nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic \nactive hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover \nchildren treated with interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of \ndepression were observed.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response \nrate is 47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon \nwith ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in na\u00efve patients with a \nribavirin dose > 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01).\n\nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical \ntrials in 2,552 interferon-na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nIntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic \nresponse, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/mL), a liver \nbiopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nIntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were \nfollowed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained \nvirologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3.\n\n \n\n\n\n91\n\nCo-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C in na\u00efve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are \nprognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the \ncombination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The \nrelative benefit of combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most \ndifficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3).\n\nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who \nreceived IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received \uf0b3 80 % of their treatment had a higher \nsustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment \n(56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).\n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with IntronA + ribavirin (one year of treatment) by \ngenotype and viral load\n\nHCV Genotype I\nN=503\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC/I98-580\n\nAll Genotypes 16 % 41 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 9 % 29 % 33 %\n\nGenotype 1 \n\uf0a3 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n25 % 33 % 45 %\n\nGenotype 1\n> 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n3 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 31 % 65 % 79 %\n\nI IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week)\nI/R IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day)\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, \npatients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received \npegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is \npresented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which \nenrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with \nHIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) plus \nribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled \n95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. \nPatients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 \u00b5g /week based on \nweight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin \n(800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period \nof 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/mL \n(Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.\n\n \n\n\n\n92\n\nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after IntronA in combination with \nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients\n\nStudy 11 Study 22\n\npegylated \ninterferon alfa-\n2b  (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/\n\nweek) + \nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\nIntronA \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\np \nvaluea\n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor \n\n150c \u00b5g/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800-\n1,200 mg)d\n\nIntronA \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800-\n\n1,200 mg)d\np \n\nvalueb\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017\n\nGenotype 1, \n4\n\n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007\n\nGenotype 2, \n3\n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730\n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.\na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.\nb:  p value based on chi-square test.\nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 \u00b5g/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects \u2265 75 kg received 150 \u00b5g/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b.\nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.\n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.\n\nRelapse patients \nA total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA \nmonotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA \nincreased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV \n(< 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was \nsustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment.\n\nLong-Term efficacy data\nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b or non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic \nresponse and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients \ncompleted at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of \n492 relapsed during this study. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with \na 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients \nwith cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nChronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population\nThree clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and \nribavirin and one with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin \nwere less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day \n\n \n\n\n\n93\n\nfor 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % \nmale, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly \nconsisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained \nvirological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack \nof data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the \npotential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nStudy results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents\n\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n+\n\nribavirin 15 mg/kg/day\n\nOverall Responsea (n=118) 54 (46 %)*\n\nGenotype 1 (n=92) 33 (36 %)*\n\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n=26) 21 (81 %)*\n\n*Number (%) of patients\na Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period\n\nLong-term efficacy data \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nResults from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin\nIn a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic \nhepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 \uf06dg/m2 plus ribavirin \n15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and \n63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs \nsection 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n \n\n\n\n94\n\nTable 6 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects\n\nn = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\n\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\n\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\n\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\n\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \n\ndetection=125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\n\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m2\n\nand 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly \nand as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following \nsubcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the \nlower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon \ninjections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels \nwere below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and \nintramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %.\n\nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular \nadministration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The \nelimination half-life was approximately two hours.\n\nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of \nadministration.\n\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received \nIntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies \nwhich neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors \ndeveloping in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. \nThe detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of \nresponse or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was \nobserved apparently due to the low titres.\n\nChildren and adolescent population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7. The \npharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or \nadolescents.\n\n \n\n\n\n95\n\nTable 7 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for IntronA and ribavirin \ncapsules when administered to children or adolescents with chronic hepatitis C\n\nParameter Ribavirin\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n\n(n = 17)\n\nIntronA\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for IntronA\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with \n20 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in \nmonkeys given 100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months.\n\nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been \nobserved (see section 4.4).\n\nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic \nin rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in \noffspring of treated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca \nmulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose \nof 2 million IU/m2. Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and \n30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups \n(corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of \n2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-\nrelated anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus monkeys.\n\nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events.\n\nIntronA plus ribavirin\nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon \nalfa-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results \nhave demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with \nribavirin (see section 5.3 of Rebetol SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with \nribavirin).\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nTreatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral \nreplication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or \nfibrosis.\n\nChronic hepatitis C \nBefore initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical \ntrials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1).\n\nAdult patients \nIntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA \n(HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4).\n\nThe best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents\nIntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. \n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nTreatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.\n\n \n\n\n\n99\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nMonotherapy \nTreatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia.\nClinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is \nobtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by < 34 % Ph+ \nleukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is \uf0b3 34 %, but < 90 % Ph+ cells in the \nmarrow.\n\nCombination therapy \nThe combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months \nof treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses \nand to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b \nmonotherapy.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nAs maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction \nin myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.\nCurrent clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the \nplateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nTreatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction \nchemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of \nthe following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each > 3 cm), \nsystemic symptoms (weight loss > 10 %, pyrexia > 38\u00b0C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), \nsplenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or \nepidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nTreatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\".\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic \nrecurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease.\n\nNot all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and \nstrength must be selected.\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the \ndose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent \nintolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment \nwith IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for \nmaintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nThe recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a \nweek (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.\n\nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders \n(white blood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment \nshould be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) \nor severe thrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3).\n\n \n\n\n\n100\n\nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment \n(at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nAdults\nIntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) \nto adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination \nwith ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food \n(morning and evening). \n\n(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for \ncombination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see \nribavirin oral solution SPC.)\n\nRelapse patients (adults)\nIntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are \navailable for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin for 6 months.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (adults)\nThe efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.\n\n- IntronA in combination with ribavirin\nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months.\n\nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who \nexhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment \nsample) and high pre-treatment viral load.\n\nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment \n(HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment).\n\n- IntronA alone\nThe optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of \nbetween 12 and 18 months is advised.\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA.\n\nNa\u00efve patients (children and adolescents)\nThe efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and \nadolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C. \n\nDuration of treatment for children and adolescents\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve \n\nvirological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders \n\n \n\n\n\n101\n\n(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent \npatients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 \nHCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA \nat treatment week 24.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.\n\nHairy cell leukaemia\nThe recommended dose is 2 million IU/m2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every \nother day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell \nleukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of \nIntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet \ncount and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained \nunless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukaemia\nThe recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some \npatients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m2 administered daily subcutaneously \nin association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per \nmonth (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, \nadminister the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m2 daily) to maintain \nhaematological remission.\n\nIntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial \nhaematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nMaintenance therapy \nIn patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following \ninitial induction chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, \nsubcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m2 three times a week (every other day).\n\nFollicular lymphoma\nAdjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of \n5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens \nare advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone).\n\nCarcinoid tumour\nThe usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week \n(every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The \ntreatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long \nas the patient responds to interferon alfa-2b treatment.\n\nMalignant melanoma\nAs induction therapy, interferon alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of 20 million IU/m2\n\ndaily for five days a week for a four-week period; the calculated interferon alfa-2b dose is added to \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see \nsection 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m2 administered \nsubcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.\n\nIf severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes \ndecrease to < 500/mm3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to \n> 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. \nInterferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after \ndose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to < 250/mm3 or ALT/AST rises to > 10 x upper limit of \nnormal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n102\n\nAlthough the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at \nthe recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.\n\nIntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders. \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).\n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.\n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with \n\nimmunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.\n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant \n\nrecipients.\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment.\n- Combination of IntronA with telbivudine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \nobserved in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly \nduring the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult \npatients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes \ndirected against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of \nmental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of \nthese undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and \nthe patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:\nIf treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised \ndiagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse:\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \n\n \n\n\n\n103\n\nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\nChildren and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)\nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to \n48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy \nwith standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile \ndecrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off \ntreatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and \ndemonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of \ntreatment.\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted \n\nin reduced final adult height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence\n\nof disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to \ninterferon alfa-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, \ndiscontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate \ninterruption of treatment.\n\nAdverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities\nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in \nsome cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and \ndeath in patients with cirrhosis.\nDiscontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition.\nAny patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored \nclosely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress.\nLiver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nHypotension\nHypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require \nsupportive treatment.\n\nNeed for adequate hydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\n \n\n\n\n104\n\nPatients with debilitating medical conditions\nIntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone \nto ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., \nthrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.\n\nPulmonary conditions\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any \npatient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray \ntaken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function \nimpairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. \nWhile this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon \nalpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. \nPrompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to \nbe associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nOcular adverse events\nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous \nretinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after \ntreatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms \nduring treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual \nexaminations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may \nbe associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA \nshould be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nObtundation, coma and encephalopathy\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in \nsome patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a \nfew patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high \ndoses of IntronA.\n\nPatients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is \nrecommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced \nstages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac \narrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require \ndiscontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac \ndisease.\n\nHypertriglyceridemia\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nPatients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nIntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\nKidney and liver graft rejection\nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of \nkidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.\n\n \n\n\n\n105\n\nAuto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nConcomitant chemotherapy \nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered \nmedicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events \ninclude mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of \nthe risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the \nconcomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the \nfrequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases \n(i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nMonotherapy \nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, \n2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by \nconventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid \nstatus is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, \nevaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that \ntime must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can \nbe maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of \nIntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid \ndysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for \nchildren and adolescents).\n\nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents\nApproximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy \ndeveloped increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease \nbelow the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated \nand any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA \ntherapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid \ndysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid \nabnormalities are detected, the patient\u2019s thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically \nappropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid \ndysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\n \n\n\n\n106\n\nHCV/HIV Coinfection\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at \nincreased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to \nHAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy \nand zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin \nmay increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nLaboratory Tests \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be \nconducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA.\n\nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, \nand every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to \ngreater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and \nsymptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be \nmonitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin.\n\nIn patients treated for malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and \ndifferential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the \nmaintenance phase of therapy.\n\nEffect on fertility\nInterferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of IntronA \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mL, i.e., essentially \n\"sodium-free\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nIntronA.\n\n \n\n\n\n107\n\nInteractions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution \nmust be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant \ntherapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives \ntheophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline \nlevels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.\n\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been \nobserved rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The \naetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, \na Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).\n\nAdministration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and \nduration) (see section 4.4).\n\nAlso see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased \nserum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human \nleukocyte interferon.\n\nIntronA must be used with caution in fertile men.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female \npartners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SPC).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA \nis to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin \nRibavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\n \n\n\n\n108\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior \nto initiation of treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment \nwith IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from \n6 MIU/m2/week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly \nreported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were \noften reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment.\n\nAdults\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three \ntimes a week. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is \npresented from clinical trials in na\u00efve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to \nmoderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and \npost-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \nfrequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10);\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rarely (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not known. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse

alone.\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n#Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThese undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone.\n\nThe undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is \nadministered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For \nexample, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of \nfatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flu-\nlike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C \ntrials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of \npatients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower \ndoses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment. \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \n\n \n\n\n\n111\n\nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha \ninterferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or \naggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).\n\nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than \n10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in \nhaemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and \nserum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase \nin serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp.\n\nChildren and adolescent population \nChronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due \nto adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent \npopulation studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specific \nconcern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of \n9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during \ntreatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of \n44th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean \nbaseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height \npercentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from \nthe start of treatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was \navailable for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 \npercentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks \nwith IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height \nin some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-\nterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropaenia.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and \nadolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings \nof frequency using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n \n\n\n\n112\n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions very commonly and commonly reported during clinical trials in\nchildren and adolescent patients treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions\nInfection and infestations\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nViral infection, pharyngitis\nFungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, otitis \nmedia, tooth abscess, herpes simplex, urinary tract infection, \nvaginitis, gastroenteritis\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps)\nCommon: Neoplasm (unspecified)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnaemia, neutropaenia\nThrombocytopaenia, lymphadenopathy\n\nEndocrine disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHypothyroidism\u00a7, \nHyperthyroidism\u00a7, virilism\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAnorexia\nHypertriglyceridemia\u00a7, hyperuricemia, increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDepression, emotional lability, insomnia\nSuicidal ideation, aggressive reaction, confusion, behaviour \ndisorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, nervousness, sleep \ndisorder, abnormal dreaming, apathy\n\nNervous system disorders\u00a7\n\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nHeadache, dizziness\nHyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, hypoaesthesia, \nhyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, somnolence\n\nEye disorders\nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland disorder\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Flushing, pallor\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, nasal \n\nirritation, rhinorrhea, sneezing\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain\nMouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, right upper \nquadrant pain, dyspepsia, glossitis, gastroesophageal reflux, rectal \ndisorder, gastrointestinal disorder, constipation, loose stools, \ntoothache, tooth disorder\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \nVery common:\nCommon:\n\nAlopecia, rash\nPhotosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, eczema, acne, skin \ndisorder, nail disorder, skin discolouration, pruritus, dry skin, \nerythema, bruise, sweating increased\n\n \n\n\n\n113\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, vaginal \n\ndisorder\nMale: testicular pain\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\nVery common:\n\nCommon:\n\nInjection site inflammation, injection site reaction, fatigue, rigors, \npyrexia\u00a7, influenza-like symptoms\u00a7, malaise, irritability\nChest pain, asthenia, oedema, injection site pain\n\nInvestigations\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\u00a7\n\nInjury and poisoning\nCommon: Skin laceration\n\u00a7See section 4.4\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for \nany pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital \nsigns and close observation of the patient is indicated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05\n\nIntronA is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant \nDNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically \nengineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes.\n\nThe activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b \nprotein corresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity \nof the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of \nhuman leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately \n15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or \nvarious synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: \nalpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain \nseveral different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha \ninterferons have been identified. IntronA has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n114\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain \nmonkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure \nto human type 1 interferons.\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a \ncomplex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought \nthat this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, \nincluding inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and \nsuch immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and \naugmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities \nmay contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both \nanimal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has \ndemonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nChronic hepatitis B\nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates \nthat therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been \nobserved. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity \nand mortality has been observed.\n\nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic \nactive hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover \nchildren treated with interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of \ndepression were observed.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response \nrate is 47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon \nwith ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in na\u00efve patients with a \nribavirin dose > 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01).\n\nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical \ntrials in 2,552 interferon-na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nIntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic \nresponse, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/mL), a liver \nbiopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nIntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were \nfollowed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained \nvirologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with \nIntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3.\n\n \n\n\n\n115\n\nCo-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for \nthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C in na\u00efve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are \nprognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the \ncombination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The \nrelative benefit of combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most \ndifficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3).\n\nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who \nreceived IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received \uf0b3 80 % of their treatment had a higher \nsustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment \n(56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).\n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with IntronA + ribavirin (one year of treatment) by \ngenotype and viral load\n\nHCV Genotype I\nN=503\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC95-132/I95-143\n\nI/R\nN=505\n\nC/I98-580\n\nAll Genotypes 16 % 41 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 9 % 29 % 33 %\n\nGenotype 1 \n\uf0a3 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n25 % 33 % 45 %\n\nGenotype 1\n> 2 million \ncopies/mL\n\n3 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 31 % 65 % 79 %\n\nI IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week)\nI/R IntronA (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day)\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, \npatients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received \npegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is \npresented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which \nenrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with \nHIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) plus \nribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled \n95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. \nPatients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 \u00b5g /week based on \nweight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin \n(800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period \nof 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/mL \n(Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.\n\n \n\n\n\n116\n\nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after IntronA in combination with \nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients\n\nStudy 11 Study 22\n\npegylated \ninterferon alfa-\n2b  (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/\n\nweek) + \nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\nIntronA \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\np \nvaluea\n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor \n\n150c \u00b5g/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800-\n1,200 mg)d\n\nIntronA \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800-\n\n1,200 mg)d\np \n\nvalueb\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017\n\nGenotype 1, \n4\n\n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007\n\nGenotype 2, \n3\n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730\n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.\na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.\nb:  p value based on chi-square test.\nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 \u00b5g/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects \u2265 75 kg received 150 \u00b5g/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b.\nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.\n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.\n\nRelapse patients \nA total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA \nmonotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA \nincreased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV \n(< 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was \nsustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment.\n\nLong-Term efficacy data\nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b or non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic \nresponse and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients \ncompleted at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of \n492 relapsed during this study. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with \na 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients \nwith cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nChronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population\n\nThree clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and \nribavirin and one with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin \nwere less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day \n\n \n\n\n\n117\n\nfor 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % \nmale, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly \nconsisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained \nvirological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack \nof data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the \npotential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nStudy results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents\n\nIntronA 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n+\n\nribavirin 15 mg/kg/day\n\nOverall Responsea (n=118) 54 (46 %)*\n\nGenotype 1 (n=92) 33 (36 %)*\n\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n=26) 21 (81 %)*\n\n*Number (%) of patients\na Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period\n\nLong-term efficacy data \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nResults from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin\nIn a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic \nhepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 \uf06dg/m2 plus ribavirin \n15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and \n63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs \nsection 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n \n\n\n\n118\n\nTable 6 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects\n\nn = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\n\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\n\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\n\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\n\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \n\ndetection=125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\n\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m2\n\nand 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly \nand as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following \nsubcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the \nlower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon \ninjections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels \nwere below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and \nintramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %.\n\nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular \nadministration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The \nelimination half-life was approximately two hours.\n\nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of \nadministration.\n\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received \nIntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies \nwhich neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors \ndeveloping in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. \nThe detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of \nresponse or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was \nobserved apparently due to the low titres.\n\nChildren and adolescent population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7. The \npharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or \nadolescents.\n\n \n\n\n\n119\n\nTable 7 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for IntronA and ribavirin \ncapsules when administered to children or adolescents with chronic hepatitis C\n\nParameter Ribavirin\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n\n(n = 17)\n\nIntronA\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for IntronA\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with \n20 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in \nmonkeys given 100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months.\n\nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been \nobserved (see section 4.4).\n\nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic \nin rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in \noffspring of treated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca \nmulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose \nof 2 million IU/m2. Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and \n30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups \n(corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of \n2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-\nrelated anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus monkeys.\n\nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events.\n\nIntronA plus ribavirin \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon \nalfa-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results \nhave demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with \nribavirin (see section 5.3 of Rebetol SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with \nribavirin).\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What IntronA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n3. How to use IntronA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store IntronA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What IntronA is and what it is used for\n\nIntronA (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections \nand severe diseases. \n\nIntronA is used in adult patients to treat certain disorders that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph \nglands, or skin and may extend into the body. Included are hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myelogenous \nleukaemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, carcinoid tumour, and malignant melanoma. \n\nIntronA is also used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver.\n\nIntronA is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents who \nhave previously untreated chronic hepatitis C.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n\nDo not use IntronA\n- if you are allergic to interferon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you have severe heart disease.\n- if you have poor kidney or liver function.\n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease.\n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medicines that suppress the immune \n\nsystem (other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine).\n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions).\n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking \n\nmedicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from \ninfection).\n\n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled.\n- if you are being treated with telbivudine (see section \"Other medicines and IntronA\").\n\n \n\n\n\n145\n\nChildren and adolescents:\n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of \n\nsuicide.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IntronA\n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d).\n- if you are being treated for mental illness or had treatment in the past for any other nervous or \n\nmental disorder, including depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection) or suicidal or \nhomicidal behaviour (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). The use of interferon alfa-2b in \nchildren and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is \ncontraindicated (see section \u201cDo not use IntronA\u201d). \n\n- if you have cirrhosis or other liver problems (other than hepatitis B or C).\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with IntronA.\n- when receiving IntronA, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check \n\nwith your doctor if you think you are getting an infection.\n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, \n\nor any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.\n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately.\n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or \n\nhives) while on this medicine seek medical help immediately.\n- if you are also being treated for HIV (see section \u201cOther medicines and IntronA\u201d).\n- if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may \n\nwant to monitor you more closely.\n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase \n\nthe risk of rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nIntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of \nbreathing irregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, \ndiabetes, or high or low blood pressure.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide, or have a history of substance abuse (e.g., \nalcohol or drugs).\n\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medicine shosaikoto.\n\nOther medicines and IntronA\nIntronA will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or \ntaking sleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medicines. \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other \nmedicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some \nmedicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.\n\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects \nassociated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are \nreceiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and \nof liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be \n\n \n\n\n\n146\n\nsure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin \ncombination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of \nred blood cells).\n\nIf you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, \nyour risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the \narms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of \nIntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nIntronA with food and drink and alcohol\nWhile being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known.\nIf you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an \nunborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity \nif there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before \ntreatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use \nan effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a \ncondom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. If your female \npartner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month \nduring treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your \ndoctor. If you are a male patient, you a or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the \ntime you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with \nyour doctor.\n\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant \nif you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective \ninforming texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use machines if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from using this medicine.\n\nIntronA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".\n\n3. How to use IntronA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor has prescribed IntronA specifically for you and your current \ncondition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.\n\nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of IntronA according to your individual \nneeds. The dosage will vary according to the disease being treated.\n\nIf you are injecting IntronA yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is \nclearly provided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a \nweek are best given every other day.\n\n \n\n\n\n147\n\nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor \nmay change your dose based on your specific needs:\n\nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously \n(under the skin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents - 3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) \nin combination with ribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).\n\nHairy Cell Leukaemia: 2 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic Myelogenous Leukaemia: 4-5 million IU/m2 daily injected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nMultiple myeloma: 3 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nFollicular lymphoma: Adjunctively with chemotherapy, 5 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) \ninjected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nCarcinoid tumour: 5 million IU, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nMalignant melanoma, induction therapy: 20 million IU/m2, intravenously, given daily for 5 days a week \nfor a 4 week period. Maintenance treatment: 10 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected \nsubcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of IntronA alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g., \ncytarabine, ribavirin). If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with another medicine, please refer \nalso to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the \nexact dosage schedule and regimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of \nIntronA is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nSubcutaneous use:\nIntronA is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that IntronA is injected with a short needle \ninto the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed \nhow to prepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided \nwith this leaflet (see section \u201cHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\u201d at the end of the leaflet).\n\nIntravenous infusion:\nThe infusion must be prepared immediately prior to use. Any size vial may be used to measure the \nrequired dose; however, final concentration of interferon in sodium chloride solution must be not less \nthan 0.3 million IU/mL. The appropriate dose of IntronA is withdrawn from the vial(s), added to \n50 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection in a PVC bag or glass bottle for \nintravenous use and administered over 20 minutes.\n\nNo other medicinal product can be infused concomitantly with IntronA.\n\nOne dose of IntronA is given on each scheduled day. IntronA is given either daily (5 or 7 times a week), \nor three times a week, every other day, for example on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may \ncause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this medicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at \nbedtime.\n\n \n\n\n\n148\n\nUse IntronA exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take \nIntronA for as long as prescribed.\n\nIf you use more IntronA than you should\nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use IntronA\nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue \ntreatment as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to \ninject this medicine every day, and you accidentally missed a full day\u2019s dose, continue treatment at the \nusual dose the following day. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if needed.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although \nnot all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system: \nSome people get depressed when taking IntronA alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and \nin some cases people had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or aggressive \nbehaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have actually committed suicide. Be sure \nto seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or \nchange in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help \nyou stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with \nIntronA and ribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display any \nunusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others.\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents): \nDuring the one year of treatment with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, some children and \nadolescents did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. Some children did not reach their \nprojected height within 10-12 years after completing treatment.\n\nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking IntronA and tell your doctor immediately or go \nto the casualty department at your nearest hospital:\n- swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting.\nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction \nto IntronA. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects \nare very rare.\n\nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n- chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, \n\nconfusion, difficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; \nseizure (convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal \nthoughts, suicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed \nagainst others), hallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or \nurine, severe nosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a \nfew weeks of treatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or \nyour eyesight or hearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or \nmucous membrane.\n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. Your doctor will test \nyour blood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that \ncarry iron and oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at \n\n \n\n\n\n149\n\nacceptable levels. Moderate and usually reversible reduction in all three blood elements-white blood \ncells, red blood cells and platelets, has been reported.\n\nAt the beginning of treatment with IntronA, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, \nfatigue, headache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take \nparacetamol if you develop these symptoms.\n\nPossible side effects listed below are grouped by frequency of occurrence:\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10)\nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100)\nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000)\nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000)\nVery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000)\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nThe following side effects have been reported:\n\nVery commonly reported side effects: \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional \nlability, insomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like \nreaction, feeling of general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood \nswings, coughing (sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe \nmuscle pain, joint pain, musculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased \nwhite blood cell count.

Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-\ninject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirement of self-injection.\n\nPreparation\nCollect necessary items before you begin:\n- a vial of IntronA solution for injection;\n- a syringe (for example 1 mL);\n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]);\n- a cleansing swab.\nWash your hands carefully.\n\nMeasuring the dose of IntronA\nRemove the cap from the vial. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA \nsolution with a cleansing swab.\nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place \nit firmly onto the tip of the syringe.\nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the \nplunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor.\nHold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.\nInsert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial.\nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA \nsolution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw \nthe correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull \nthe plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles \ndisappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the \nsyringe with the needle on a flat surface.\n\nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe \nbetween your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. \nDo not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and \nmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use \nthis site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or \nouter surface of the arm for injection.\nChange your injection site each time.\n\nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the \nneedle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you \nwould a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Inject the solution by \npushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the \ninjection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage \nthe injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.\nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and \nneedle safely in a closed container.\n\n \n\n\n\n154\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nIntronA 5 million IU/0.5 mL solution for injection or infusion\nInterferon alfa-2b\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What IntronA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n3. How to use IntronA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store IntronA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What IntronA is and what it is used for\n\nIntronA (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections \nand severe diseases. \n\nIntronA is used in adult patients to treat certain disorders that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph \nglands, or skin and may extend into the body. Included are hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myelogenous \nleukaemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, carcinoid tumour, and malignant melanoma. \n\nIntronA is also used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver.\n\nIntronA is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents who \nhave previously untreated chronic hepatitis C.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n\nDo not use IntronA\n- if you are allergic  to interferon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you have severe heart disease.\n- if you have poor kidney or liver function.\n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease.\n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medicines that suppress the immune \n\nsystem (other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine).\n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions).\n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking \n\nmedicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from \ninfection).\n\n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled.\n- if you are being treated with telbivudine (see section \"Other medicines and IntronA\").\n\n \n\n\n\n155\n\nChildren and adolescents:\n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of \n\nsuicide.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IntronA\n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d).\n- if you are being treated for mental illness or had treatment in the past for any other nervous or \n\nmental disorder, including depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection) or suicidal or \nhomicidal behaviour (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). The use of interferon alfa-2b in \nchildren and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is \ncontraindicated (see section \u201cDo not use IntronA\u201d). \n\n- if you have cirrhosis or other liver problems (other than hepatitis B or C).\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with IntronA.\n- when receiving IntronA, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check \n\nwith your doctor if you think you are getting an infection.\n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, \n\nor any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.\n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately.\n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or \n\nhives) while on this medicine seek medical help immediately.\n- if you are also being treated for HIV (see section \u201cOther medicines and IntronA\u201d).\n- if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may\n\nwant to monitor you more closely.\n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase \n\nthe risk of rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nIntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of \nbreathing irregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, \ndiabetes, or high or low blood pressure.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide, or have a history of substance abuse (e.g., \nalcohol or drugs).\n\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medicine shosaikoto.\n\nOther medicines and IntronA\nIntronA will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or \ntaking sleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medicines.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other \nmedicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some \nmedicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.\n\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects \nassociated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are \nreceiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and \nof liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be \n\n \n\n\n\n156\n\nsure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin \ncombination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of \nred blood cells).\n\nIf you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, \nyour risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the \narms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of \nIntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nIntronA with food and drink and alcohol\nWhile being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known.\nIf you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an \nunborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity \nif there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before \ntreatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use \nan effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a \ncondom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. If your female \npartner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month \nduring treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your \ndoctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the \ntime you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with \nyour doctor.\n\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant \nif you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective \ninforming texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use machines if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from using this medicine.\n\nIntronA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".\n\n3. How to use IntronA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor has prescribed IntronA specifically for you and your current \ncondition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.\n\nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of IntronA according to your individual \nneeds. The dosage will vary according to the disease being treated.\n\nIf you are injecting IntronA yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is \nclearly provided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a \nweek are best given every other day.\n\n \n\n\n\n157\n\nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor \nmay change your dose based on your specific needs:\n\nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously \n(under the skin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents - 3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) \nin combination with ribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).\n\nHairy Cell Leukaemia: 2 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic Myelogenous Leukaemia: 4-5 million IU/m2 daily injected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nMultiple myeloma: 3 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nFollicular lymphoma: Adjunctively with chemotherapy, 5 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) \ninjected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nCarcinoid tumour: 5 million IU, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nMalignant melanoma, induction therapy: 20 million IU/m2, intravenously, given daily for 5 days a week \nfor a 4 week period. Maintenance treatment: 10 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected \nsubcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of IntronA alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g., \ncytarabine, ribavirin). If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with another medicine, please refer \nalso to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the \nexact dosage schedule and regimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of \nIntronA is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nSubcutaneous use:\nIntronA is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that IntronA is injected with a short needle\ninto the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed \nhow to prepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided \nwith this leaflet (see section \u201cHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\u201d at the end of the leaflet).\n\nIntravenous infusion:\nThe infusion must be prepared immediately prior to use. Any size vial may be used to measure the \nrequired dose; however, final concentration of interferon in sodium chloride solution must be not less \nthan 0.3 million IU/mL. The appropriate dose of IntronA is withdrawn from the vial(s), added to \n50 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection in a PVC bag or glass bottle for \nintravenous use and administered over 20 minutes.\n\nNo other medicinal product can be infused concomitantly with IntronA.\n\nOne dose of IntronA is given on each scheduled day. IntronA is given either daily (5 or 7 times a week), \nor three times a week, every other day, for example on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may \ncause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this medicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at \nbedtime.\n\n \n\n\n\n158\n\nUse IntronA exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take \nIntronA for as long as prescribed.\n\nIf you use more IntronA than you should\nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use IntronA\nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking IntronA in\ncombination with ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue \ntreatment as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to \ninject this medicine every day, and you accidentally missed a full day\u2019s dose, continue treatment at the \nusual dose the following day. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if needed.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although \nnot all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system: \nSome people get depressed when taking IntronA alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and \nin some cases people had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or aggressive \nbehaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have actually committed suicide. Be sure \nto seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or \nchange in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help \nyou stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with \nIntronA and ribavirin.

Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-\ninject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirement of self-injection.\n\nPreparation\nCollect necessary items before you begin:\n- a vial of IntronA solution for injection;\n- a syringe (for example 1 mL);\n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]);\n- a cleansing swab.\nWash your hands carefully.\n\nMeasuring the dose of IntronA\nRemove the cap from the vial. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA \nsolution with a cleansing swab.\nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place \nit firmly onto the tip of the syringe.\nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the \nplunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor.\nHold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.\nInsert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial.\nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA \nsolution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw \nthe correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull \nthe plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles \ndisappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the \nsyringe with the needle on a flat surface.\n\nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe \nbetween your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. \nDo not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and \nmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use \nthis site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or \nouter surface of the arm for injection.\nChange your injection site each time.\n\nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the \nneedle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you \nwould a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Inject the solution by \npushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the \ninjection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage \nthe injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.\nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and \nneedle safely in a closed container.\n\n \n\n\n\n164\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nIntronA 10 million IU/mL solution for injection or infusion\nInterferon alfa-2b\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet.

Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nIntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of \nbreathing irregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, \ndiabetes, or high or low blood pressure.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide, or have a history of substance abuse (e.g., \nalcohol or drugs).\n\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medicine shosaikoto.\n\nOther medicines and IntronA\nIntronA will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or \ntaking sleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medicines.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other \nmedicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some \nmedicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.\n\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects \nassociated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are \nreceiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and \nof liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be \n\n \n\n\n\n166\n\nsure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin \ncombination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of \nred blood cells).\n\nIf you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, \nyour risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the \narms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of \nIntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nIntronA with food and drink and alcohol\nWhile being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known.\nIf you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an \nunborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity \nif there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before \ntreatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use \nan effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a \ncondom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. If your female \npartner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month \nduring treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your \ndoctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the \ntime you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with \nyour doctor.\n\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant \nif you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective \ninforming texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use machines if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from using this medicine.\n\nIntronA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".\n\n3. How to use IntronA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor has prescribed IntronA specifically for you and your current \ncondition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.\n\nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of IntronA according to your individual \nneeds. The dosage will vary according to the disease being treated.\n\nIf you are injecting IntronA yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is \nclearly provided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a \nweek are best given every other day.\n\n \n\n\n\n167\n\nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor \nmay change your dose based on your specific needs:\n\nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously \n(under the skin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents - 3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) \nin combination with ribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).\n\nHairy Cell Leukaemia: 2 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic Myelogenous Leukaemia: 4-5 million IU/m2 daily injected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nMultiple myeloma: 3 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nFollicular lymphoma: Adjunctively with chemotherapy, 5 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) \ninjected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nCarcinoid tumour: 5 million IU, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nMalignant melanoma, induction therapy: 20 million IU/m2, intravenously, given daily for 5 days a week \nfor a 4 week period. Maintenance treatment: 10 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected \nsubcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of IntronA alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g., \ncytarabine, ribavirin). If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with another medicine, please refer \nalso to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the \nexact dosage schedule and regimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of \nIntronA is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nSubcutaneous use:\nIntronA is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that IntronA is injected with a short needle \ninto the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed \nhow to prepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided \nwith this leaflet (see section \u201cHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\u201d at the end of the leaflet).\n\nIntravenous infusion:\nThe infusion must be prepared immediately prior to use. Any size vial may be used to measure the \nrequired dose; however, final concentration of interferon in sodium chloride solution must be not less \nthan 0.3 million IU/mL. The appropriate dose of IntronA is withdrawn from the vial(s), added to \n50 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection in a PVC bag or glass bottle for \nintravenous use and administered over 20 minutes.\n\nNo other medicinal product can be infused concomitantly with IntronA.\n\nOne dose of IntronA is given on each scheduled day. IntronA is given either daily (5 or 7 times a week), \nor three times a week, every other day, for example on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may \ncause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this medicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at \nbedtime.\n\n \n\n\n\n168\n\nUse IntronA exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take \nIntronA for as long as prescribed.\n\nIf you use more IntronA than you should\nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use IntronA\nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue \ntreatment as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to \ninject this medicine every day, and you accidentally missed a full day\u2019s dose, continue treatment at the \nusual dose the following day. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if needed.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although \nnot all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system: \nSome people get depressed when taking IntronA alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and \nin some cases people had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or aggressive \nbehaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have actually committed suicide. Be sure \nto seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or \nchange in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help \nyou stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with \nIntronA and ribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display any \nunusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others.\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents): \nDuring the one year of treatment with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, some children and \nadolescents did not grow or gain weight as much as expected.

Your doctor will test \nyour blood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that \ncarry iron and oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at \n\n \n\n\n\n169\n\nacceptable levels. Moderate and usually reversible reduction in all three blood elements-white blood \ncells, red blood cells and platelets, has been reported.\n\nAt the beginning of treatment with IntronA, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, \nfatigue, headache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take \nparacetamol if you develop these symptoms.\n\nPossible side effects listed below are grouped by frequency of occurrence:\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10)\nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100)\nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000)\nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000)\nVery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000)\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nThe following side effects have been reported:\n\nVery commonly reported side effects: \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional \nlability, insomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like \nreaction, feeling of general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood \nswings, coughing (sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe \nmuscle pain, joint pain, musculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased \nwhite blood cell count.

Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-\ninject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirement of self-injection.\n\nPreparation\nCollect necessary items before you begin:\n- a vial of IntronA solution for injection;\n- a syringe (for example 2 mL);\n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]);\n- a cleansing swab.\nWash your hands carefully.\n\nMeasuring the dose of IntronA\nRemove the cap from the vial. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA \nsolution with a cleansing swab.\nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place \nit firmly onto the tip of the syringe.\nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the \nplunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor.\nHold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.\nInsert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial.\nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA \nsolution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw \nthe correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull \nthe plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles \ndisappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the \nsyringe with the needle on a flat surface.\n\nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe \nbetween your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. \nDo not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and \nmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use \nthis site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or \nouter surface of the arm for injection.\nChange your injection site each time.\n\nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the \nneedle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you \nwould a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Inject the solution by \npushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin.

What IntronA is and what it is used for\n\nIntronA (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections \nand severe diseases. \n\nIntronA is used in adult patients to treat certain disorders that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph \nglands, or skin and may extend into the body. Included are hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myelogenous \nleukaemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, carcinoid tumour, and malignant melanoma. \n\nIntronA is also used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver.\n\nIntronA is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents who \nhave previously untreated chronic hepatitis C.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n\nDo not use IntronA\n- if you are allergic  to interferon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you have severe heart disease.\n- if you have poor kidney or liver function.\n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease.\n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medicines that suppress the immune \n\nsystem (other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine).\n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions).\n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking \n\nmedicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from \ninfection).\n\n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled.\n- if you are being treated with telbivudine (see section \"Other medicines and IntronA\").\n\n \n\n\n\n175\n\nChildren and adolescents:\n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of \n\nsuicide.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IntronA\n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d). \n- if you are being treated for mental illness or had treatment in the past for any other nervous or \n\nmental disorder, including depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection) or suicidal or \nhomicidal behaviour (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). The use of interferon alfa-2b in \nchildren and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is \ncontraindicated (see section \u201cDo not use IntronA\u201d). \n\n- if you have cirrhosis or other liver problems (other than hepatitis B or C).\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with IntronA.\n- when receiving IntronA, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check \n\nwith your doctor if you think you are getting an infection.\n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, \n\nor any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.\n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately.\n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or \n\nhives) while on this medicine seek medical help immediately.\n- if you are also being treated for HIV (see section \u201cOther medicines and IntronA\u201d).\n- if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may \n\nwant to monitor you more closely.\n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase \n\nthe risk of rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nIntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of \nbreathing irregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, \ndiabetes, or high or low blood pressure.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide, or have a history of substance abuse (e.g., \nalcohol or drugs).\n\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medicine shosaikoto.\n\nOther medicines and IntronA\nIntronA will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or \ntaking sleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medicines.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other \nmedicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some \nmedicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.\n\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects \nassociated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are \nreceiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and \nof liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be \n\n \n\n\n\n176\n\nsure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin \ncombination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of \nred blood cells).\n\nIf you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, \nyour risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the \narms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of \nIntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nIntronA with food and drink and alcohol\nWhile being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known.\nIf you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an \nunborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity \nif there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before \ntreatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use \nan effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a \ncondom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. If your female \npartner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month \nduring treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your \ndoctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the \ntime you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with \nyour doctor.\n\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant \nif you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective \ninforming texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use machines if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from using this medicine.\n\nIntronA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 3 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".\n\n3. How to use IntronA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor has prescribed IntronA specifically for you and your current \ncondition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.\n\nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of IntronA according to your individual \nneeds. The dosage will vary according to the disease being treated.\n\nIf you are injecting IntronA yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is \nclearly provided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a \nweek are best given every other day.\n\n \n\n\n\n177\n\nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor \nmay change your dose based on your specific needs:\n\nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously \n(under the skin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents - 3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) \nin combination with ribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).\n\nHairy Cell Leukaemia: 2 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic Myelogenous Leukaemia: 4-5 million IU/m2 daily injected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nMultiple myeloma: 3 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nFollicular lymphoma: Adjunctively with chemotherapy, 5 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) \ninjected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nCarcinoid tumour: 5 million IU, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nMalignant melanoma, induction therapy: 20 million IU/m2, intravenously, given daily for 5 days a week \nfor a 4 week period. Maintenance treatment: 10 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected \nsubcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of IntronA alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g., \ncytarabine, ribavirin). If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with another medicine, please refer \nalso to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the \nexact dosage schedule and regimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of \nIntronA is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nSubcutaneous use:\nIntronA is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that IntronA is injected with a short needle \ninto the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed \nhow to prepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided \nwith this leaflet (see section \u201cHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\u201d at the end of the leaflet).\n\nIntravenous infusion:\nThe infusion must be prepared immediately prior to use. Any size vial may be used to measure the \nrequired dose; however, final concentration of interferon in sodium chloride solution must be not less \nthan 0.3 million IU/mL. The appropriate dose of IntronA is withdrawn from the vial(s), added to \n50 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection in a PVC bag or glass bottle for \nintravenous use and administered over 20 minutes.\n\nNo other medicinal product can be infused concomitantly with IntronA.\n\nOne dose of IntronA is given on each scheduled day. IntronA is given either daily (5 or 7 times a week), \nor three times a week, every other day, for example on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may \ncause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this medicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at \nbedtime.\n\n \n\n\n\n178\n\nUse IntronA exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take \nIntronA for as long as prescribed.\n\nIf you use more IntronA than you should\nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use IntronA\nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue \ntreatment as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to \ninject this medicine every day, and you accidentally missed a full day\u2019s dose, continue treatment at the \nusual dose the following day. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if needed.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although \nnot all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system:\nSome people get depressed when taking IntronA alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and \nin some cases people had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or aggressive \nbehaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have actually committed suicide. Be sure \nto seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or \nchange in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help \nyou stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with \nIntronA and ribavirin.

Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-\ninject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirement of self-injection.\n\nPreparation\nCollect necessary items before you begin:\n- a vial of IntronA solution for injection;\n- a syringe (for example 1 mL);\n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]);\n- a cleansing swab.\nWash your hands carefully.\n\nMeasuring the dose of IntronA\nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution \nwith a cleansing swab.\nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place \nit firmly onto the tip of the syringe.\nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the \nplunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor.\nHold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.\nInsert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial.\nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA \nsolution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw \nthe correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull \nthe plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles \ndisappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. \n\nVolume to be withdrawn according to the dose:\n\nVolume \n(mL)\n\nCorresponding dose (million IU) using IntronA \n18 million IU/3 mL solution for injection or \ninfusion\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n \n\n\n\n185\n\nReplace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.\n\nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe \nbetween your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. \nDo not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and \nmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use \nthis site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or \nouter surface of the arm for injection.\nChange your injection site each time.\n\nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the \nneedle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you \nwould a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Inject the solution by \npushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the \ninjection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage \nthe injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.\nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and \nneedle safely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator.\n\n \n\n\n\n186\n\nHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\nSyringe with an attached needle and a needle protection device\n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject IntronA yourself. Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-\ninject IntronA.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What IntronA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n3. How to use IntronA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store IntronA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What IntronA is and what it is used for\n\nIntronA (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections \nand severe diseases. \n\nIntronA is used in adult patients to treat certain disorders that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph \nglands, or skin and may extend into the body. Included are hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myelogenous \nleukaemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, carcinoid tumour, and malignant melanoma.\n\nIntronA is also used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver.\n\nIntronA is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents who \nhave previously untreated chronic hepatitis C.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use IntronA\n\nDo not use IntronA\n- if you are allergic  to interferon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you have severe heart disease.\n- if you have poor kidney or liver function.\n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease.\n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medicines that suppress the immune \n\nsystem (other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine).\n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions).\n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking \n\nmedicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from \ninfection).\n\n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled.\n- if you are being treated with telbivudine (see section \"Other medicines and IntronA\").\n\n \n\n\n\n190\n\nChildren and adolescents:\n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of \n\nsuicide.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IntronA\n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d). \n- if you are being treated for mental illness or had treatment in the past for any other nervous or \n\nmental disorder, including depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection) or suicidal or \nhomicidal behaviour (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). The use of interferon alfa-2b in \nchildren and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is \ncontraindicated (see section \u201cDo not use IntronA\u201d). \n\n- if you have cirrhosis or other liver problems (other than hepatitis B or C).\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with IntronA.\n- when receiving IntronA, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check \n\nwith your doctor if you think you are getting an infection.\n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, \n\nor any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.\n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately.\n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or \n\nhives) while on this medicine seek medical help immediately.\n- if you are also being treated for HIV (see section \u201cOther medicines and IntronA\u201d).\n- if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may \n\nwant to monitor you more closely.\n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase \n\nthe risk of rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nIntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of \nbreathing irregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, \ndiabetes, or high or low blood pressure.\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide, or have a history of substance abuse (e.g., \nalcohol or drugs).\n\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medicine shosaikoto.\n\nOther medicines and IntronA\nIntronA will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or \ntaking sleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medicines.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other \nmedicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some \nmedicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.\n\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects \nassociated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are \nreceiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and \nof liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be \n\n \n\n\n\n191\n\nsure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin \ncombination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of \nred blood cells).\n\nIf you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interferon product, \nyour risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the \narms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of \nIntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nIntronA with food and drink and alcohol\nWhile being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known.\nIf you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an \nunborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity \nif there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before \ntreatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use \nan effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a \ncondom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. If your female \npartner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month \nduring treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your \ndoctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the \ntime you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with \nyour doctor.\n\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant \nif you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective \ninforming texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use machines if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from using this medicine.\n\nIntronA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".\n\n3. How to use IntronA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor has prescribed IntronA specifically for you and your current \ncondition; do not share this medicine with anyone else.\n\nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of IntronA according to your individual \nneeds. The dosage will vary according to the disease being treated.\n\nIf you are injecting IntronA yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is \nclearly provided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a \nweek are best given every other day.\n\n \n\n\n\n192\n\nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor \nmay change your dose based on your specific needs:\n\nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously \n(under the skin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents - 3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) \nin combination with ribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).\n\nHairy Cell Leukaemia: 2 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under \nthe skin).\n\nChronic Myelogenous Leukaemia: 4-5 million IU/m2 daily injected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nMultiple myeloma: 3 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nFollicular lymphoma: Adjunctively with chemotherapy, 5 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) \ninjected subcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nCarcinoid tumour: 5 million IU, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin).\n\nMalignant melanoma, induction therapy: 20 million IU/m2, intravenously, given daily for 5 days a week \nfor a 4 week period. Maintenance treatment: 10 million IU/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected \nsubcutaneously (under the skin).\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of IntronA alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g., \ncytarabine, ribavirin). If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with another medicine, please refer \nalso to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the \nexact dosage schedule and regimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of \nIntronA is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nSubcutaneous use:\nIntronA is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that IntronA is injected with a short needle \ninto the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed \nhow to prepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided \nwith this leaflet (see section \u201cHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\u201d at the end of the leaflet).\n\nIntravenous infusion:\nThe infusion must be prepared immediately prior to use. Any size vial may be used to measure the \nrequired dose; however, final concentration of interferon in sodium chloride solution must be not less \nthan 0.3 million IU/mL. The appropriate dose of IntronA is withdrawn from the vial(s), added to \n50 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection in a PVC bag or glass bottle for \nintravenous use and administered over 20 minutes.\n\nNo other medicinal product can be infused concomitantly with IntronA.\n\nOne dose of IntronA is given on each scheduled day. IntronA is given either daily (5 or 7 times a week), \nor three times a week, every other day, for example on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may \ncause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this medicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at \nbedtime.\n\n \n\n\n\n193\n\nUse IntronA exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take \nIntronA for as long as prescribed.\n\nIf you use more IntronA than you should\nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use IntronA\nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking IntronA in \ncombination with ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue \ntreatment as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to \ninject this medicine every day, and you accidentally missed a full day\u2019s dose, continue treatment at the \nusual dose the following day. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if needed.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although \nnot all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system:\nSome people get depressed when taking IntronA alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and \nin some cases people had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or aggressive \nbehaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have actually committed suicide. Be sure \nto seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or \nchange in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help \nyou stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with \nIntronA and ribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display any \nunusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others.\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents): \nDuring the one year of treatment with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, some children and \nadolescents did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. Some children did not reach their \nprojected height within 10-12 years after completing treatment.\n\nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking IntronA and tell your doctor immediately or go \nto the casualty department at your nearest hospital:\n- swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting.\nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction \nto IntronA. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects \nare very rare.\n\nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n- chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, \n\nconfusion, difficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; \nseizure (convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal \nthoughts, suicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed \nagainst others), hallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or \nurine, severe nosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a \nfew weeks of treatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or \nyour eyesight or hearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or \nmucous membrane.\n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. Your doctor will test \nyour blood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that \ncarry iron and oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at \n\n \n\n\n\n194\n\nacceptable levels. Moderate and usually reversible reduction in all three blood elements-white blood \ncells, red blood cells and platelets, has been reported.\n\nAt the beginning of treatment with IntronA, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, \nfatigue, headache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take \nparacetamol if you develop these symptoms.\n\nPossible side effects listed below are grouped by frequency of occurrence:\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10)\nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100)\nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000)\nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000)\nVery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000)\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nThe following side effects have been reported:\n\nVery commonly reported side effects: \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional \nlability, insomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like \nreaction, feeling of general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood \nswings, coughing (sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe \nmuscle pain, joint pain, musculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased \nwhite blood cell count.

Please read the instructions \ncarefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-\ninject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and \nrequirement of self-injection.\n\nPreparation\nCollect necessary items before you begin:\n- a vial of IntronA solution for injection;\n- a syringe (for example 1 mL);\n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]);\n- a cleansing swab.\nWash your hands carefully.\n\nMeasuring the dose of IntronA\nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution \nwith a cleansing swab.\nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place \nit firmly onto the tip of the syringe.\nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the \nplunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor.\nHold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.\nInsert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial.\nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA \nsolution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw \nthe correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull \nthe plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles \ndisappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. \n\nVolume to be withdrawn according to the dose:\n\nVolume \n(mL)\n\nCorresponding dose (million IU) using IntronA \n25 million IU/2.5 mL solution for injection or \n\ninfusion\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nReplace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.\n\n \n\n\n\n200\n\nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe \nbetween your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. \nDo not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and \nmuscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use \nthis site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or \nouter surface of the arm for injection.\nChange your injection site each time.\n\nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the \nneedle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you \nwould a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Inject the solution by \npushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the \ninjection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage \nthe injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.\nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and \nneedle safely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator.\n\n \n\n\n\n201\n\nHOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA\nSyringe with an attached needle\n\nThe following instructions explain how to inject IntronA yourself.

"Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. your doctor has prescribed introna specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine with anyone else. your doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of introna according to your individual needs. the dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. if you are injecting introna yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly provided with the package of medicine you receive. dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best given every other day. the usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may change your dose based on your specific needs: chronic hepatitis b: 5 to 10 million iu 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). chronic hepatitis c: adults - 3 million iu 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - 3 million iu/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with ribavirin (please also see ribavirin package leaflet). hairy cell leukaemia: 2 million iu/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). chronic myelogenous leukaemia: 4-5 million iu/m2 daily injected subcutaneously (under the skin). multiple myeloma: 3 million iu/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). follicular lymphoma: adjunctively with chemotherapy, 5 million iu 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). carcinoid tumour: 5 million iu, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). malignant melanoma, induction therapy: 20 million iu/m2, intravenously, given daily for 5 days a week for a 4 week period. maintenance treatment: 10 million iu/m2, 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). your doctor may prescribe a different dose of introna alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g., cytarabine, ribavirin). if you are prescribed introna in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the package leaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and regimen according to your needs. if you have the impression that the effect of introna is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. subcutaneous use: introna is usually intended for subcutaneous use. this means that introna is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet (see section \"how to self inject introna\" at the end of the leaflet). intravenous infusion: the infusion must be prepared immediately prior to use. any size vial may be used to measure the required dose; however, final concentration of interferon in sodium chloride solution must be not less than 0.3 million iu/ml. the appropriate dose of introna is withdrawn from the vial(s), added to 50 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection in a pvc bag or glass bottle for intravenous use and administered over 20 minutes. no other medicinal product can be infused concomitantly with introna. one dose of introna is given on each scheduled day. introna is given either daily (5 or 7 times a week), or three times a week, every other day, for example on monday, wednesday, and friday. interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this medicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. use introna exactly as prescribed by your doctor. do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take introna for as long as prescribed. if you use more introna than you should contact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. if you forget to use introna if you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking introna in combination with ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you are scheduled to inject this medicine every day, and you accidentally missed a full day's dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. contact your doctor or pharmacist if needed.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "introna", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

effects, although not everybody gets them. although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. psychiatric and central nervous system: some people get depressed when taking introna alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). some patients have actually committed suicide. be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. children and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with introna and ribavirin. immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency treatment if they display any unusual behavioural symptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. growth and development (children and adolescents): during the one year of treatment with introna in combination with ribavirin, some children and

happen, stop taking introna and tell your doctor immediately or go to the casualty department at your nearest hospital: - swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. these are all very serious side effects. if you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction to introna. you may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. these very serious side effects are very rare. check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: - chest pain or persistent and

pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or your eyesight or hearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or mucous membrane. these may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry iron and oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at 149 acceptable levels. moderate and usually reversible reduction in all three blood elements-white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, has been reported. at the beginning of treatment with introna, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors.

pneumonia. very rarely reported side effects: low blood pressure, puffy face, diabetes, leg cramps, back pain, kidney problems, nerve damage, bleeding gums, aplastic anaemia. pure red cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been reported. this causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy. very rarely sarcoidosis, (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported. loss of consciousness has occurred very rarely, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses. cases of stroke (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. check with your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. not known

the ears, brain and spinal cord), thoughts about threatening the life of others, mania (excessive or unreasonable enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and excitement), congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining of the heart) and the heart itself), pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs), and hepatitis b reactivation in hcv/hbv co-infected patients (recurrence of hepatitis b disease) have been reported with introna use. pulmonary arterial hypertension a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. this may occur in particular in patients with risk factors such as hiv infection or severe liver problems (cirrhosis). the side effect may develop at various time points during treatment, typically several months after starting treatment with introna. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects, you can also help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition":
