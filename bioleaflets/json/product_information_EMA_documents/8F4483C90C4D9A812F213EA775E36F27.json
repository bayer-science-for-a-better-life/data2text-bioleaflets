NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne ml of  concentrate for solution for infusion contains 1 mg of arsenic trioxide.  \n\nOne vial of 10 ml contains 10 mg of arsenic trioxide.  \n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion  \n\nSterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution, free from particles having a pH range of 7.7 – 8.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nArsenic trioxide is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: \n\n Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white \n blood cell count, ≤ 10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) \n\n Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)(Previous treatment should \n\n have included a retinoid and chemotherapy) \n\ncharacterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the  promyelocytic \n\nleukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. \n\n \n\nThe response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been \n\nexamined. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nArsenic trioxide must be administered under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the \n\nmanagement of acute leukaemias, and the special monitoring procedures described in section 4.4 must \n\nbe followed. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe same dose is recommended for adults and elderly. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n\n \n\nInduction treatment schedule \n\nArsenic trioxide must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, given daily until \n\ncomplete remission is achieved. If complete remission has not occurred by day 60, dosing must be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nConsolidation schedule \n\nArsenic trioxide must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 days per week. \n\nTreatment should be continued for 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 cycles. \n\n \n\nRelapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\nInduction treatment schedule \n\nArsenic trioxide must be administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day given daily \n\nuntil complete remission is achieved (less than 5% blasts present in cellular bone marrow with no \n\nevidence of leukaemic cells). If complete remission has not occurred by day 50, dosing must be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nConsolidation schedule \n\nConsolidation treatment must begin 3 to 4 weeks after completion of induction therapy. Arsenic \n\ntrioxide is to be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 25 doses given 5 days \n\nper week, followed by 2 days interruption, repeated for 5 weeks. \n\n \n\nDose delay, modification and reinitiation \n\n \n\nTreatment with arsenic trioxide must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of therapy \n\nat any time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity \n\nCriteria is observed and judged to be possibly related to Arsenic trioxide treatment. Patients who \n\nexperience such reactions that are considered arsenic trioxide related must resume treatment only \n\nafter resolution of the toxic event or after recovery to baseline status of the abnormality that \n\nprompted the interruption. In such cases, treatment must resume at 50% of the preceding daily dose. \n\nIf the toxic event does not recur within 7 days of restarting treatment at the reduced dose, the daily \n\ndose can be escalated back to 100% of the original dose. Patients who experience a recurrence of \n\ntoxicity must be removed from treatment. \n\nFor ECG, electrolytes abnormalities and hepatotoxicity see section 4.4.  \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \n\nduring the treatment with Arsenic trioxide, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic trioxide in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic \n\ntrioxide in patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Arsenic trioxide in children aged up to 17 years has not been established. \n\nCurrently available data for children aged 5 to 16 years are described in section 5.1 but no \n\nrecommendation on a posology can be made. No data are available for children under 5 years. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide must be administered intravenously over 1-2 hours. The infusion duration may be \n\nextended up to 4 hours if vasomotor reactions are observed. A central venous catheter is not required. \n\nPatients must be hospitalised at the beginning of treatment due to symptoms of disease and to ensure \n\nadequate monitoring. \n\nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nClinically unstable APL patients are especially at risk and will require more frequent monitoring of \n\nelectrolyte and glycaemia levels as well as more frequent haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \n\nparameter tests. \n\n \n\nLeukocyte activation syndrome (APL differentiation syndrome) \n\n27 % of patients with APL, in the relapsed/refractory setting, treated with arsenic trioxide have \n\nexperienced symptoms similar to a syndrome called the retinoic-acid-acute promyelocytic \n\nleukaemia (RA-APL) or APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight \n\ngain, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis. This \n\nsyndrome can be fatal. In newly diagnosed APL patients treated with arsenic trioxide and \n\nATRA, APL differentiation syndrome was observed in 19 % including \n5 severe cases. At the first signs that could suggest the syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnoea \n\nand/or weight gain, abnormal chest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities), treatment \n\nwith arsenic trioxide must be temporarily discontinued and high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg \n\nintravenously twice a day) must be immediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count and \n\ncontinued for at least 3 days or longer until signs and symptoms have abated. If clinically \n\njustified/required, concomitant diuretic therapy is also recommended. The majority of patients do not \n\nrequire permanent termination of arsenic trioxide therapy during treatment of the APL differentiation \n\nsyndrome. As soon as signs and symptoms have subsided, treatment with arsenic trioxide can be \n\nresumed at 50 % of the previous dose during the first 7 days. Thereafter, in the absence of worsening \n\nof the previous toxicity, arsenic trioxide might be resumed at full dosage. In the case of the \n\nreappearance of symptoms arsenic trioxide should be reduced to the previous dosage. In order to \n\nprevent the development of the APL differentiation syndrome during induction treatment, prednisone \n\n(0.5 mg/kg body weight per day throughout induction treatment) may be administered from day 1 of \n\narsenic trioxide application to the end of induction therapy in APL patients. It is recommended that \n\nchemotherapy not be added to treatment with steroids since there is no experience with \n\nadministration of both steroids and chemotherapy during treatment of the leukocyte activation \n\nsyndrome due to arsenic trioxide. Post-marketing experience suggests that a similar syndrome may \n\noccur in patients with other types of malignancy. Monitoring and management for these patients \n\nshould be as described above. \n\n \n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities \n\nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block. QT \n\nprolongation can lead to a torsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. \n\nPrevious treatment with anthracyclines may increase the risk of QT prolongation. The risk of torsade \n\nde pointes is related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging \n\nmedicinal products (such as class Ia and III antiarrythmics (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, \n\ndofetilide), antipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), some macrolides \n\n(e.g. erythromycin), some antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole), some quinolone \n\nantibiotics (e.g. sparfloxacin), and other individual medicinal products known to increase QT interval \n\n(e.g. cisapride)), a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, congestive \n\nheart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, amphotericin B or other conditions that \n\nresult in hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia. In clinical trials, in the relapsed/refractory setting, 40% \n\nof patients treated with arsenic trioxide experienced at least one QT corrected (QTc) interval \n\nprolongation greater than 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks \n\nafter arsenic trioxide infusion, and then returned to baseline by the end of 8 weeks after arsenic \n\ntrioxide infusion. One patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including \n\namphotericin B) had asymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL \n\nwith arsenic trioxide. In newly diagnosed APL patients 15.6 % showed QTc prolongation with \n\narsenic trioxide in combination with ATRA (see section 4.8). In one newly diagnosed patient \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\ninduction treatment was terminated because of severe prolongation of the QTc interval and \n\nelectrolyte abnormalities on day 3 of induction treatment. \n\n \n\nECG and electrolyte monitoring recommendations \n\nPrior to initiating therapy with arsenic trioxide, a 12-lead ECG must be performed and serum \n\nelectrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine must be assessed; preexisting \n\nelectrolyte abnormalities must be corrected and, if possible, medicinal products that are known to \n\nprolong the QT interval must be discontinued. Patients with risk factors of QTc prolongation or risk \n\nfactors of Torsade de pointes should be monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring (ECG). For \n\nQTc greater than 500 msec, corrective measures must be completed and the QTc reassessed with serial \n\nECGs and, if available, a specialist advice could be sought prior to considering using arsenic trioxide. \n\nDuring therapy with arsenic trioxide, potassium concentrations must be kept above 4 mEq/l and \n\nmagnesium concentrations must be kept above 1.8 mg/dl. Patients who reach an absolute QT interval \n\nvalue > 500 msec must be reassessed and immediate action must be taken to correct concomitant risk \n\nfactors, if any, while the risk/benefit of continuing versus suspending arsenic trioxide therapy must be \n\nconsidered. If syncope, rapid or irregular heartbeat develops, the patient must be hospitalised and \n\nmonitored continuously, serum electrolytes must be assessed, arsenic trioxide therapy must be \n\ntemporarily discontinued until the QTc interval regresses to below 460 msec, electrolyte abnormalities \n\nare corrected, and the syncope and irregular heartbeat cease. After recovery, treatment should be \n\nresumed at 50 % of the preceding daily dose. If QTc prolongation does not recur within 7 days of \n\nrestarting treatment at the reduced dose, treatment with arsenic trioxide can be resumed at 0.11 mg/kg \n\nbody weight per day for a second week. The daily dose can be escalated back to 100% of the original \n\ndose if no prolongation occurs. There are no data on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the QTc interval \n\nduring the infusion. Electrocardiograms must be obtained twice weekly, and more frequently for \n\nclinically unstable patients, during induction and consolidation. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity (grade 3 or greater) \n\nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2 % developed grade 3 or 4 \n\nhepatic toxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination \n\nwith ATRA (see section 4.8). However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of \n\neither arsenic trioxide, ATRA or both. Treatment with arsenic trioxide must be discontinued before \n\nthe scheduled end of therapy at any time that a hepatotoxicity grade 3 or greater on the National \n\nCancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria is observed. As soon as bilirubin and/or SGOT and/or \n\nalkaline phosphatase are decreased to below 4 times the normal upper level, treatment with arsenic \n\ntrioxide should be resumed at 50 % of the previous dose during the first 7 days. Thereafter, in \n\nabsence of worsening of the previous toxicity, arsenic trioxide should be resumed at full dosage. In \n\ncase of reappearance of hepatotoxicity, arsenic trioxide must be permanently discontinued. \n\n \n\nDose delay and modification \n\nTreatment with arsenic trioxide must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of therapy \n\nat any time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity \n\nCriteria is observed and judged to be possibly related to arsenic trioxide treatment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\nThe patient’s electrolyte and glycaemia levels, as well as haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \n\nparameter tests must be monitored at least twice weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable \n\npatients during the induction phase and at least weekly during the consolidation phase. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of \n\narsenic trioxide in patients with renal impairment. The experience in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required. \n\nThe use of arsenic trioxide in patients on dialysis has not been studied. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nduring the treatment with arsenic trioxide caution is advised in the use of arsenic trioxide in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 on hepatotoxicity and section 4.8). The experience in \n\npatients with severe hepatic impairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThere is limited clinical data on the use of arsenic trioxide in the elderly population. Caution is needed \n\nin these patients. \n\n \n\nHyperleukocytosis \nTreatment with arsenic trioxide has been associated with the development of hyperleukocytosis  \n(≥ 10 x 103/μl) in some relapsed/refractory APL patients. There did not appear to be a \nrelationship between baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts and development of \nhyperleukocytosis nor did there appear to be a correlation between baseline WBC count and peak \nWBC counts. Hyperleukocytosis was never treated with additional chemotherapy and resolved \non continuation of arsenic trioxide. WBC counts during consolidation were not as high as during \ninduction treatment and were < 10 x 103/μl, except in one patient who had a WBC count of 22 x \n103/μl during consolidation. Twenty relapsed/refractory APL patients (50 %) experienced \nleukocytosis; however, in all these patients, the WBC count was declining or had normalized by \nthe time of bone marrow remission and cytotoxic chemotherapy or leukopheresis was not \nrequired. In newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL leukocytosis developed \nduring induction therapy in 35 of 74 (47 %) patients (see section 4.8). However all cases were \nsuccessfully managed with hydroxyurea therapy. \n \n\nIn newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory APL patients who develop sustained leukocytosis after \n\ninitiation of therapy, hydroxyurea should be administered. Hydroxyurea should be continued at a \n\ngiven dose to keep the white blood cell count ≤ 10 x 103/μl and subsequently tapered. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommendation for initiation of hydroxyurea \n\n WBC  Hydroxyurea \n\n 10–50 x 10\n3\n\n/µl  500 mg four times a day \n\n > 50 x 10\n3\n\n/µl  1000 mg four times a day \n\n \n\nDevelopment of second primary malignancies \n\nThe active ingredient of Arsenic trioxide Accord, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor \n\npatients for the development of second primary malignancies. \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord contains sodium: \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\n“sodium-free”. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo formal assessments of pharmacokinetic interactions between arsenic trioxide and other therapeutic \n\nmedicinal products have been conducted. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation, hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia \n\n \n\nQT/QTc prolongation is expected during treatment with arsenic trioxide, and Torsade de pointes and \n\ncomplete heart block have been reported. Patients who are receiving, or who have received, medicinal \n\nproducts known to cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia, such as diuretics or amphotericin B, may \n\nbe at higher risk for torsade de pointes. Caution is advised when arsenic trioxide is coadministered \n\nwith other medicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation such as macrolide \n\nantibiotics, the antipsychotic thioridazine, or medicinal products known to cause hypokalemia or \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Additional information about QT prolonging medicinal agents is provided in \n\nSection 4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic effects \n\n \n\nHepatotoxic effects may occur during the treatment with arsenic trioxide, caution is advised when \n\narsenic trioxide is coadministered with other medicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic effects \n\n(see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nOther antileukaemic medicinal products \n\n \n\nThe influence of arsenic trioxide on the efficacy of other antileukaemic medicinal products is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential and men must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\narsenic trioxide. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n\nThere are no studies in pregnant women using arsenic trioxide. If this medicinal product is used during \n\npregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product, the patient must be informed \n\nof the potential harm to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nArsenic is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-\n\nfeeding infants from arsenic trioxide, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to and throughout \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo clinical or non-clinical fertility studies have been conducted with arsenic trioxide. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nArsenic trioxide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nRelated adverse reactions of CTC grade 3 and 4 occurred in 37% of relapsed/refractory APL \n\npatients in clinical trials. The most commonly reported reactions were hyperglycaemia, \n\nhypokalaemia, neutropenia, and increased alanine amino transferase (ALT). Leukocytosis occurred \n\nin 50% of patients with relapsed/refractory APL, as determined by haematology assessments. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions were common (1-10%) and not unexpected in the relapsed/refractory \n\npopulation. Those serious adverse reactions attributed to arsenic trioxide included APL differentiation \n\nsyndrome (3), leukocytosis (3), prolonged QT interval (4, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial \n\nfibrillation/atrial flutter (1), hyperglycaemia (2) and a variety of serious adverse reactions related to \n\nhaemorrhage, infections, pain, diarrhoea, nausea. \n\n \n\nIn general, treatment-emergent adverse events tended to decrease over time, in relapsed/refractory \n\nAPL patients perhaps accounted for by amelioration of the underlying disease process. Patients \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\ntended to tolerate consolidation and maintenance treatment with less toxicity than in induction. This \n\nis probably due to the confounding of adverse events by the uncontrolled disease process early on in \n\nthe treatment course and the myriad concomitant medicinal products required to control symptoms \n\nand morbidity. \n\n \n\nIn a phase 3, multicenter, noninferiority trial comparing all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) plus \n\nchemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk APL \n\npatients (Study APL0406; see also section 5.1), serious adverse reactions including hepatic toxicity, \n\nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia and QTc prolongation were observed in patients treated with arsenic \n\ntrioxide. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following undesirable effects have been reported in the APL0406 study in newly diagnosed \n\npatients and in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience in relapsed/refractory APL patients. \n\nUndesirable effects are listed in table 2 below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and \n\nfrequencies observed during arsenic trioxide clinical trials in 52 patients with refractory/relapsed \n\nAPL.

Twenty-seven patients had leukocytosis (WBC  10 x 103/l) during induction, 4 of \n\nwhom had values above 100,000/l. Baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts did not correlate with \n\ndevelopment of leukocytosis on study, and WBC counts during consolidation therapy were not as \n\nhigh as during induction. In these studies, leukocytosis was not treated with chemotherapeutic \n\nmedicinal products. Medicinal products that are used to lower the white blood cell count often \n\nexacerbate the toxicities associated with leukocytosis, and no standard approach has proven effective. \n\nOne patient treated under a compassionate use program died from cerebral infarct due to \n\nleukocytosis, following treatment with chemotherapeutic medicinal products to lower WBC count. \n\nObservation is the recommended approach with intervention only in selected cases. \n\n \n\nMortality in the pivotal studies in the relapsed setting from disseminated intravascular coagulation \n\n(DIC) associated haemorrhage was very common (> 10%), which is consistent with the early \n\nmortality reported in the literature. \n\n \n\nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, differentiation syndrome was \n\nobserved in 19 % including 5 severe cases. \n\n \n\nIn post authorisation experience, a differentiation syndrome, like retinoic acid syndrome, has also \n\nbeen reported for the treatment of malignancies other than APL with arsenic trioxide. \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation (see section 4.4). QT prolongation can lead to a \n\ntorsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. The risk of torsade de pointes is \n\nrelated to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \n\nproducts, a history of torsade de pointes, preexisting QT interval prolongation, congestive heart \n\nfailure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalaemia \n\nor hypomagnesaemia. One patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including \n\namphotericin B) had asymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL \n\nwith arsenic trioxide. She went onto consolidation without further evidence of QT prolongation. \n\n \n\nIn newly diagnosed patients, with low to intermediate risk APL, QTc prolongation was observed in \n\n15.6 %. In one patient induction treatment was terminated because of severe prolongation of the QTc \n\ninterval and electrolyte abnormalities on day 3. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nPeripheral neuropathy, characterised by paresthesia/dysesthesia, is a common and well known effect \n\nof environmental arsenic. Only 2 relapsed/refractory APL patients discontinued treatment early due \n\nto this adverse event and one went on to receive additional arsenic trioxide on a subsequent protocol. \n\n44% of relapsed/refractory APL patients experienced symptoms that could be associated with \n\nneuropathy; most were mild to moderate and were reversible upon cessation of treatment with \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\narsenic trioxide. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity (grade 3-4) \n\nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2 % developed grade 3 or 4 \n\nhepatic toxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination \n\nwith ATRA. However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either arsenic \n\ntrioxide, ATRA or both (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaematological and gastrointestinal toxicity \n\nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, gastrointestinal toxicity, grade 3-4 \n\nneutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred, however these were 2.2 times less frequent \n\nin patients treated with arsenic trioxide in combination with ATRA compared to patients treated with \n\nATRA + chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIf symptoms suggestive of serious acute arsenic toxicity (e.g. convulsions, muscle weakness and \n\nconfusion) appear, arsenic trioxide must be immediately discontinued and chelating therapy with \n\npenicillamine at a daily dose ≤ 1 gm per day may be considered. The duration of treatment with \n\npenicillamine must be evaluated taking into account the urinary arsenic laboratory values. For \n\npatients who cannot take oral medicinal product, dimercaprol administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg \n\nintramuscularly every 4 hours until any immediately life-threatening toxicity has subsided may be \n\nconsidered. Thereafter, penicillamine at a daily dose ≤ 1 gm per day may be given. In the presence of \n\ncoagulopathy, the oral administration of the chelating agent dimercaptosuccinic acid succimer (DCI) \n\n10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2 every 8 hours during 5 days and then every 12 hours during 2 weeks is \n\nrecommended. For patients with severe, acute arsenic overdose, dialysis should be considered. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX27 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes \n\nmorphological changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis \n\nin NB4 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or \n\ndegradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR alpha. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed non high risk APL patients \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide has been investigated in 77 newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk \n\nAPL, in a controlled, randomized, non-inferiority Phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and \n\nsafety of arsenic trioxide combined with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) with those of \n\nATRA+chemotherapy (eg, idarubicin and mitoxantrone) (Study APL0406). Patients with newly \n\ndiagnosed APL confirmed by the presence of t(15; 17) or PML-RAR alpha by RT-PCR or micro \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nspeckled PML nuclear distribution in leukemic cells were included. No data are available on patient \n\nwith variant translocations like t(11;17) (PLZF/RAR alpha). Patients with significant arrhythmias, \n\nEKG abnormalities (congenital long QT syndrome, history or presence of significant ventricular or \n\natrial tachyarrhythmia, clinically significant resting bradycardia (<50 beats per minute), QTc > 450 \n\nmsec on screening EKG, right bundle branch block plus left anterior hemiblock, bifascicular block) \n\nor neuropathy were excluded from the study. Patients in the ATRA+ arsenic trioxide treatment \n\ngroup received oral ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily and iv arsenic trioxide at 0.15 mg/kg daily until CR. \n\nDuring consolidation, ATRA was given at the same dose for periods of 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off \n\nfor a total of 7 courses, and arsenic trioxide was given at the same dose 5 days per week, 4 weeks on \n\nand 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 courses. Patients in the ATRA+chemotherapy treatment group \n\nreceived iv idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 and oral ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily until \n\nCR. During consolidation, patients received idarubicin at 5 mg/m2 on days 1 to 4 and ATRA at 45 \n\nmg/m2 daily for 15 days, then iv mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 and ATRA again at 45 \n\nmg/m2  daily for 15 days, and finally a single dose of idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 and ATRA at 45 \n\nmg/m2 daily for 15 days. Each course of consolidation was initiated at hematological recovery from \n\nthe previous course defined as absolute neutrophil count >1.5×109/L and platelets >100×109/L. \n\nPatients in the ATRA+chemotherapy treatment group also received maintenance treatment for up to \n\n2 years, consisting of oral 6-mercaptopurine at 50 mg/m2 daily, intramuscular methotrexate at 15 \n\nmg/m2 weekly, and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days every 3 months. \n\n \n\nThe key efficacy results are summarised in table 3 below: \n\n \n\nTable 3 \n\nEndpoint ATRA +  \n\nArsenic \n\ntrioxide \n\n(n = 77) \n\n[%] \n\nATRA +  \n\nChemotherapy \n\n(n = 79) \n\n[%] \n\nConfidence \n\ninterval (CI) \n\n \n\n \n\nP-value \n\n2-Year event-free \n\nsurvival (EFS) \n97 86 \n\n95 % CI for the \n\ndifference, 2-22 \n\npercentage \n\npoints \n\np<0.001 \n\nfor noninferiority \n\n \n\np = 0.02 \n\nfor superiority of \n\nATRA+Arsenic \n\ntrioxide \n\nHematologic \n\ncomplete remission \n\n(HCR) \n\n100 95  p = 0.12 \n\n2-Year overall \n\nsurvival (OS) \n99 91  p = 0.02 \n\n2-Year disease-free \n\nsurvival (DFS) \n97 90  p = 0.11 \n\n2-Year cumulative \n\nincidence of relapse \n\n(CIR) \n\n1 6  p = 0.24 \n\nAPL = acute promyelocytic leukemia; ATRA = all-trans-retinoic acid \n\n \n\nRelapsed/refractory APL \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide has been investigated in 52 APL patients, previously treated with an anthracycline \n\nand a retinoid regimen, in two open-label, single-arm, non-comparative studies. One was a single \n\ninvestigator clinical study (n=12) and the other was a multicentre, 9-institution study (n=40). \n\nPatients in the first study received a median dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day of arsenic trioxide (range 0.06 \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nto 0.20 mg/kg/day) and patients in the multicentre study received a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. \n\nArsenic trioxide was administered intravenously over 1 to 2 hours until the bone marrow was free of \n\nleukaemic cells, up to a maximum of 60 days. Patients with complete remission received \n\nconsolidation therapy with arsenic trioxide for 25 additional doses over a 5 weeks period. \n\nConsolidation therapy began 6 weeks (range, 3-8) after induction in the single institution study and \n\n4 weeks (range, 3-6) in the multicentre study. Complete remission (CR) was defined as the absence \n\nof visible leukaemic cells in the bone marrow and peripheral recovery of platelets and white blood \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nPatients in the single centre study had relapsed following 1-6 prior therapy regimens and 2 patients \n\nhad relapsed following stem cell transplantation. Patients in the multicentre study had relapsed \n\nfollowing 1-4 prior therapy regimens and 5 patients had relapsed following stem cell transplantation. \n\nThe median age in the single centre study was 33 years (age range 9 to 75). The median age in the \n\nmulticentre study was 40 years (age range 5 to 73). \n\n \n\nThe results are summarised in the table 4 below. \n\n \n\nTable 4 \n\n Single centre trial \n\nN=12 \n\nMulticentre trial \n\nN=40 \n\nArsenic trioxide dose, \n\nmg/kg/day (median, range) \n\n0.16 (0.06 – 0.20) 0.15 \n\nComplete remission 11 (92%) 34 (85%) \n\nTime to bone marrow \n\nremission (median) \n\n32 days 35 days \n\nTime to CR (median) 54 days 59 days \n\n18-Month survival 67% 66% \n\n \n\nThe single institution study included 2 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), both of whom achieved \n\nCR.

Three patients \n\nfrom the single institution study and 15 patients from the multicentre study had stem cell transplants \n\nafter completing arsenic trioxide. The Kaplan-Meier median CR duration for the single institution \n\nstudy is 14 months and has not been reached for the multicentre study. At last follow-up, 6 of 12 \n\npatients in the single institution study were alive with a median follow-up time of 28 months (range \n\n25 to 29). In the multicentre study 27 of 40 patients were alive with a median follow-up time of 16 \n\nmonths (range 9 to 25).

The response rate was \n\nsimilar for both genders. There is no experience on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the variant APL \n\ncontaining the t(11;17) and t(5;17) chromosomal translocations. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe experience in children is limited. Of 7 patients less than 18 years of age (range 5 to 16 years) \n\ntreated with arsenic trioxide at the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 patients achieved a \n\ncomplete response (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe inorganic, lyophilized form of arsenic trioxide, when placed into solution, immediately forms the \nhydrolysis product arsenious acid (AsIII). AsIII is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic \ntrioxide. \n\n \nDistribution \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution (Vd) for As\nIII \n\nis large (>400 L) indicating significant distribution into the \n\ntissues with negligible protein binding. Vd is also weight dependent, increasing with increasing \n\nbody weight. Total arsenic accumulates mainly in the liver, kidney, and heart and, to a lesser extent, \nin the lung, hair, and nails. \n\n \nBiotransformation \nThe metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves oxidation of arsenious acid (AsIII), the active species of \narsenic trioxide, to arsenic acid (AsV), as well as oxidative methylation to monomethylarsonic acid \n(MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) by methyltransferases, primarily in the liver. The \npentavalent metabolites, MMAV and DMAV, are slow to appear in plasma (approximately 10-24 \nhours after first administration of arsenic trioxide), but due to their longer half-life, accumulate more \nupon multiple dosing than does AsIII. The extent of accumulation of these metabolites is dependent \non the dosing regimen. Approximate accumulation ranged from 1.4- to 8-fold following multiple as \ncompared to single dose administration. AsV  is present in plasma only at relatively low levels. \n \n\nIn vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes revealed that arsenic trioxide has no \n\ninhibitory activity on substrates of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, \n\n2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, 4A9/11. Substances that are substrates for these P450 enzymes are not \n\nexpected to interact with arsenic trioxide. \n\n \nElimination \nApproximately 15% of the administered arsenic trioxide dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nAsIII. The methylated metabolites of AsIII (MMAV, DMAV) are primarily excreted in the urine. The \nplasma concentration of AsIII declines from peak plasma concentration in a biphasic manner with a \nmean terminal elimination half-life of 10 to 14 hours. The total clearance of AsIII over the single-\ndose range of 7-32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg) is 49 L/h and the renal clearance is 9 L/h. \nClearance is not dependent on the weight of the subject or the dose administered over the dose range \nstudied. The mean estimated terminal elimination half-lives of the metabolites MMAV and DMAV \nare 32 hours and 70 hours, respectively. \n\n \nRenal impairment \nPlasma clearance of AsIII was not altered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance of 50-80 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-49 mL/min). \nThe plasma clearance of AsIII in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \nthan 30 mL/min) was 40% lower when compared with patients with normal renal function (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to MMAV and DMAV tended to be larger in patients with renal impairment; the \n\nclinical consequence of this is unknown but no increased toxicity was noted. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma having mild to moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment indicate that AsIII or AsV do not accumulate following twice-weekly infusions. No clear \ntrend toward an increase in systemic exposure to AsIII, AsV, MMAV or DMAV was observed with \ndecreasing level of hepatic function as assessed by dose-normalized (per mg dose) AUC. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nIn the total single dose range of 7 to 32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg), systemic exposure (AUC) \nappears to be linear. The decline from peak plasma concentration of AsIII occurs in a biphasic \nmanner and is characterized by an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower terminal \nelimination phase. After administration at 0.15 mg/kg on a daily (n=6) or twice-weekly (n=3) \nregimen, an approximate 2-fold accumulation of AsIII was observed as compared to a single \ninfusion. This accumulation was slightly more than expected based on single-dose results. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nLimited reproductive toxicity studies of arsenic trioxide in animals indicate embryotoxicity and \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nteratogenicity (neural tube defects, anophthalmia and microphthalmia) at administration of 1-10 \n\ntimes the recommended clinical dose (mg/m2). Fertility studies have not been conducted with arsenic \n\ntrioxide. Arsenic compounds induce chromosomal aberrations and morphological transformations of \n\nmammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. No formal carcinogenicity studies of arsenic trioxide have been \n\nperformed. However, arsenic trioxide and other inorganic arsenic compounds are recognised as \n\nhuman carcinogens. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n \n\n1. What Arsenic trioxide Accord is and what it is used for \n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord contains arsenic trioxide which is an anticancer medicine. It is used in adult \n\npatients with newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), and in \n\nadult patients, whose disease has not responded to other therapies. APL is a unique type of myeloid \n\nleukaemia, a disease in which abnormal white blood cells and abnormal bleeding and bruising occur. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Arsenic trioxide Accord \n \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord must be given under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of acute leukaemias. \n\n \n\nDo not use Arsenic trioxide Accord \nIf you are allergic to arsenic trioxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nYou must talk to your doctor or nurse before using Arsenic trioxide Accord, if \n\n- you have impaired kidney function. \n- you have any liver problems. \n \n\nYour doctor will take the following precautions: \n\n- Tests will be performed to check the amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium and creatinine \nin your blood before your first dose of Arsenic trioxide Accord. \n\n- You should have an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram ECG) performed before \n your first dose. \n\n- Blood tests (potassium, calcium, magnesium and liver function) should be repeated during your \ntreatment with  Arsenic trioxide Accord. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n- In addition, you will receive electrocardiograms twice weekly. \n\n- If you are at risk for a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. torsade de pointes or QTc \n\n prolongation), your heart will be monitored continuously. \n\n- Your doctor may monitor your health during and after treatment, since arsenic trioxide, the \n\n active substance in Arsenic trioxide Accord, may cause other cancers. You should report any \n\nnew and exceptional symptoms and circumstances whenever you see your doctor. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Arsenic trioxide Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nIn particular tell your doctor \n\n- if you are taking any of various types of medicines which could cause a change in the rhythm of \n\nyour heartbeat. These include: \n\n some types of antiarrhythmics (medicines used to correct irregular heart beats, e.g. \n\nquinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) \n\n medicines to treat psychosis (loss of contact with reality, e.g. thioridazine) \n\n medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline) \n\n some types of medicines to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin and sparfloxacin) \n\n some medicines to treat allergies such as hayfever, called antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine \n\nand astemizole) \n\n any medicines that cause a decrease in magnesium or potassium in your blood (e.g. \n\namphotericin B) \n\n cisapride (a medicine used to relieve certain stomach problems). \n\nThe effect of these medicines on your heartbeat can be made worse by Arsenic trioxide Accord. \n\nYou must be sure to tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking. \n\n- if you are taking or have recently taken any medicine which may affect your liver. If you are \n\nnot sure, show the bottle or pack to your doctor. \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your food or drink while you are receiving Arsenic trioxide Accord. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord may cause harm to the foetus when used by pregnant women. \n\nIf you are able to become pregnant, you must use effective birth control during treatment with Arsenic \n\ntrioxide Accord. \n\nIf you are pregnant or you become pregnant during the treatment with Arsenic trioxide Accord, you \n\nmust ask your doctor for advice. \n\nMen should also use effective contraception during treatment with Arsenic trioxide Accord.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. The arsenic in Arsenic trioxide \n\nAccord passes into breast milk. \n\nBecause Arsenic trioxide Accord can harm nursing infants, do not breast-feed while on Arsenic \n\ntrioxide Accord. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord is expected to have no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and \n\nuse machines. If you experience discomfort or if you feel unwell after a Arsenic trioxide Accord \n\ninjection, you should wait until the symptoms go away before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord contains sodium \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-\n\nfree”. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Arsenic trioxide Accord \n \n\nDuration and frequency of treatment \n\n \n\nPatients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia \n\nYour doctor will give you Arsenic trioxide Accord once every day as an infusion. In your first \n\ntreatment cycle, you may be treated every day up to 60 days at most or until your doctor determines \n\nthat your disease is better. If your disease responds to Arsenic trioxide Accord, you will be given 4 \n\nadditional treatment cycles of 20 doses given 5 days per week (followed by 2 days interruption) for \n\n4 weeks followed by 4 weeks interruption. Your doctor will decide exactly how long you must \n\ncontinue on therapy with Arsenic trioxide Accord. \n\n \n\nPatients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, whose disease has not responded to other therapies \n\nYour doctor will give you Arsenic trioxide Accord once every day as an infusion. In your first \n\ntreatment cycle, you may be treated every day up to 50 days at most or until your doctor determines \n\nthat your disease is better. If your disease responds to Arsenic trioxide Accord, you will be given a \n\nsecond treatment cycle of 25 doses given 5 days per week (followed by 2 days interruption) for 5 \n\nweeks. Your doctor will decide exactly how long you must continue on therapy with Arsenic trioxide \n\nAccord. \n\n \n\nMethod and route of administration \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord must be diluted with a solution containing glucose or a solution containing \n\nsodium chloride. \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord is normally given by a doctor or a nurse. It is given as a drip (infusion) into a \n\nvein over 1-2 hours, but the infusion may last longer if side effects like flushing and dizziness occur. \n\n \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord must not be mixed with, or infused through the same tube with other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIf your doctor gives you more Arsenic trioxide Accord than he/she should \nYou may experience convulsions, muscle weakness and confusion. If this happens, treatment with \n\nArsenic trioxide Accord must be stopped immediately and your doctor will treat the arsenic overdose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice the following side effects, as these may be \n\nsigns of a severe condition called “differentiation syndrome”, which might be fatal: \n\n- difficulty in breathing \n- coughing \n- chest pain \n- fever \n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice one or more of the following side effects, as \n\nthese may be signs of allergic reaction: \n\n- difficulty in breathing \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n- fever \n- sudden weight gain \n- water retention \n- fainting \n- palpitations (strong heartbeat you can feel in your chest) \n\n \n\nWhile on treatment with Arsenic trioxide Accord, you may experience some of the following \n\nreactions: \n\n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n- fatigue (weariness), pain, fever, headache \n- nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea \n- dizziness, muscle pain, numbness or tingling \n- rash or itching, increased blood sugar, oedema (swelling due to excess fluid) \n- shortness of breath, fast heart beat, abnormal ECG heart tracing \n- reduced potassium or magnesium in the blood, liver function tests abnormal including \n presence of excess bilirubin or gamma-glutamyltransferase in the blood \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n- reduction in blood cell counts (platelets, red and/or white blood cells), increased white \n blood cells \n\n- chills, increased weight \n- a fever due to an infection and low levels of white blood cells, herpes zoster infection \n- chest pain, bleeding in the lung, hypoxia (low oxygen level), collection of fluid around the \n heart  or the lung, low blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm \n\n- fit, joint or bone pain, inflammation of the blood vessels \n- increased sodium or magnesium, ketones in the blood and urine (ketoacidosis), renal \n\n function tests abnormal, kidney failure \n\n- stomach (abdominal) ache \n- redness of the skin, swollen face, blurred vision \n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\n- lung infection, infection in the blood \n- inflammation of the lungs which causes chest pain and breathlessness, cardiac failure \n- dehydration, confusion \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.
