NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nEMADINE 0.5 mg/ml, eye drops, solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\n1 ml of solution contains emedastine 0.5 mg (as difumarate) \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride 0.1 mg/ml \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nEye drops, solution. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nSymptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nEMADINE has not been studied in clinical trials beyond six weeks. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe dose is one drop of EMADINE to be applied to the affected eye(s) twice daily. \n\n \n\nWhen used with other ophthalmic medicines, an interval of ten minutes should be allowed between \n\napplications of each medicinal product. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nEMADINE has not been studied in elderly patients older than 65 years, and therefore its use is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nEMADINE may be used in paediatric patients (3 years of age and older) at the same posology as in \n\nadults. \n\n \n\nHepatic and Renal impairment Use \n\nEMADINE has not been studied in these patients and therefore, its use is not recommended in this \n\npopulation. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nTo prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch the \n\neyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. \n\n \n\nAfter cap is removed, if tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove before using product. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nOcular corneal infiltrates \n\n \n\nOcular corneal infiltrates were reported in conjunction with the use of EMADINE. In case of corneal \n\ninfiltrates, the product should be discontinued and appropriate management should be implemented. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been \n\nreported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since EMADINE contains \n\nbenzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use. \n\n \n\nIn addition benzalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact \n\nlenses. Contact with soft contact lenses is to be avoided. Patients must be instructed to remove contact \n\nlenses prior to the application of EMADINE and wait 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before \n\nreinsertion. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of emedastine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Nevertheless, \n\nconsidering the absence of effects of emedastine on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors, \n\nEMADINE can be used during pregnancy if the dosage recommendation in section 4.2 is respected. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nEmedastine has been identified in the milk of rats following oral administration. It is not known \n\nwhether topical administration to humans could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce \n\ndetectable quantities in breast milk. Caution should be exercised if EMADINE is administered during \n\nbreast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown no evidence of impaired fertility (See Section 5.3). No human fertility \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nEMADINE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines, however as with \n\nany ocular medication, if transient blurred vision or other visual disturbance occurs at instillation, the \n\npatient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \n\nIn 13 clinical studies involving 696 patients, Emadine was administered one to four times daily in both \n\neyes for up to 42 days. In clinical trials, approximately 7% of patients experienced an adverse drug \n\nreaction associated with the use of Emadine; however, less than 1% of these patients discontinued \n\ntherapy due to these adverse drug reactions. No serious ophthalmic or systemic adverse drug reactions \n\nwere reported in the clinical trials. The most common adverse drug reactions were eye pain and eye \n\npruritus occurring in 1% to 2.0% of patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions listed below were observed in clinical studies or with post marketing \n\nexperience. They are ranked according to system organ class and classified according to the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of \n\nseriousness. \n\n \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClassification \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon abnormal dreams \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon headache, sinus \n\nheadache, dysgeusia \n\nEye disorders Common eye pain, eye \n\npruritus, conjunctival \n\nhyperaemia \n\nUncommon corneal infiltrates, \n\ncorneal staining, \n\nblurred vision, eye \n\nirritation, dry eye, \n\nforeign body \n\nsensation in eyes, \n\nlacrimation \n\nincreased, \n\nasthenopia, ocular \n\nhyperaemia \n\nCardiac disorders Not known tachycardia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon rash \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo specific reactions are to be expected with an ocular overdose of the product. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in humans regarding overdose by accidental or deliberate ingestion. In case of \n\naccidental ingestion of the content of a bottle of EMADINE, sedative effects may occur and the \n\npotential of emedastine to increase the QT interval should be borne in mind and appropriate \n\nmonitoring and management should be implemented. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: decongestants and antiallergics; other antiallergics, ATC code: S01G X \n\n06 \n\n \n\nEmedastine is a potent selective and topically effective histamine H1 antagonist (Ki = 1.3 nM). In vitro \n\nexaminations of emedastine’s affinity for histamine receptors (H1, H2, and H3) demonstrate \n\n10,000-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor, Ki’s = 1.3 nM, 49,064 nM and 12, 430 nM, respectively. In \n\nvivo topical ocular administration of emedastine produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of \n\nhistamine-stimulated conjunctival vascular permeability. Studies with emedastine have not shown \n\neffects on adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonin receptors. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nEmedastine is absorbed systemically, as are other topically administered drug substances. In a study \n\ninvolving ten normal volunteers dosed bilaterally twice daily for 15 days with EMADINE 0.5 mg/ml \n\neye drops solution, plasma concentrations of the parent compound were generally below the \n\nquantitation limit of the assay (0.3 ng/ml). Samples in which emedastine was quantifiable ranged from \n\n0.30 to 0.49 ng/ml. \n\n \n\nThe human oral bioavailability of emedastine is approximately 50% and maximum plasma \n\nconcentrations were achieved within one-two hours after dosing. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEmedastine is principally metabolised by the liver. The elimination half-life of topical emedastine is \n\nten hours. Approximately 44% of an oral dose is recovered in the urine over 24 hours, with only \n\n3.6% of the dose excreted as parent drug substance. Two primary metabolites, 5-and \n\n6-hydroxyemedastine, are excreted in the urine as both free and conjugated forms. The 5-oxo \n\nanalogues of 5-and 6-hydroxyemedastine and the N-oxide are also formed as minor metabolites. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical Safety Data \n\n \n\nEmedastine difumarate demonstrated low acute toxicity in a number of species by various routes of \n\nadministration. No clinically significant local or systemic effects were observed in long-term topical \n\nocular studies in rabbits. \n\n \n\nCorneal limbal mononuclear cell infiltrates were noted in 1/4 male monkeys treated with 0.5 mg/ml \n\nand in 4/4 males and 1/4 females treated with1.0 mg/ml. Scleral mononuclear cell infiltrates were \n\npresent in 1/4 males and 1/4 females treated with 0.5 mg/ml and in 2/4 males and 1/4 females treated \n\nwith1.0 mg/ml. Mean peak plasma levels were approximately 1 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml for the 0.5 and \n\n1.0 mg/ml treatments respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEmedastine was found to increase the QT interval in dogs; the NOEL corresponds to levels 23-fold \n\nhigher than those found in patients (7 ng/ml as compared with 0.3 ng/ml, i.e., the limit of detection for \n\nemedastine). \n\n \n\nEmedastine difumarate was not found to be carcinogenic in studies in mice and rats. Emedastine \n\ndifumarate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. \n\n \n\nIn a teratology study in rats, foetotoxic but not teratogenic effects were observed at the highest dose \n\nevaluated (140 mg/kg/day); no effects were observed at a lower level (40 mg/kg/day) which \n\ncorresponds to an exposure well in excess of that produced by the therapeutic recommended dose. No \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed in a study in rabbits. \n\n \n\nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility or decreased reproductive capacity in rats administered \n\noral dosages of Emedastine difumarate of up to 30 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Any unused solution should be \n\ndiscarded immediately after use. \n\n \n\nElderly Population \n\nEMADINE has not been studied in elderly patients older than 65 years, and therefore its use is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Population \n\nEMADINE may be used in paediatric patients (3 years of age and older) at the same posology as in \n\nadults. \n\n \n\nHepatic and Renal impairment Use \n\nEMADINE has not been studied in these patients and therefore, its use is not recommended in this \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nOcular corneal infiltrates \n\n \n\nOcular corneal infiltrates were reported in conjunction with the use of EMADINE. In case of corneal \n\ninfiltrates, the product should be discontinued and appropriate management should be implemented. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of emedastine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Nevertheless, \n\nconsidering the absence of effects of emedastine on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors, \n\nEMADINE can be used during pregnancy if the dosage recommendation in section 4.2 is respected. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nEmedastine has been identified in the milk of rats following oral administration. It is not known \n\nwhether topical administration to humans could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce \n\ndetectable quantities in breast milk. Caution should be exercised if EMADINE is administered during \n\nbreast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown no evidence of impaired fertility (See Section 5.3). No human fertility \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nEMADINE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines, however as with \n\nany ocular medication, if transient blurred vision or other visual disturbance occurs at instillation, the \n\npatient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \n\nIn 13 clinical studies involving 696 patients, Emadine was administered one to four times daily in both \n\neyes for up to 42 days. In clinical trials, approximately 7% of patients experienced an adverse drug \n\nreaction associated with the use of Emadine; however, less than 1% of these patients discontinued \n\ntherapy due to these adverse drug reactions. No serious ophthalmic or systemic adverse drug reactions \n\nwere reported in the clinical trials. The most common adverse drug reactions were eye pain and eye \n\npruritus, occurring in 1% to of 2.0% of patients. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions listed below were observed in clinical studies or with post marketing \n\nexperience. They are ranked according to system organ class and classified according to the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of \n\nseriousness. \n\n \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClassification \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon abnormal dreams \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon headache, sinus \n\nheadache, dysgeusia \n\nEye disorders Common eye pain, eye \n\npruritus, conjunctival \n\nhyperaemia \n\nUncommon corneal infiltrates, \n\ncorneal staining, \n\nblurred vision, eye \n\nirritation, dry eye \n\nforeign body \n\nsensation in eyes, \n\nlacrimation \n\nincreased, \n\nasthenopia, ocular \n\nhyperaemia \n\nCardiac disorders Not known tachycardia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon rash \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo specific reactions are to be expected with an ocular overdose of the product. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in humans regarding overdose by accidental or deliberate ingestion. In case of \n\nthe deliberate ingestion of the contents of many unit doses of EMADINE, sedative effects may occur \n\nand the potential of emedastine to increase the QT interval should be borne in mind and appropriate \n\nmonitoring and management should be implemented. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: decongestants and antiallergics; other antiallergics. ATC code: \n\nS01G X 06. \n\n \n\nEmedastine is a potent selective and topically effective histamine H1 antagonist (Ki = 1.3 nM). In vitro \n\nexaminations of emedastine’s affinity for histamine receptors (H1, H2, and H3) demonstrate \n\n10,000-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor, Kis = 1.3 nM, 49,064 nM and 12, 430 nM, respectively. In \n\nvivo topical ocular administration of emedastine produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of \n\nhistamine-stimulated conjunctival vascular permeability. Studies with emedastine have not shown \n\neffects on adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonin receptors. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nEmedastine is absorbed systemically, as are other topically administered drug substances. In a study \n\ninvolving ten normal volunteers dosed bilaterally twice daily for 15 days with EMADINE 0.5 mg/ml \n\neye drops, solution, plasma concentrations of the parent compound were generally below the \n\nquantitation limit of the assay (0.3 ng/ml). Samples in which emedastine was quantifiable ranged from \n\n0.30 to 0.49 ng/ml. \n\n \n\nThe human oral bioavailability of emedastine is approximately 50% and maximum plasma \n\nconcentrations were achieved within one-two hours after dosing. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEmedastine is principally metabolised by the liver. The elimination half-life of topical emedastine is \n\nten hours. Approximately 44% of an oral dose is recovered in the urine over 24 hours, with only 3.6% \n\nof the dose excreted as parent drug substance. Two primary metabolites, 5-and 6-hydroxyemedastine, \n\nare excreted in the urine as both free and conjugated forms. The 5-oxo analogues of 5-and \n\n6-hydroxyemedastine and the N-oxide are also formed as minor metabolites. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical Safety Data \n\n \n\nEmedastine difumarate demonstrated low acute toxicity in a number of species by various routes of \n\nadministration. No clinically significant local or systemic effects were observed in long-term topical \n\nocular studies in rabbits. \n\n \n\nCorneal limbal mononuclear cell infiltrates were noted in 1/4 male monkeys treated with 0.5 mg/ml \n\nand in 4/4 males and 1/4 females treated with 1.0 mg/ml. Scleral mononuclear cell infiltrates were \n\npresent in 1/4 males and 1/4 females treated with 0.5 mg/ml and in 2/4 males and 1/4 females treated \n\nwith 1.0 mg/ml. Mean peak plasma levels were approximately 1 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml for the 0.5 and \n\n1.0 mg/ml treatments respectively. \n\n \n\nEmedastine was found to increase the QT interval in dogs; the NOEL corresponds to levels 23 fold \n\nhigher than those found in patients (7 ng/ml as compared with 0.3 ng/ml, i.e., the limit of detection for \n\nemedastine). \n\n \n\nEmedastine difumarate was not found to be carcinogenic in studies in mice and rats. Emedastine \n\ndifumarate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nIn a teratology study in rats, foetotoxic but not teratogenic effects were observed at the highest dose \n\nevaluated (140 mg/kg/day); no effects were observed at a lower level (40 mg/kg/day) which \n\ncorresponds to an exposure well in excess of that produced by the therapeutic recommended dose. No \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed in a study in rabbits. \n\n \n\nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility or decreased reproductive capacity in rats administered \n\noral dosages of Emedastine difumarate of up to 30 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Do not use a double dose to make up for the one missed. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drops, leave at least 10 minutes between using EMADINE and the other \n\ndrops.
