NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOSSEOR 2 g granules for oral suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sachet contains 2 g of strontium ranelate.  \n \nExcipient with known effect:  \nEach sachet also contains 20 mg of aspartame (E951). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules for oral suspension \nYellow granules \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of severe osteoporosis: \n\n- in postmenopausal women, \n- in adult men, \n\nat high risk of fracture, for whom treatment with other medicinal products approved for the \ntreatment of osteoporosis is not possible due to, for example, contraindications or intolerance. In \npostmenopausal women, strontium ranelate reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures (see \nsection 5.1). \nThe decision to prescribe strontium ranelate should be based on an assessment of the individual \npatient's overall risks (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated by a physician with experience in the treatment of osteoporosis. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one 2 g sachet once daily by oral administration. \n \nDue to the nature of the treated disease, strontium ranelate is intended for long-term use. \n \nThe absorption of strontium ranelate is reduced by food, milk and derivative products and therefore, \nOSSEOR should be administered in-between meals. Given the slow absorption, OSSEOR should be \ntaken at bedtime, preferably at least two hours after eating (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nPatients treated with strontium ranelate should receive vitamin D and calcium supplements if dietary \nintake is inadequate. \n \nElderly  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate have been established in a broad age range (up to \n100 years at inclusion) of adult men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. No dose \nadjustment is required in relation to age. \n \nRenal impairment \nStrontium ranelate is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance below 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is required in patients \nwith mild-to-moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/min creatinine clearance) (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment(see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of OSSEOR in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \nThe granules in the sachets must be taken as a suspension in a glass containing a minimum of 30 ml \n(approximately one third of a standard glass) of water.  \nAlthough in-use studies have demonstrated that strontium ranelate is stable in suspension for \n24 hours after preparation, the suspension should be drunk immediately after being prepared. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Current or previous venous thromboembolic events (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and \npulmonary embolism. \n- Temporary or permanent immobilisation due to e.g. post-surgical recovery or prolonged bed rest.  \n- Established, current or past history of ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and/or \ncerebrovascular disease. \n- Uncontrolled hypertension.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCardiac ischaemic events \nIn pooled randomised placebo-controlled studies of post-menopausal osteoporotic patients, a \nsignificant increase in myocardial infarction has been observed in OSSEOR treated patients \ncompared to placebo (see section 4.8). \nBefore starting treatment, patients should be evaluated with respect to cardiovascular risk. \nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with strontium ranelate after careful \nconsideration (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \nDuring OSSEOR treatment, these cardiovascular risks should be monitored on a regular basis \ngenerally every 6 to 12 months. \nTreatment should be stopped if the patient develops ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial \ndisease, cerebrovascular disease or if hypertension is uncontrolled (see section 4.3). \n \nVenous thromboembolism \nIn phase III placebo-controlled studies, strontium ranelate treatment was associated with an increase \nin the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (see \nsection 4.8). The cause of this finding is unknown. OSSEOR is contra-indicated in patients with a \npast history of venous thromboembolic events (see section 4.3) and should be used with caution in \npatients at risk of VTE. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nWhen treating patients over 80 years at risk of VTE, the need for continued treatment with OSSEOR \nshould be re-evaluated.  \nOSSEOR should be discontinued as soon as possible in the event of an illness or a condition leading \nto immobilisation (see section 4.3) and adequate preventive measures taken. Therapy should not be \nrestarted until the initiating condition has resolved and the patient is fully mobile. When a VTE \noccurs, OSSEOR should be stopped. \n \nUse in patients with renal impairment \nIn the absence of bone safety data in patients with severe renal impairment treated with strontium \nranelate, OSSEOR is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min (see \nsection 5.2). In accordance with good medical practice, periodic assessment of renal function is \nrecommended in patients with chronic renal impairment. Continuation of treatment with OSSEOR in \npatients developing severe renal impairment should be considered on an individual basis. \n \nSkin reactions \nLife-threatening cutaneous reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN) and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)) have been reported with \nthe use of OSSEOR. \nPatients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. The \nhighest risk for occurrence of SJS or TEN is within the first weeks of treatment and usually around  \n3-6 weeks for DRESS  \nIf symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN (e.g. progressive skin rash often with blisters or mucosal \nlesions) or DRESS (e.g.  rash, fever, eosinophilia and systemic involvement (e.g. adenopathy, \nhepatitis, interstitial nephropathy, interstitial lung disease) are present, OSSEOR treatment should \nbe discontinued immediately.  \nThe best results in managing SJS, TEN or DRESS come from early diagnosis and immediate \ndiscontinuation of any suspect drug. Early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis.   The \noutcome of DRESS is favorable in most cases upon discontinuation of OSSEOR and after initiation \nof corticosteroid therapy when necessary. Recovery could be slow and recurrences of the syndrome \nhave been reported in some cases after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. \nIf the patient has developed SJS, TEN or DRESS with the use of OSSEOR, OSSEOR must not be \nre-started in this patient at any time. \nA higher incidence, although still rare, of hypersensitivity reactions including skin rash, SJS or TEN \nin patients of Asian origin has been reported (see section 4.8). \nHLA-A*33:03 and HLA-B*58:01 alleles have been identified as potential genetic risk factors for \nstrontium ranelate-associated SJS/TEN in Han Chinese patients from a retrospective, case-control, \npharmacogenetic study. Where possible, screening for HLA-A*33:03 and HLA-B*58:01 alleles \ncould be considered before starting treatment with OSSEOR in patients of Han Chinese origin. If \ntests are positive for one or both alleles, OSSEOR should not be started. However, absence of these \nalleles upon genotyping does not exclude that SJS/TEN can still occur.   \n \nInteraction with laboratory test \nStrontium interferes with colorimetric methods for the determination of blood and urinary calcium \nconcentrations. Therefore, in medical practice, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission \nspectrometry or atomic absorption spectrometry methods should be used to ensure an accurate \nassessment of blood and urinary calcium concentrations. \n \nExcipient \nOSSEOR contains aspartame,  a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with \nphenylketonuria.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nFood, milk and derivative products, and medicinal products containing calcium may reduce the \nbioavailability of strontium ranelate by approximately 60-70%. Therefore, administration of \nOSSEOR and such products should be separated by at least two hours (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nAs divalent cations can form complexes with oral tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline) and quinolone \nantibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) at the gastro-intestinal level and thereby reduce their absorption, \nsimultaneous administration of strontium ranelate with these medicinal products is not \nrecommended. As a precautionary measure, OSSEOR treatment should be suspended during \ntreatment with oral tetracycline or quinolone antibiotics. \n \nAn in vivo clinical interaction study showed that the administration of aluminium and magnesium \nhydroxides either two hours before or together with strontium ranelate caused a slight decrease in \nthe absorption of strontium ranelate (20-25% AUC decrease), while absorption was almost \nunaffected when the antacid was given two hours after strontium ranelate. It is therefore preferable \nto take antacids at least two hours after OSSEOR. However, when this dosing regimen is impractical \ndue to the recommended administration of OSSEOR at bedtime, concomitant intake remains \nacceptable. \n \nNo interaction was observed with oral supplementation of vitamin D. \n \nNo evidence of clinical interactions or relevant increase of blood strontium levels with medicinal \nproducts expected to be commonly prescribed concomitantly with OSSEOR in the target population \nwere found during clinical trials. These included: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (including \nacetylsalicylic acid), anilides (such as paracetamol), H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, \ndiuretics, digoxin and cardiac glycosides, organic nitrates and other vasodilators for cardiac \ndiseases, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, \nselective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists, oral anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, statins, \nfibrates and benzodiazepine derivatives. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nThere are no data from the use of strontium ranelate in pregnant women. \n At high doses, animal studies have shown reversible bone effects in the offspring of rats and rabbits \ntreated during pregnancy (see section 5.3). If OSSEOR is used inadvertently during pregnancy, \ntreatment must be stopped. \n \nBreast-feeding \nPhysico-chemical data suggest excretion of Strontium ranelate in human milk OSSEOR should not \nbe used during breast-feeding \n \nFertility  \nNo effects were observed on males and females fertility in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nStrontium ranelate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nOSSEOR has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 8,000 participants. Long-term safety has \nbeen evaluated in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated for up to 60 months with \nstrontium ranelate 2 g/day (n=3,352) or placebo (n=3,317) in phase III studies.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for the treatment of bone diseases - Other drugs affecting bone \nstructure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX03. \n \nMechanism of action \nIn vitro, strontium ranelate: \n- increases bone formation in bone tissue culture as well as osteoblast precursor replication and \n\ncollagen synthesis in bone cell culture. \n- reduces bone resorption by decreasing osteoclast differentiation and resorbing activity. \nThis results in a rebalance of bone turnover in favour of bone formation. \n \nThe activity of strontium ranelate was studied in various non-clinical models. In particular, in intact \nrats, strontium ranelate increases trabecular bone mass, trabeculae number and thickness; this results \nin an improvement of bone strength. \n \nIn bone tissue of treated animals and humans, strontium is mainly adsorbed onto the crystal surface \nand only slightly substitutes for calcium in the apatite crystal of newly formed bone. Strontium \nranelate does not modify the bone crystal characteristics. In iliac crest bone biopsies obtained after \nup to 60 months of treatment with strontium ranelate 2 g/day in phase III trials, no deleterious \neffects on bone quality or mineralisation were observed. \n \nThe combined effects of strontium distribution in bone (see section 5.2) and increased X-ray \nabsorption of strontium as compared to calcium, leads to an amplification of bone mineral density \n(BMD) measurement by dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Available data indicate that \nthese factors account for approximately 50% of the measured change in BMD over 3 years of \ntreatment with OSSEOR 2 g/day. This should be taken into account when interpreting BMD changes \nduring treatment with OSSEOR. In phase III studies, which demonstrated the anti-fracture efficacy \nof OSSEOR treatment, measured mean BMD increased from baseline with OSSEOR by \napproximately 4% per year at the lumbar spine and 2% per year at the femoral neck, reaching 13% \nto 15% and 5% to 6% respectively after 3 years, depending on the study. \n \nIn phase III studies, as compared to placebo, biochemical markers of bone formation (bone-specific \nalkaline phosphatase and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) increased and those of bone \nresorption (serum C-telopeptide and urinary N-telopeptide cross links) decreased from the third \nmonth of treatment up to 3 years. \n \nSecondary to the pharmacological effects of strontium ranelate, slight decreases in calcium and \nparathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentrations, increases in blood phosphorus concentrations and \nin total alkaline phosphatase activity were observed, with no observed clinical consequences. \n \nClinical efficacy \nOsteoporosis is defined as BMD of the spine or hip 2.5 SD or more below the mean value of a \nnormal young population. A number of risk factors are associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis \nincluding low bone mass, low bone mineral density, early menopause, a history of smoking and a \nfamily history of osteoporosis. The clinical consequence of osteoporosis is fractures. The risk of \nfractures is increased with the number of risk factors. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nTreatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis: \nThe anti-fracture studies program of OSSEOR was made up of two placebo-controlled phase III \nstudies: SOTI study and TROPOS study. SOTI involved 1,649 postmenopausal women with \nestablished osteoporosis (low lumbar BMD and prevalent vertebral fracture) and a mean age of \n70 years. TROPOS involved 5,091 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (low femoral neck \nBMD and prevalent fracture in more than half of them) and a mean age of 77 years. Together, SOTI \nand TROPOS enrolled 1,556 patients over 80 years at inclusion (23.1% of the study population). In \naddition to their treatment (2 g/day strontium ranelate or placebo), the patients received adapted \ncalcium and vitamin D supplements throughout both studies. \n \nOSSEOR reduced the relative risk of new vertebral fracture by 41% over 3 years in the SOTI study \n(table 1). The effect was significant from the first year. Similar benefits were demonstrated in \nwomen with multiple fractures at baseline. With respect to clinical vertebral fractures (defined as \nfractures associated with back pain and/or a body height loss of at least 1 cm), the relative risk was \nreduced by 38%. OSSEOR also decreased the number of patients with a body height loss of at least \n1 cm as compared to placebo. Quality of life assessment on the QUALIOST specific scale as well as \nthe General Health perception score of the SF-36 general scale indicated benefit of OSSEOR, \ncompared with placebo. \nEfficacy of OSSEOR to reduce the risk of new vertebral fracture was confirmed in the TROPOS \nstudy, including for osteoporotic patients without fragility fracture at baseline. \n \nTable 1: Incidence of patients with vertebral fracture and relative risk reduction \n\nStudy Placebo OSSEOR Relative Risk Reduction vs. \nplacebo (95%CI), p value \n\nSOTI N=723 N=719  \n\nNew vertebral fracture \nover 3 years \n\n32.8% 20.9% 41% (27-52), p<0.001 \n\nNew vertebral fracture \nover the 1st year \n\n11.8% 6.1% 49% (26-64), p<0.001 \n\nNew clinical vertebral \nfracture over 3 years \n\n17.4% 11.3% 38% (17-53), p<0.001 \n\nTROPOS N=1823 N=1817  \n\nNew vertebral fracture \nover 3 years \n\n20.0% 12.5% 39% (27-49), p<0.001 \n\n \nIn patients over 80 years of age at inclusion, a pooled analysis of SOTI and TROPOS studies \nshowed that OSSEOR reduced the relative risk of experiencing new vertebral fractures by 32% over \n3 years (incidence of 19.1% with strontium ranelate vs. 26.5% with placebo). \n \nIn an a-posteriori analysis of patients from the pooled SOTI and TROPOS studies with baseline \nlumbar spine and / or femoral neck BMD in the osteopenic range and without prevalent fracture but \nwith at least one additional risk factor for fracture (N=176), OSSEOR reduced the risk of a first \nvertebral fracture by 72% over 3 years (incidence of vertebral fracture 3.6% with strontium ranelate \nvs. 12.0% with placebo). \n \nAn a-posteriori analysis was performed on a subgroup of patients from the TROPOS study of \nparticular medical interest and at high-risk of fracture [defined by a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ -\n3 SD (manufacturer’s range corresponding to -2.4 SD using NHANES III) and an age ≥ 74 years \n(n=1,977, i.e. 40% of the TROPOS study population)]. In this group, over 3 years of treatment, \nOSSEOR reduced the risk of hip fracture by 36% relative to the placebo group (table 2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \nTreatment of Osteoporosis in men: \nThe efficacy of OSSEOR was demonstrated in men with osteoporosis in a 2-year, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study with a main analysis after one year in 243 patients (Intention to treat \npopulation, 161 patients received strontium ranelate) at high risk of fracture (mean age 72,7 years; \nmean lumbar BMD T-score value of -2.6; 28% of prevalent vertebral fracture). \nAll patients received daily supplemental calcium (1000 mg) and vitamin D (800 UI). \nStatistically significant increases in BMD were observed as early as 6 months following initiation of \nOSSEOR treatment versus placebo. \nOver 12 months, a statistically significant increase in mean lumbar spine BMD, main efficacy \ncriteria (E (SE) = 5.32% (0.75); 95%CI = [3.86 ; 6.79]; p<0,001), similar to that observed in the \npivotal anti-fracture phase III studies carried-out in postmenopausal women, was observed. \nStatistically significant increases in femoral neck BMD and total hip BMD (p<0,001) were observed \nafter 12 months. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOSSEOR in all subsets of the paediatric population in osteoporosis (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nStrontium ranelate is made up of 2 atoms of stable strontium and 1 molecule of ranelic acid, the \norganic part permitting the best compromise in terms of molecular weight, pharmacokinetics and \nacceptability of the medicinal product. The pharmacokinetics of strontium and ranelic acid have \nbeen assessed in healthy young men and healthy postmenopausal women, as well as during long-\nterm exposure in men with osteoporosis and postmenopausal osteoporotic women including elderly \nwomen. \n \nDue to its high polarity, the absorption, distribution and binding to plasma proteins of ranelic acid \nare low. There is no accumulation of ranelic acid and no evidence of metabolism in animals and \nhumans. Absorbed ranelic acid is rapidly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. \n \nAbsorption \nThe absolute bioavailability of strontium is about 25% (range 19-27%) after an oral dose of 2 g \nstrontium ranelate. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached 3-5 hours after a single dose of 2 g. \nSteady state is reached after 2 weeks of treatment. Intake of strontium ranelate with calcium or food \nreduces the bioavailability of strontium by approximately 60-70%, compared with administration \n3 hours after a meal. Due to the relatively slow absorption of strontium, food and calcium intake \nshould be avoided both before and after administration of OSSEOR. Oral supplementation with \nvitamin D has no effect on strontium exposure. \n \nDistribution \nStrontium has a volume of distribution of about 1 l/kg. The binding of strontium to human plasma \nproteins is low (25%) and strontium has a high affinity for bone tissue. Measurement of strontium \nconcentration in iliac crest bone biopsies from patients treated for up to 60 months with strontium \nranelate 2 g/day indicate that bone strontium concentrations may reach a plateau after about 3 years \n\nTable 2: Incidence of patients with hip fracture and relative risk reduction in patients with BMD ≤ -2.4 SD \n(NHANES III) and age ≥ 74 years \n\nStudy Placebo OSSEOR Relative Risk Reduction vs. \nplacebo (95%CI), p value \n\nTROPOS N=995 N=982  \n\nHip fracture over 3 years 6.4% 4.3% 36% (0-59), p=0.046 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nof treatment. There are no data in patients to demonstrate elimination kinetics of strontium from \nbone off-therapy. \n \nBiotransformation \nAs a divalent cation, strontium is not metabolised. Strontium ranelate does not inhibit cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination of strontium is time and dose independent. The effective half-life of strontium is \nabout 60 hours. Strontium excretion occurs via the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract. Its plasma \nclearance is about 12 ml/min (CV 22%) and its renal clearance about 7 ml/min (CV 28%). \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nElderlyPopulation pharmacokinetic data showed no relationship between age and apparent clearance \nof strontium in the target population. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/min creatinine clearance), strontium \nclearance decreases as creatinine clearance decreases (approximately 30% decrease over the \ncreatinine clearance range 30 to 70 ml/min) and thereby induces an increase in strontium plasma \nlevels. In phase III studies, 85% of the patients had a creatinine clearance between 30 and 70 ml/min \nand 6% below 30 ml/min at inclusion, and the mean creatinine clearance was about 50 ml/min. No \ndosage adjustment is therefore required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. \nThere is no pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nbelow 30 ml/min). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no pharmacokinetic data in patients with hepatic impairment. Due to the pharmacokinetic \nproperties of strontium, no effect is expected. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \n \nChronic oral administration of strontium ranelate at high doses in rodents induced bone and tooth \nabnormalities, mainly consisting of spontaneous fractures and delayed mineralisation that were \nreversible after cessation of treatment. These effects were reported at bone strontium levels 2-3 \ntimes higher than bone strontium levels in humans up to 3 years of treatment. The data on skeletal \nstrontium ranelate accumulation in longer term exposure is limited. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits resulted in bone and tooth abnormalities (e.g. bent \nlong bones and wavy ribs) in the offspring. In rats, these effects were reversible 8 weeks after \ncessation of treatment. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe environmental risk assessment of strontium ranelate has been conducted in accordance to \nEuropean guidelines on ERA. \nStrontium ranelate does not present a risk for the environment. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What OSSEOR is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take OSSEOR \n3. How to take OSSEOR \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store OSSEOR \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What OSSEOR is and what it is used for \n \nOSSEOR is a medicine used to treat severe osteoporosis: \n- in postmenopausal women, \n- in adult men, \nat high risk of fracture, for whom other alternative treatments are not possible. In postmenopausal \nwomen, strontium ranelate reduces the risk of  fracture at the spine and at the hip. \n \nAbout osteoporosis \nYour body is constantly breaking down old bone and making new bone tissue. If you have \nosteoporosis, your body breaks down more bone than it forms so that gradually bone loss occurs and \nyour bones become thinner and fragile. This is especially common in women after the menopause. \nMany people with osteoporosis have no symptoms and you may not even know that you have it. \nHowever, osteoporosis makes you more likely to have fractures (break bones), especially in your \nspine, hips and wrists. \n \nHow OSSEOR works \nOSSEOR, which contains the substance strontium ranelate, belongs to a group of medicines used to \ntreat bone diseases. \nOSSEOR works by reducing bone breakdown and stimulating rebuilding of bone and therefore \nreduces the risk of fracture. The newly formed bone is of normal quality. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take OSSEOR \n \nDo not take OSSEOR: \n- if you are allergic  to strontium ranelate or any of the other ingredients of OSSEOR (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have or have had a blood clot (for example, in the blood vessels in your legs or lungs).  \n- if you are immobilised permanently or for some time such as being wheel-chair bound, or \n\nconfined to bed or if you are to undergo an operation or recovering from an operation. The \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nrisk of vein thrombosis (blood clots in the leg or lungs) may be increased in the event of \nlengthy immobilisation. \n\n- if you have established ischaemic heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease, e.g. you have \nbeen diagnosed with a heart attack, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (temporary reduction \nof blood flow to the brain; also known as “mini-stroke”), angina, or blockages of blood \nvessels to the heart or brain.  \n\n- if you have or have had problems with your blood circulation (peripheral arterial disease) or if \nyou have had surgery on the arteries of your legs.  \n\n- if you have high blood pressure not controlled by treatment.  \n \nWarnings and precautions: \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking OSSEOR: \n- if you are at risk of heart disease, this includes  high blood pressure, high cholesterol, \n\ndiabetes, smoking. \n- if you are at risk of blood clots.  \n- if you have severe kidney disease. \nYour doctor will evaluate the conditions of your heart and blood vessels regularly, generally every 6 \nto 12 months for as long you are taking OSSEOR. \n \nDuring treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or \nthroat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), you must immediately stop taking OSSEOR \nand seek medical advice (see section 4).  \nPotentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and \nsevere hypersensitivity reactions (DRESS)) have been reported with the use of OSSEOR.  \nThe highest risk of occurrence of serious skin reactions is within the first weeks of treatment for \nStevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis and usually around 3-6 weeks for \nDRESS. \nIf you develop a rash or serious skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking OSSEOR, seek urgent \nadvice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. \nIf you have developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis or DRESS with the \nuse of OSSEOR, you must not be re-started on OSSEOR at any time \nIf you are of Asian origin, you may be at higher risk of skin reactions. \nThe risk of these skin reactions in patients of Asian origin, particularly Han Chinese, may be \npredicted. Patients who have the HLA-A*33:03 and/or the HLA-B*58:01 genes are more likely to \ndevelop a serious skin reaction than those who do not have the genes.  \n Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking OSSEOR. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nOSSEOR is not intended for use in children and adolescents (below the age of 18). \n \nOther medicines and OSSEOR: \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,  have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYou should stop taking OSSEOR if you have to take oral tetracyclines such as doxycycline or \nquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (two types of antibiotics). You can take OSSEOR again when you \nhave finished taking these antibiotics. If you are unsure about this ask your doctor or pharmacist. \nIf you are taking medicines containing calcium, you should leave at least 2 hours before you take \nOSSEOR. \nIf you take antacids (medicines to relieve heartburn) you should take them at least 2 hours after \nOSSEOR. If this is not possible, it is acceptable to take the two medicines at the same time. \nIf you need to have blood or urine tests to check your level of calcium, you should tell the laboratory \nthat you are taking OSSEOR as it may interfere with some testing methods. \n \nOSSEOR with food and drink: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nFood, milk and milk products reduce the absorption of strontium ranelate. It is recommended that \nyou take OSSEOR in-between meals, preferably at bedtime at least two hours after food, milk or \nmilk products or calcium supplements. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding: \nDo not take OSSEOR during pregnancy or when you are breastfeeding. If you take it by accident \nduring pregnancy or breastfeeding, stop taking it straight away and talk to your doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines: \nOsseor is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nOSSEOR contains aspartame (E951): \nIf you suffer from phenylketonuria (a rare, hereditary disorder of the metabolism) talk to your doctor \nbefore you start to take this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take OSSEOR \n \nThe treatment should only be started by a doctor with experience in treating osteoporosis. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nOSSEOR is for oral use. \nThe recommended dose is one 2g sachet a day. \n \nIt is recommended that you take OSSEOR at bedtime, preferably at least 2 hours after dinner. You \nmay lie down immediately after taking OSSEOR if you wish.  \n \nTake the granules contained in the sachets as a suspension in a glass containing a minimum of 30 ml \n(approximately one third of a standard glass) of water. See instructions below. OSSEOR can interact \nwith milk and milk products, so it is important that you mix OSSEOR only with water to be sure it \nworks properly. \n \n\n Empty the granules from the sachet into a glass; \n \n\n  Add water; \n \n\n  Stir until the granules are evenly dispersed in the water. \n \nDrink straight away. You should not leave more than 24 hours before you drink it. If for some \nreason you cannot drink the medicine straight away, make sure you stir it again before drinking.  \n \nYour doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements in addition to OSSEOR. Do \nnot take calcium supplements at bedtime, at the same time as OSSEOR. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nYour doctor will tell you how long you should continue to take OSSEOR. Osteoporosis-therapy is \nusually required for a long period. It is important that you continue taking OSSEOR for as long as \nyour doctor prescribes the medicine. \n \nIf you take more OSSEOR than you should: \nIf you take more sachets of OSSEOR than recommended by your doctor, tell your doctor or \npharmacist. They may advise you to drink milk or take antacids to reduce the absorption of the \nactive ingredient. \n \nIf you forget to take OSSEOR: \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. Just carry on with the next dose \nat the normal time. \n \nIf you stop taking OSSEOR: \nIt is important that you continue taking OSSEOR for as long as your doctor prescribes the medicine. \nOSSEOR can treat your severe osteoporosis only if you continue to take it. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nIf the following happens to you, stop using OSSEOR and talk to your doctor immediately: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n− Heart attack: sudden crushing pains in your chest which may reach your left arm, jaw, \n\nstomach, back and/or shoulders. Other symptoms may be nausea/vomiting, sweating, \nshortness of breath, palpitations, (extreme) tiredness and/or dizziness.

Your doctor will not prescribe OSSEOR \nfor you if you are at particular risk.   \n\n− Blood clots in veins: pain, redness, swelling in your leg, sudden chest pain or difficulty \nbreathing. \n\n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): \n− Signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions (DRESS): initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash \n\non the face then an extended rash with a high temperature (uncommon), increased levels of \nliver enzymes seen in blood tests (uncommon) an increase in a type of white blood cell \n(eosinophilia) (rare) and enlarged lymph nodes (uncommon). \n\n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n− Signs of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis): initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters \non the trunk. Additional signs may include ulcers in the mouth, throat, nose, genitals and \nconjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). These potentially life-threatening skin rashes are often \naccompanied by flu-like symptoms. The rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling \nof the skin. \n\n \nOther possible side effects \n \nVery Common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \nItching, hives, skin rash, angioedema (such as swollen face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing \nor swallowing), bone, limb, muscle and/or joint pain, muscle cramps. \n \nCommon:  \nVomiting, abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, constipation, flatulence, difficulty in sleeping, \ninflammation of the liver (hepatitis), swelling in limbs, bronchial hyperreactivity (symptoms include \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nwheezing and shortness of breath and cough), increased level of a muscle enzyme (Creatine \nphosphokinase), increased levels of cholesterol. \nNausea, diarrhoea, headache, eczema, memory trouble, fainting fit, pins and needles, dizziness, \nvertigo. However, these effects were mild and short-lived and usually did not cause the patients to \nstop taking their treatment. Talk to your doctor if any effects become troublesome or persist. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \nSeizures, oral irritation (such as mouth ulcers and gum inflammation), hair loss, feeling confused, \nfeeling unwell, dry mouth, skin irritation. \n \nRare: \nReduction in production of blood cells in the bone marrow.  \n \nIf you have stopped treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions, do not take OSSEOR again \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
