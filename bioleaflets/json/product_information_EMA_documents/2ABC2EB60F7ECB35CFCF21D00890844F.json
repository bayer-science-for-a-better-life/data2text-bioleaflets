QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNovoRapid vial \n1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 1,000 units.1 ml solution contains 100 units insulin aspart* \n(equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n \nNovoRapid Penfill \n1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units.1 ml solution contains 100 units insulin aspart* \n(equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n \nNovoRapid FlexPen/NovoRapid InnoLet/NovoRapid FlexTouch \n1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units.1 ml solution contains 100 units insulin aspart* \n(equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n \nNovoRapid PumpCart \n1 cartridge contains 1.6 ml equivalent to 160 units.1 ml solution contains 100 units insulin aspart* \n(equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n \n*Insulin aspart is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nThe solution is clear, colourless and aqueous.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNovoRapid is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 \nyear and above.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency \nof human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nNovoRapid dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. It should \nnormally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMoreover NovoRapid vial and NovoRapid PumpCart can be used for continuous subcutaneous insulin \ninfusion (CSII) in pump systems. \n \nNovoRapid vial can also be used if intravenous administration of insulin aspart, by physicians or other \nhealthcare staff, is applicable.  \n \nBlood glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal \nglycaemic control. \n \nThe individual insulin requirement in adults and children is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. \nIn a basal-bolus treatment regimen 50â€“70% of this requirement may be provided by NovoRapid and \nthe remainder by intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin. \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (â‰¥ 65 years old) \nNovoRapid can be used in elderly patients. \nIn elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an \nindividual basis. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements. \nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin \naspart dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nNovoRapid can be used in children and adolescents aged 1 year and above in preference to soluble \nhuman insulin when a rapid onset of action might be beneficial, for example, in the timing of the \ninjections in relation to meals (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of NovoRapid in children below 1 year of age have not been established. \nNo data are available.  \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nWhen transferring from other insulin medicinal products, adjustment of the NovoRapid dose and the \ndose of the basal insulin may be necessary. NovoRapid has a faster onset and a shorter duration of \naction than soluble human insulin. When injected subcutaneously into the abdominal wall, the onset of \naction will occur within 10â€“20 minutes of injection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and \n3 hours after the injection. The duration of action is 3 to 5 hours. \n \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nNovoRapid is a rapid-acting insulin analogue.  \nNovoRapid is administered subcutaneously by injection in the abdominal wall, the thigh, the upper \narm, the deltoid region or the gluteal region. Injection sites should always be rotated within the same \nregion in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. Subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall \nensures a faster absorption than other injection sites. Compared to soluble human insulin the faster \nonset of action of NovoRapid is maintained regardless of the injection site. The duration of action will \nvary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of physical activity.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDue to the faster onset of action, NovoRapid should generally be given immediately before a meal. \nWhen necessary NovoRapid can be given soon after a meal.  \n \nNovoRapid vial/NovoRapid PumpCart \nContinuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) \nNovoRapid may be used for CSII in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion. CSII should be \nadministered in the abdominal wall. Infusion sites should be rotated. \n\n \nWhen used with an insulin infusion pump, NovoRapid should not be mixed with any other insulin \nmedicinal products. \n \nPatients using CSII should be comprehensively instructed in the use of the pump system and use the \ncorrect reservoir and tubing for the pump (see section 6.6). The infusion set (tubing and cannula) \nshould be changed in accordance with the instructions in the product information supplied with the \ninfusion set. \n \nPatients administering NovoRapid by CSII must have an alternative insulin delivery method available \nin case of pump system failure. \n \nNovoRapid vial \nIntravenous use \nIf necessary, NovoRapid can be administered intravenously which should be carried out by physicians \nor other healthcare staff. \n \nFor intravenous use, infusion systems with NovoRapid 100 units/ml at concentrations from \n0.05 unit/ml to 1.0 unit/ml insulin aspart in the infusion fluids 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% dextrose or \n10% dextrose including 40 mmol/l potassium chloride using polypropylene infusion bags, are stable at \nroom temperature for 24 hours.  \n \nAlthough stable over time, a certain amount of insulin will be initially adsorbed to the material of the \ninfusion bag. Monitoring of blood glucose is necessary during insulin infusion. \n \nMixing two types of insulins \nNovoRapid can only be mixed with NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin in a syringe for \nsubcutaneous use. When NovoRapid is mixed with NPH insulin, NovoRapid should be drawn into the \nsyringe first, and the mixture should be injected immediately after mixing. Insulin mixtures should not \nbe administered intravenously or used with a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump. \n \nAdministration with a syringe \nNovoRapid vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale. See also section \n6.2.  \n \nNovoRapid Penfill \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nNovoRapid Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. NovoRapid Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \npen. If administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If \nadministration by infusion pump is necessary, a vial or NovoRapid PumpCart should be used. \n \nNovoRapid FlexPen \nAdministration with FlexPen \nNovoRapid FlexPen is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or \nNovoTwist disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm. FlexPen delivers 1â€“60 units in increments of \n1 unit. NovoRapid FlexPen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe or \nintravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If administration by infusion pump is \nnecessary, a vial or NovoRapid PumpCart should be used. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nNovoRapid InnoLet \nAdministration with InnoLet \nNovoRapid InnoLet is a pre-filled pen designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable \nneedles up to a length of 8 mm. InnoLet delivers 1â€“50 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoRapid \nInnoLet is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe or intravenous \ninjection is necessary, a vial should be used. If administration by infusion pump is necessary, a vial or \nNovoRapid PumpCart should be used. \n \nNovoRapid FlexTouch \nAdministration with FlexTouch \nNovoRapid FlexTouch is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or \nNovoTwist disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm. FlexTouch delivers 1â€“80 units in increments of \n1 unit. NovoRapid FlexTouch is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe \nor intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If administration by infusion pump is \nnecessary, a vial or NovoRapid PumpCart should be used. \n \nNovoRapid PumpCart \nAdministration via Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) \nNovoRapid PumpCart is only for use with an insulin infusion pump system designed to be used with \nthis cartridge, such as the Accu-Chek Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps.  \nCSII should be administered in the abdominal wall. Infusion sites should be rotated. NovoRapid \nPumpCart is only suitable for CSII in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion. If administration by \nsyringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \n \nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctorâ€™s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \nNovoRapid PumpCart  \nMisuse of NovoRapid PumpCart \nNovoRapid PumpCart is only for use with an insulin infusion pump system designed to be used with \nthis cartridge, such as the Accu-Chek Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps. It must not be used with \nother devices not designed for NovoRapid PumpCart, as this may result in incorrect insulin dosing and \nsubsequent hyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop \ngradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, \nvomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEspecially in children, care should be taken to match insulin doses (especially in basal-bolus regimens) \nwith food intake, physical activities and current blood glucose level in order to minimise the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected NovoRapid must not be injected. After \nstabilisation of patientâ€™s blood glucose adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.8 \nand 4.9). \n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nA consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if hypoglycaemia \noccurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human insulin. \n \nSince NovoRapid should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action \nshould be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of \nfood might be expected. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patientâ€™s \ninsulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal, human insulin or human \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to NovoRapid from another type of insulin \nmay require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their \nusual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during \nthe first few weeks or months.  \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of NovoRapid. \n \nCombination of NovoRapid with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and NovoRapid is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between NovoRapid and other insulin products. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nInsulin antibodies  \n \nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. \n \nThe following substances may reduce the patient's insulin requirements: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin \nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulphonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth hormone \nand danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nNovoRapid (insulin aspart) can be used in pregnancy. Data from two randomised controlled clinical \ntrials (322 and 27 exposed pregnancies) do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin aspart on \npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn when compared to human insulin (see section 5.1). \n \nIntensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes (type 1 diabetes, \ntype 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes) are recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase \nsubsequently during the second and third trimester. After delivery, insulin requirements normally \nreturn rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with NovoRapid during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the NovoRapid dose may need to be adjusted.  \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human insu-\nlin regarding fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patientâ€™s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \n\n\n\n8 \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions observed in patients using NovoRapid are mainly due to the pharmacologic effect of \ninsulin. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control (see \nsection 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). \n \nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (â‰¥ 1/10); common (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (â‰¥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (â‰¥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon â€“ Urticaria, rash, eruptions \n\n \nVery rare â€“ Anaphylactic reactions* \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common â€“ Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Rare â€“ Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nUncommon â€“ Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon â€“ Diabetic retinopathy \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon â€“ Lipodystrophy* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nUncommon â€“ Injection site reactions \n\nUncommon â€“ Oedema \n \n\n* see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions: \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia: \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. During clinical trials the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ \nbetween patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. \n \nLipodystrophy: \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular injection area reduces the risk of developing these \nreactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader \nexperience in the general population. \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in the elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not \nindicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if too high doses relative to the patientâ€™s requirement are administered: \n \nâ€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\nâ€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by physicians or other healthcare staff. Glucose must be given \nintravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon \nregaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in \norder to prevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. \nATC code: A10AB05. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nNovoRapid produces a more rapid onset of action compared to soluble human insulin, together with a \nlower glucose concentration, as assessed within the first four hours after a meal. NovoRapid has a \nshorter duration of action compared to soluble human insulin after subcutaneous injection. \n \n\n \n \nFig. I. Blood glucose concentrations following a single pre-meal dose of NovoRapid injected \nimmediately before a meal (solid curve) or soluble human insulin administered 30 minutes before a \nmeal (hatched curve) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. \n \nWhen NovoRapid is injected subcutaneously, the onset of action will occur within 10 to 20 minutes of \ninjection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and 3 hours after injection. The duration of action \nis 3 to 5 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated a lower postprandial blood glucose \nwith NovoRapid compared to soluble human insulin (Fig. I). In two long-term open label trials in \npatients with type 1 diabetes comprising 1070 and 884 patients, respectively, NovoRapid reduced \nglycated haemoglobin by 0.12 [95% C.I. 0.03; 0.22] percentage points and by 0.15 [95% C.I. 0.05; \n0.26] percentage points compared to human insulin; a difference of limited clinical significance. \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced risk of nocturnal \nhypoglycaemia with insulin aspart compared with soluble human insulin. The risk of daytime \nhypoglycaemia was not significantly increased. \n \nInsulin aspart is equipotent to soluble human insulin on a molar basis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nElderly (â‰¥ 65 years old) \nA randomised, double-blind cross-over PK/PD trial comparing insulin aspart with soluble human \ninsulin was performed in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (19 patients aged 65â€“83 years, mean age \n70 years). The relative differences in the pharmacodynamic properties (GIRmax,AUCGIR, 0â€“120 min) \nbetween insulin aspart and soluble human insulin in the elderly were similar to those seen in healthy \nsubjects and in younger patients with diabetes. \n \nPaediatric population \nA clinical trial comparing preprandial soluble human insulin with postprandial insulin aspart was \nperformed in small children (20 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, studied for 12 weeks, among those \nfour were younger than 4 years old) and a single dose PK/PD trial was performed in children (6â€“\n12 years) and adolescents (13â€“17 years). The pharmacodynamic profile of insulin aspart in children \nwas similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of NovoRapid given as bolus insulin in combination with either insulin \ndetemir or insulin degludec as basal insulin has been studied for up to 12 months, in two randomised \ncontrolled clinical trials in adolescents and children aged 1 to less than 18 years (n=712). The trials \nincluded 167 children aged 1â€“5 years, 260 aged 6â€“11 and 285 aged 12â€“17. The observed \nimprovements in HbA1c and the safety profiles were comparable between all age groups. \n \nPregnancy \nA clinical trial comparing safety and efficacy of insulin aspart vs. human insulin in the treatment of \npregnant women with type 1 diabetes (322 exposed pregnancies (insulin aspart: 157; human insulin: \n165)) did not indicate any adverse effect of insulin aspart on pregnancy or on the health of the \nfoetus/newborn. \nIn addition the data from a clinical trial including 27 women with gestational diabetes randomised to \ntreatment with insulin aspart vs. human insulin (insulin aspart: 14; human insulin: 13) showed similar \nsafety profiles between treatments. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption, distribution and elimination \n \nIn NovoRapid substitution of amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 reduces the \ntendency to form hexamers as observed with soluble human insulin. NovoRapid is therefore more \nrapidly absorbed from the subcutaneous layer compared to soluble human insulin. \n \nThe time to maximum concentration is, on average, half of that for soluble human insulin. A mean \nmaximum plasma concentration of 492Â±256 pmol/l was reached 40 (interquartile range: 30â€“40) \nminutes after a subcutaneous dose of 0.15 unit/kg bodyweight in type 1 diabetic patients. The insulin \nconcentrations returned to baseline about 4 to 6 hours after dose. The absorption rate was somewhat \nslower in type 2 diabetic patients, resulting in a lower Cmax (352Â±240 pmol/l) and later tmax (60 \n(interquartile range: 50â€“90) minutes). The intra-individual variability in time to maximum \nconcentration is significantly less for NovoRapid than for soluble human insulin, whereas the intra-\nindividual variability in Cmax for NovoRapid is larger.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (â‰¥ 65 years old) \nThe relative differences in pharmacokinetic properties between insulin aspart and soluble human \ninsulin in elderly patients (65â€“83 years, mean age 70 years) with type 2 diabetes were similar to those \nobserved in healthy subjects and in younger patients with diabetes. A decreased absorption rate was \nobserved in elderly patients, resulting in a later tmax (82 (interquartile range: 60â€“120) minutes), \nwhereas Cmax was similar to that observed in younger patients with type 2 diabetes and slightly lower \nthan in patients with type 1 diabetes. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n12 \n\nA single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart was performed in 24 subjects with hepatic \nfunction ranging from normal to severely impaired. In patients with hepatic impairment, absorption \nrate was decreased and more variable, resulting in delayed tmax from about 50 min in subjects with \nnormal hepatic function to about 85 min in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. \nAUC, Cmax and CL/F were similar in patients with reduced hepatic function compared with subjects \nwith normal hepatic function. \n \nRenal impairment \nA single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart in 18 subjects with renal function ranging from \nnormal to severely impaired was performed. No apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on \nAUC, Cmax, CL/F and tmax of insulin aspart was found. Data were limited in patients with moderate and \nsevere renal impairment. Patients with renal failure necessitating dialysis treatment were not \ninvestigated.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of NovoRapid were investigated in children \n(6â€“12 years) and adolescents (13â€“17 years) with type 1 diabetes. Insulin aspart was rapidly absorbed \nin both age groups, with similar tmax as in adults. However, Cmax differed between the age groups, \nstressing the importance of the individual titration of NovoRapid. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, \ninsulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that \nthe dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNovoRapid 100 units/ml solution for injection in vial \nInsulin aspart \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nâ€¢ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nâ€¢ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€¢ If you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid  \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoRapid \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for \n \nNovoRapid is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin products \nare improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoRapid is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year \nand above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with NovoRapid helps to prevent \ncomplications from your diabetes. \n \nNovoRapid will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect \noccurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3â€“5 hours. Due to this short \naction NovoRapid should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting \ninsulin preparations. Moreover NovoRapid can be used for continuous infusion in a pump system. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid \n \nDo not use NovoRapid  \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4). \nâ–º If the protective cap is loose or missing. Each vial has a protective, tamper-proof plastic cap. If \n\nit is not in perfect condition when you get the vial, return the vial to your supplier. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see section 5, How to store NovoRapid). \nâ–º If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. \n \nIf any of these applies, do not use NovoRapid. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Remove the protective cap. \nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and syringes must not be shared. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nof your injections. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried \nout in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and NovoRapid \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \n\n\n\n58 \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. NovoRapid can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoRapid during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.  \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and \ntherefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger \nyourself or others. \n \nNovoRapid has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of NovoRapid \n \nNovoRapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoRapid is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nNovoRapid is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of the \ninjection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoRapid can be given soon after a meal. See \nHow and where to inject below for information. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \nNovoRapid can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human \ninsulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in \nrelation to meals.  \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoRapid is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously) or for continuous infusion in a pump \nsystem. Administration in a pump system will require a comprehensive instruction by your healthcare \nprofessional. You must never inject yourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle \n(intramuscularly). If necessary NovoRapid can be given directly into a vein but this must only be done \nby physicians or other healthcare staff. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front \nof your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if injected into the front of your waist. You should \nalways measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nNPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with \nNovoRapid and the mixture must be injected immediately under your skin (subcutaneously). \nNovoRapid should be drawn into the syringe before you draw your NPH insulin. \n \nHow to take NovoRapid \n \nIf you use only one type of insulin \n1. Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. \n\nInject the air into the vial. \n2. Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull \n\nthe needle out of the vial. Then expel the air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct. \n \nIf you have to mix two types of insulin \n1. Just before use, roll the NPH insulin between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and \n\ncloudy. \n2. Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of the NPH insulin. Inject the air into \n\nthe vial containing the NPH insulin and pull out the needle. \n3. Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of NovoRapid. Inject the air into the \n\nvial containing NovoRapid. Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw up the prescribed \ndose of NovoRapid. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct. \n\n4. Push the needle into the vial of the NPH insulin, turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw \nout the dose you have been prescribed. Expel any air from the syringe and check the dose. Inject \nthe mixture immediately. \n\n5. Always mix NovoRapid and the NPH insulin in the same sequence. \n \nHow to inject NovoRapid \n \nâ–º Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse. \nâ–º Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the \n\ninsulin. \nâ–º Discard the needle after each injection. \n \nFor use in an infusion pump system \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nNovoRapid should never be mixed with any other insulin when used in a pump.  \nFollow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of NovoRapid in a \npump. Before use of NovoRapid in the pump system, you must have received a comprehensive \ninstruction in the use and information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, too high or too \nlow blood sugar or failure of the pump system.  \nâ€¢ Before inserting the needle, use soap and water to clean your hands and the skin where the \n\nneedle is inserted to avoid any infection at the infusion site. \nâ€¢ When you fill a new reservoir, be certain not to leave large air bubbles in either the syringe or \n\nthe tubing. \nâ€¢ Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in \n\nthe product information supplied with the infusion set. \n \nTo get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect possible malfunction of the insulin pump, it is \nrecommended that you measure your blood sugar level regularly. \n \nWhat to do in case of pump system failure \n \nYou should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under \nthe skin in case of pump system failure. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid in section 2). \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, \ncontinue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection \nof glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. \nThe amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink due to risk of suffocation. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoRapid or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be a result of leakage of insulin. If you suspect the \ncartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further instructions. \n\nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoRapid Penfill must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoRapid Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nof your injections. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried \nout in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and NovoRapid \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. NovoRapid can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoRapid during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and \ntherefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger \nyourself or others. \n \nNovoRapid has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of NovoRapid \n \nNovoRapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoRapid is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nNovoRapid is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of the \ninjection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoRapid can be given soon after a meal. See \nHow and where to inject below for information. \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nNovoRapid can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human \ninsulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in \nrelation to meals.  \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject  \nNovoRapid is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself directly \ninto a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoRapid Penfill is only suitable for \ninjecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \nanother method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front \nof your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if injected into the front of your waist. You should \nalways measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nâ–º Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \nâ–º NovoRapid Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles.  \nâ–º If you are treated with NovoRapid Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \nâ–º Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case it is lost or damaged. \n \nHow to inject NovoRapid \n \nâ–º Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \nâ–º Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir.  \n\nâ–º Remove and discard the needle after each injection. Always store NovoRapid without the needle \nattached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin  \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be  \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \n\n\n\n68 \n\nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, \ncontinue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection \nof glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. \nThe amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink due to risk of suffocation. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoRapid or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n70 \n\nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

What you need to know before you use NovoRapid  \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoRapid \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for \n \nNovoRapid is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin products \nare improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoRapid is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year \nand above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with NovoRapid helps to prevent \ncomplications from your diabetes. \n \nNovoRapid will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect \noccurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3â€“5 hours. Due to this short \naction NovoRapid should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting \ninsulin preparations. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid \n \nDo not use NovoRapid  \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4). \nâ–º If FlexPen is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see section 5, How to store NovoRapid). \nâ–º If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.  \n \nIf any of these applies, do not use NovoRapid. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid \n \nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n\n\n\n73 \n\nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoRapid FlexPen must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoRapid FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \n\nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor.  \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nof your injections. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried \nout in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and NovoRapid \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \n\n\n\n74 \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure.

It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \n\n\n\n77 \n\nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat NovoRapid contains \n \nâ€¢ The active substance is insulin aspart. Each ml contains 100 units of insulin aspart. Each pre-\n\nfilled pen contains 300 units of insulin aspart in 3 ml solution for injection. \nâ€¢ The other ingredients are glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc chloride, disodium phosphate \n\ndihydrate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water for injections. \n \nWhat NovoRapid looks like and contents of the pack \n \nNovoRapid is presented as a solution for injection. \n \nPack sizes of 1 (with or without needles), 5 (without needles) and 10 (without needles) pre-filled pens \nof 3 ml. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nThe solution is clear and colourless. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S, Novo AllÃ©, DK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark  \n \nManufacturer \n \nThe manufacturer can be identified by the batch number printed on the slip of the carton and on the \nlabel: \n \nâ€¢ If the second and third characters are S6, P5, K7, R7, VG, FG or ZF, the manufacturer is Novo \n\nNordisk A/S, Novo AllÃ©, DK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark. \n \nâ€¢ If the second and third characters are H7 or T6, the manufacturer is Novo Nordisk Production \n\nSAS, 45 Avenue dâ€™OrlÃ©ans F-28000 Chartres, France. \n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your FlexPen. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n79 \n\nInstructions on how to use NovoRapid solution for injection in FlexPen.  \n \nRead the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the \ninstructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low \nblood sugar level. \n \nYour FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in \nincrements of 1 unit. FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles \nup to a length of 8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in \ncase your FlexPen is lost or damaged. \n \n NovoRapid FlexPen \n\nPen cap Cartridge \nResidual scale \n\nPointer \n\nDose \nselector Push- \n\nbutton \nBig outer  \nneedle cap \n\nInner needle cap Paper tab \n\nNeedle \n\nNeedle (example) \n\n \n \nCaring for your pen \nYour FlexPen must be handled with care.  \nIf it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate \ndosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level.  \n \nYou can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak it, wash \nor lubricate it as it may damage the pen.  \n \nDo not refill your FlexPen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n \nPreparing your NovoRapid FlexPen \n \nCheck the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of \ninsulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n \nA \nPull off the pen cap.  \n \n\n \n \nB \nRemove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. \n \nScrew the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. \n \n\n \n \nC \nPull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later. \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n \nD \nPull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. \n \nNever try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. \n \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \n\n \n Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \n\n \nChecking the insulin flow \n \nPrior to each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To \navoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \n \nE \nTurn the dose selector to select 2 units. \n \n E \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \nF \nHold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \nfew times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n \n F \n\n \n \nG \nKeeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. \n \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no \nmore than 6 times. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\n G \n\n \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that \nthe insulin flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose \nselector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \nSelecting your dose \n \nCheck that the dose selector is set at 0. \n \nH \nTurn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. \n \nThe dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-\nbutton as insulin will come out. \n \nYou cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. \n \n\n \n \n\n Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before \ninjecting the insulin.  \n\n Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \nget too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much \ninsulin is left in your pen.  \n\n \nMaking the injection \n \nInsert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. \n \nI \nInject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful \nonly to push the push-button when injecting. \n \nTurning the dose selector will not inject insulin. \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n \nJ \nKeep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds. \nThis will make sure you get the full dose. \n \nWithdraw the needle from the skin, then release the pressure on the push-button. \n \nAlways make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops \nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood sugar \nlevel. \n \n J \n\n \n \nK \nLead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, \ncarefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  \n \nDispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on.  \n \n\n \n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles \nand inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nFurther important information \n \n\n Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles â€“ to reduce the risk of needle sticks \nand cross-infection. \n\n \n Dispose of your used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. \n\n \n Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n\n \n Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n\n \n Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n\n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNovoRapid InnoLet 100 units/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nInsulin aspart \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nâ€¢ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nâ€¢ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€¢ If you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoRapid \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for  \n \nNovoRapid is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin products \nare improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoRapid is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year \nand above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with NovoRapid helps to prevent \ncomplications from your diabetes. \n \nNovoRapid will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect \noccurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3â€“5 hours. Due to this short \naction NovoRapid should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting \ninsulin preparations. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid \n \nDo not use NovoRapid  \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4). \nâ–º If InnoLet is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see section 5, How to store NovoRapid). \nâ–º If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.  \n \nIf any of these applies, do not use NovoRapid. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid \n \nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n\n\n\n84 \n\nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoRapid InnoLet must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoRapid InnoLet is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \n\nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nof your injections. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried \nout in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and NovoRapid \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \n\n\n\n85 \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. NovoRapid can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoRapid during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and \ntherefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger \nyourself or others. \n \nNovoRapid has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of NovoRapid \n \nNovoRapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoRapid is essentially â€˜sodium-\nfreeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nNovoRapid is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of the \ninjection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoRapid can be given soon after a meal. See \nHow and where to inject below for information. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \nNovoRapid can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human \ninsulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in \nrelation to meals.  \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject  \n \nNovoRapid is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself directly \ninto a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoRapid InnoLet is only suitable for \ninjecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front \nof your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if injected into the front of your waist. You should \nalways measure your blood sugar regularly.  \n \nHow to handle NovoRapid InnoLet \n \nNovoRapid InnoLet is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin aspart. \n \nRead carefully the instructions on how to use NovoRapid InnoLet included in this package leaflet. \nYou must use the pen as described in the instructions on how to use NovoRapid Innolet. \n \nAlways ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin  \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \n\n\n\n87 \n\npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, \ncontinue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection \nof glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. \nThe amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink due to risk of suffocation. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoRapid or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5. How to store NovoRapid  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the InnoLet label and carton, after \nâ€˜EXPâ€™.

Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nThe solution is clear and colourless.  \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S, Novo AllÃ©, DK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark \n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your InnoLet. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n90 \n\nInstructions on how to use NovoRapid solution for injection in InnoLet  \n \nRead the instructions carefully before using your InnoLet. If you do not follow the instructions \ncarefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar \nlevel. \n \nYour InnoLet is a simple, compact pre-filled pen able to deliver 1 to 50 units in increments of 1 unit. \nInnoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length of \n8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your InnoLet \nis lost or damaged. \n \n \n\nPush-button \n\nDose \nselector \n\nDose scale \n\nCompartment \nfor needles \n\nResidual \nscale \n\nInsulin \ncartridge \n\nDisposable needle (example) \n\nPen cap \nPaper tab \n\nNeedle \n\nInner needle \ncap \n\nBig outer \nneedle cap \n\n \n \nGetting started \n \nCheck the name and coloured label of your InnoLet to make sure that it contains the correct type of \ninsulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \nTake off the pen cap. \n \nAttaching the needle \n \nâ€¢ Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \n\nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \nâ€¢ Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \nâ€¢ Remove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. \nâ€¢ Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your InnoLet (picture 1A). \nâ€¢ Pull off the big outer needle cap and the inner needle cap. You may want to store the big \n\nouter needle cap in the compartment. \n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the \n\nneedle. \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n \nPriming to expel air prior to each injection \n \nSmall amounts of air may collect in the needle and cartridge during normal use. \n \nTo avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \nâ€¢ Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise. \nâ€¢ Hold your InnoLet with the needle upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \n\nfew times (picture 1B) to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \nâ€¢ Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to 0. \nâ€¢ Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before injection (picture 1B). This \n\nmakes sure the insulin flows. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than \n6 times. \n\n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the device is defective and must not be used. \n \nâ€¢ If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose selector may move. \n\nThis may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n \nâ€¢ Always prime InnoLet before you inject. If you do not prime InnoLet, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \n 1B \n\n \n \nSetting the dose \n \nâ€¢ Always check that the push-button is fully depressed and the dose selector is set to 0. \nâ€¢ Dial the number of units required by turning the dose selector clockwise (picture 2).  \n\n\n\n92 \n\nâ€¢ You will hear a click for every single unit dialled. The dose can be corrected by turning the \ndial either way. Make sure not to turn the dial or correct the dose when the needle is inserted in \nthe skin. This may lead to inaccurate dosing that can make your blood sugar level too high or \ntoo low. \n\n \n Always use the dose scale and the dose selector to see how many units you have selected before \n\ninjecting the insulin. Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your \nblood sugar level may get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows \napproximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n\n \nYou cannot set a dose larger than the number of units remaining in the cartridge. \n \n 2 \n\n \n \nInjecting the insulin  \n \nâ€¢ Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor. \nâ€¢ Deliver the dose by pressing the push-button fully down (picture 3). You will hear clicks as \n\nthe dose selector returns to 0. \nâ€¢ After the injection, the needle should remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure \n\nthat the full dose has been delivered. \nâ€¢ Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed \n\nto return to 0 when you press the push-button. Always make sure that the dose selector returns \nto 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been \ndelivered, which may result in too high blood sugar level. \n\nâ€¢ Discard the needle after each injection. \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n 3 \n\n \n \nRemoving the needle \n \nâ€¢ Replace the big outer needle cap and unscrew the needle (picture 4). Dispose of it carefully. \nâ€¢ Put the pen cap back on your InnoLet to protect the insulin from light. \n \n 4 \n\n \n \nAlways use a new needle for each injection. Always remove and discard the needle after each injection \nand store your InnoLet without the needle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \n \nFurther important information \n \nCaregivers must be very careful when handling used needles â€“ to reduce the risk of needle sticks and \ncross-infection.  \n \nDispose of your used InnoLet carefully without the needle attached.  \n \nNever share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n \nNever share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n \nAlways keep your InnoLet and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n \nCaring for your pen \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \nYour InnoLet is designed to work accurately and safely. It must be handled with care. If it is dropped, \ndamaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can \nlead to too high or too low blood sugar level. \nYou can clean your InnoLet by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, wash or lubricate it. \nThis may damage the mechanism and may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too \nlow blood sugar level. \nDo not refill your InnoLet. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNovoRapid FlexTouch 100 units/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nInsulin aspart \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nâ€¢ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nâ€¢ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€¢ If you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid  \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoRapid \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoRapid is and what it is used for \n \nNovoRapid is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin products \nare improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoRapid is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year \nand above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with NovoRapid helps to prevent \ncomplications from your diabetes. \n \nNovoRapid will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect \noccurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3â€“5 hours. Due to this short \naction NovoRapid should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting \ninsulin preparations. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid \n \nDo not use NovoRapid  \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4). \nâ–º If FlexTouch is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see section 5, How to store NovoRapid). \nâ–º If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.  \n \nIf any of these applies, do not use NovoRapid. Talk with your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoRapid FlexTouch must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoRapid FlexTouch is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \n\nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor.  \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nof your injections.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried \nout in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and NovoRapid \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \n\n\n\n97 \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. NovoRapid can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoRapid during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.  \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and \ntherefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger \nyourself or others. \n \nNovoRapid has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of NovoRapid \n \nNovoRapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoRapid is essentially â€˜sodium-\nfreeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoRapid \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nNovoRapid is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of the \ninjection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoRapid can be given soon after a meal. See \nHow and where to inject below for information. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \nNovoRapid can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human \ninsulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in \nrelation to meals.  \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoRapid is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself directly \ninto a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoRapid FlexTouch is only suitable for \ninjecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front \nof your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if injected into the front of your waist. You should \nalways measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nHow to handle NovoRapid FlexTouch \n \nNovoRapid FlexTouch is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing insulin aspart. \n \nRead carefully the instructions on how to use NovoRapid FlexTouch included in this package leaflet. \nYou must use the pen as described in the instructions on how to use NovoRapid FlexTouch. \n \nAlways ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin  \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \n\n\n\n99 \n\npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, \ncontinue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection \nof glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. \nThe amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink due to risk of suffocation. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoRapid or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \n\n\n\n100 \n\nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \n\n \n Never use a bent or damaged needle. \n\n \n \nChecking the insulin flow \n \nMake sure that you receive your full dose by always checking the insulin flow before you select \nand inject your dose. \n \nF Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. \n \n F \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \nG Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. \n \n Tap the top of the pen a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. \n \n G \n\n \n \nH Press the dose button with your thumb until the dose counter returns to 0. The 0 must line up \n\nwith the dose pointer. A drop of insulin will appear at the needle tip. \n \n If no drop appears, repeat steps F to H up to 6 times. If no drop appears after these new \n\nattempts, change the needle and repeat steps F to H once more. \n \n Do not use the pen if a drop of insulin still does not appear. \n \n H \n\n \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure \n\nthat the insulin flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose \ncounter may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \n \nSelecting your dose \n \nUse the dose selector on your NovoRapid FlexTouch pen to select your dose. You can select up to \n80 units per dose. \n \nI Select the dose you need. You can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards. Stop when the \n\nright number of units lines up with the dose pointer. \n \n The dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of \n\nunits left. \n \n When the pen contains less than 80 units, the dose counter stops at the number of units left. \n  \n I \n\n5 units \nselected \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\n Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected \n before injecting the insulin.  \n\nDo not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \nget too high or too low. \n\n Do not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n \n\n How much insulin is left? \n The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n \n \n\nApprox. \nhow much \n\ninsulin is \nleft \n\n \n \nTo see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: \nTurn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. If it shows 80, at least 80 units are left in your \npen. If it shows less than 80, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. \n \nTurn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \nIf you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two pens. \n \n \n\nDose \ncounter \n\nstopped: \n52 units \n\nleft \n \n\nExample \n\n \n \n\n Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. \n If in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too \n\nlittle or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. \n \n \nInjecting your dose \n \nMake sure that you receive your full dose by using the right injection technique.  \n \nJ Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. Make sure you can see \n\nthe dose counter. Do not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the \ninjection.  \n\n \nPress the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. The 0 must line up with the dose \npointer. You may then hear or feel a click. \n \n\n After the dose counter has returned to 0, leave the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds \nto make sure that you get your full dose. \n\n \n \n\n6 seconds \n\nJ \n\n \n \nK Remove the needle from the skin. \n \n After that, you may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on \n\nthe dose you just received. \n \n\n Always dispose of the needle after each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, \ninfection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the needle is blocked, \nyou will not inject any insulin. \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n K \n\n \n \nL Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface. Do not touch the needle or the \n\ncap. \n \n Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew \n\nthe needle. Dispose of it carefully, and put the pen cap back on after every use. \n \n When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse or \n\nlocal authorities. \n \n L \n\n \n \n\n Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject.  \nThe dose counter will show the exact number of units. Do not count the pen clicks. \n\n Hold the dose button down until the dose counter returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose \ncounter stops before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too \nhigh blood sugar level. \n\n \n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the \n\nneedle. \n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles \nand inaccurate dosing. \n\n \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nTreat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to \ntoo high or too low blood sugar level. \n \nâ€¢ Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. \n \nâ€¢ Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. \n \nâ€¢ Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a \n\nmoistened cloth.  \n \nâ€¢ Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces.  \n\nIf you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the insulin flow before you \ninject. \n\n \nâ€¢ Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \nâ€¢ Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \n \n \n\n Important information \n \nâ€¢ Always keep your pen with you. \n \nâ€¢ Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you, in case of loss or damage. \n \nâ€¢ Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n \nâ€¢ Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n \nâ€¢ Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n \nâ€¢ Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles â€“ to reduce the risk of needle \n\ninjury and cross-infection. \n\n\n\n109 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNovoRapid PumpCart 100 units/ml solution for injection in cartridge \nInsulin aspart \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use NovoRapid PumpCart  \n3. How to use NovoRapid PumpCart \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoRapid PumpCart \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoRapid PumpCart is and what it is used for \n \nNovoRapid is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin products \nare improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoRapid is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year \nand above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with NovoRapid helps to prevent \ncomplications from your diabetes. \n \nNovoRapid PumpCart is for use in a pump and covers your total daily insulin needs: both your all day \n(basal) and meal-time (bolus) insulin needs. Before you use NovoRapid PumpCart in the pump you \nmust have received a comprehensive instruction by your doctor or nurse.  \n \nBasal (all-day) insulin requirements: When you use NovoRapid PumpCart in a pump, your insulin \nwill be constantly delivered to cover your basal need for insulin. If you change the basal insulin setting \nthe change will start to affect you within 10â€“20 minutes. If you stop the pump, the insulin effect will \nlast for 3 to 5 hours. Before you set or change the basal rate, carefully read the pump manual (user \nguide). \n \nBolus (meal-time) insulin requirements: NovoRapid will start to lower your blood sugar within 10â€“\n20 minutes after you start a bolus delivery (see section 3, How to use NovoRapid PumpCart, for more \ninformation about how to adjust your bolus dose). The maximum effect occurs between 1 and 3 hours \nafter the bolus delivery and the effect lasts for 3 to 5 hours.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoRapid PumpCart \n \nDo not use NovoRapid PumpCart \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \n\n\n\n110 \n\nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see a) Summary of serious and very \ncommon side effects in section 4). \n\nâ–º If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see section 5, How to store NovoRapid \n\nPumpCart). \nâ–º If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.  \n \nIf any of these applies, do not use NovoRapid PumpCart. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \n\nfor advice. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid PumpCart \n \nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage or leakage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white \nlabel band at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be a result of leakage of insulin. If you \nsuspect the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. \n\nâ–º Infusion sets (tubing and needle) and NovoRapid PumpCart must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoRapid PumpCart is only suitable for injecting under the skin (subcutaneously) using a \n\npump. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nof your injections. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried \nout in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and NovoRapid PumpCart \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \n\n\n\n111 \n\nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. NovoRapid can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoRapid during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and \ntherefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger \nyourself or others. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of NovoRapid \n \nNovoRapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoRapid is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoRapid PumpCart \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your basal (all-day) and bolus (meal time) doses exactly as your \ndoctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your bolus \n(meal-time) insulin needs to be adjusted based on your blood sugar measurement and food intake. Eat \na meal or snack within 10 minutes of the bolus dose to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, you \ncan take the bolus dose just after you have finished eating.  \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nNovoRapid can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject  \n \nNovoRapid PumpCart is only suitable for injecting under the skin (subcutaneously) using a pump. \nNever inject directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Speak to your doctor if \nyou need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nBefore using NovoRapid PumpCart in a pump, you must have thorough training in the use of the \npump and information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, too high or too low blood sugar \nor failure of the pump. Follow your doctorâ€™s instructions and advice about the use of NovoRapid \nPumpCart in the pump.  \n \nNormally you will inject your insulin in the front of your waist (abdomen). Alternatively, if your \ndoctor recommends it, you may use your thigh or upper arm. When you change the infusion set \n(tubing and needle), be sure to change the site for inserting the needle (injection site). This may reduce \nthe risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). Changing the \ninfusion set must be done according to the instructions in the manual supplied with the infusion set.  \n \nWhen you are using an insulin pump \n \nIt is best to measure your blood sugar level regularly to get the maximum benefit of insulin delivery, \nand to make sure the pump is working properly. If you experience any problems contact your doctor.  \n \nâ–º NovoRapid PumpCart is only for use with a pump designed to be used with this cartridge, such \n\nas the Accu-Chek Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps. \nâ–º NovoRapid PumpCart is a pre-filled cartridge ready for use directly in the pump. Follow the \n\npump manual (user guide). \nâ–º To ensure correct dosing, NovoRapid PumpCart must not be used in an insulin pen. \nâ–º NovoRapid should never be mixed with any other medicinal product including other insulin \n\nproducts when used in a pump.  \nâ–º Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \nâ–º Always carry a spare NovoRapid PumpCart. \n \nRead carefully the instructions on how to use NovoRapid PumpCart included in this package leaflet. \n \nWhat to do in case of pump failure \n \nMake sure you have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under the \nskin (for example, a pen injector) in case the pump stops working. \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin  \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoRapid in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice) and adjust insulin delivery or stop your pump. Measure your blood sugar if \npossible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, \ncontinue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection \nof glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. \nThe amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \n\n\n\n114 \n\nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink due to risk of suffocation. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoRapid or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n115 \n\nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.
