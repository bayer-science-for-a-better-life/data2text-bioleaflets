This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDoptelet 20 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains avatrombopag maleate equivalent to 20 mg of avatrombopag. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 120.8 mg of lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nPale yellow, round biconvex film-coated 7.6 mm tablet debossed with \u201cAVA\u201d on one side and \u201c20\u201d on \nthe other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDoptelet is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver \ndisease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nObtain a platelet count prior to the administration of Doptelet therapy and on the day of a procedure to \nensure an adequate increase in platelet count, and no unexpectedly high increase in platelet count in \nthe patient populations specified in sections 4.4 and 4.5.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended daily dose of avatrombopag is based on the patient\u2019s platelet count (see Table 1). \nDosing should begin 10 to 13 days prior to the planned procedure. The patient should undergo their \nprocedure 5 to 8 days after the last dose of avatrombopag. \n \nTable 1 Daily dose recommendation for avatrombopag \n\nPlatelet count (x109/L) Once-daily dose Duration of dosing \n\n< 40 60 mg (Three 20 mg tablets) 5 days \n\n\u2265 40 to < 50 40 mg (Two 20 mg tablets) 5 days \n \nDuration of treatment \nDue to limited information, avatrombopag should not be taken for more than 5 days. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as it is remembered. Two doses should not be taken at \none time to make up for a missed dose. The next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nAvatrombopag is not renally excreted, therefore no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild \nor moderate renal impairment. Avatrombopag has not been studied in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2); however, given the short duration of treatment, no dose adjustment is \nrecommended. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) to moderate \n(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment.  \n \nDue to limited information available, the safety and efficacy of avatrombopag in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C, MELD score > 24) have not been established (see section \n4.4). No dosage adjustment is expected for these patients. Avatrombopag therapy should only be \ninitiated in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the expected benefit outweighs the expected \nrisks (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of avatrombopag in children aged less than 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nDoptelet is for oral use, and the tablets should be taken once daily with food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to avatrombopag or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThrombotic/thromboembolic events \n \nPatients with chronic liver disease are known to be at increased risk for thromboembolic events. Portal \nvein thrombosis has been reported at an increased frequency in patients with chronic liver disease who \nhad platelet counts > 200 x 109/L receiving a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (see section 4.8). \n \nDoptelet was not studied in patients with prior thromboembolic events. Consider the potential \nincreased thrombotic risk when administering Doptelet to patients with known risk factors for \nthromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, \nProthrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency). Doptelet should not be \nadministered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \n \nThere is limited information on the use of avatrombopag in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C, \nMELD score > 24) hepatic impairment. Avatrombopag should only be used in such patients if the \nexpected benefit outweighs the expected risks (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment should be supported in line with clinical practice by close \nmonitoring for early signs of worsening or new onset hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and thrombotic \nor bleeding tendency, through monitoring of liver function tests, tests used for assessing clotting status \nand through imaging of portal vasculature as needed. \n \nPatients with Child Pugh class C liver disease, should be evaluated on the day of the procedure for an \nunexpectedly high increase in platelet count. \n \nUse in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing invasive procedures \n \nThe objective of treatment with Doptelet is to increase platelet counts. While the benefit-risk profile \nfor procedures that were not specifically included in the clinical studies is likely to be comparable, the \nefficacy and safety of avatrombopag have not been established in major surgeries like laparotomy, \nthoracotomy, open-heart surgery, craniotomy or excision of organs. \n \nRetreatment \n \nThere is limited information on the use of avatrombopag in patients previously exposed to \navatrombopag. \n \nCo-administration with interferon preparations \n \nInterferon preparations have been known to reduce platelet counts, therefore, this should be considered \nwhen co-administering avatrombopag with interferon preparations. \n \nLactose \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nP-gp inhibitors \n \nConcomitant use of avatrombopag with P-gp inhibitors resulted in alterations in exposure that were \nnot clinically significant. No dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nCYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of avatrombopag with strong CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C9 inhibitors increases \navatrombopag exposure. The increase in avatrombopag exposure is not expected to have a clinically \nimportant effect on platelet counts due to the 5-day treatment duration, and no dose adjustment is \nrecommended. However, these patients should be evaluated on the day of the procedure for an \nunexpectedly high increase in platelet count (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nStrong CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C9 inducers \nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C9 inducers reduces avatrombopag exposure, and may \nresult in a decreased effect on platelet counts; however, no dose adjustment is recommended (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of avatrombopag in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Doptelet is not \nrecommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no data on the presence of avatrombopag in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, \nor the effects on milk production. It is unknown whether avatrombopag or its metabolites are excreted \nin human milk. Avatrombopag was present in the milk of lactating rats, see section 5.3. A risk to the \nbreast-feeding child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Doptelet therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of avatrombopag on human fertility has not been established. In animal studies, \navatrombopag had no effect on male and female fertility or early embryogenesis in rats (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDoptelet has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of avatrombopag was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, \nStudy 1 and Study 2, in which 430 patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia received \neither avatrombopag (n = 274) or placebo (n = 156), and had 1 post-dose safety assessment. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are classified by Preferred Term and System Organ Class, and by frequency. \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nSystem organ class \n(MedDRA terminology*) Common Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  Anaemia \nVascular disorders  Portal vein thrombosis \nMusculoskeletal & connective tissue \ndisorders  \n\nBone pain \nMyalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nFatigue Pyrexia \n\n* Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 19.1. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nThe most important treatment-emergent adverse reaction associated with avatrombopag was portal \nvein thrombosis. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was 1 treatment-emergent event \nof portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n = 1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia \nwhich was reported 14 days after treatment with Doptelet ended. This adverse reaction was assessed as \nnon-serious. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with avatrombopag. Should overdose occur or be suspected, \nDoptelet dosing should be stopped and platelet count should be carefully monitored since \navatrombopag increases platelet count in a dose-dependent fashion. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics, ATC code: B02BX08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAvatrombopag is an orally active, small molecule thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that \nstimulates proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells \nresulting in increased production of platelets. Avatrombopag does not compete with TPO for binding \nto the TPO receptor and has an additive effect with TPO on platelet production. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of avatrombopag for the treatment of adult patients with chronic liver disease \nand a platelet count \u02c2 50 x 109/L who were scheduled to undergo a procedure were studied in 2 \nidentically-designed multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies \n(Study 1 and Study 2). In each study, patients were assigned to the low baseline platelet count cohort \n(\u02c2 40 x 109/L) or the high baseline platelet count cohort (\u2265 40 to \u02c2 50 x 109/L) based on their platelet \ncount at baseline. Patients were then randomised 2:1 to either avatrombopag or placebo. \n \nPatients in the low baseline platelet count cohort received 60 mg avatrombopag or matching placebo \nonce daily for 5 days, and patients in the high baseline platelet count cohort received 40 mg \navatrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 5 days. Eligible patients were scheduled to undergo \ntheir procedure (low bleeding risk procedures, such as endoscopy and colonoscopy (60.8%); moderate \nbleeding risk, such as liver biopsy and chemoembolization for HCC (17.2%); or high bleeding risk, \nsuch as dental procedures and radiofrequency ablation (22.1%)) 5 to 8 days after their last dose of \ntreatment. Patient populations were similar between the low and high baseline platelet count cohorts, \nand consisted of 66% male and 35% female; median age 58 years and 61% White, 34% Asian, and 3% \nBlack. A total of 24.8% of patients were \u2265 65 years of age, 4.6% \u2265 75 years of age, and only 1 \n(0.2%) \u2265 85 years of age. Patients\u2019 MELD scores ranged from < 10 (37.5%), 10 to 14 (46.3%) and \nfrom > 14 to < 24 (16.2%), and included patients with CTP Class A (56.4%), Class B (38.1%), and \nClass C (5.6%). \n \nIn Study 1, a total of 231 patients were randomised; 149 patients to the avatrombopag group and \n82 patients to the placebo group. In the low baseline platelet count cohort, the mean baseline platelet \ncount for the avatrombopag-treated group was 31.1 x 109/L and for placebo-treated patients was \n30.7 x 109/L. In the high baseline platelet count cohort, the mean baseline platelet count for the \navatrombopag-treated patients was 44.3 x 109/L and for placebo-treated patients was 44.9 x 109/L. \n \nIn Study 2, a total of 204 patients were randomised; 128 patients to the avatrombopag treatment group \nand 76 patients to the placebo treatment group. In the low baseline platelet count cohort, the mean \nbaseline platelet count for the avatrombopag-treated group was 32.7 x 109/L and for placebo-treated \npatients was 32.5 x 109/L. In the high baseline platelet count cohort, the mean baseline platelet count \nfor the avatrombopag-treated patients was 44.3 x 109/L and for placebo-treated patients was \n44.5 x 109/L. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nResponders were defined as patients who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure \nfor bleeding after randomisation and up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure. Results are shown \nin Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Efficacy results by baseline platelet count cohort and treatment group \u2013 Study 1 and \n\nStudy 2 \nLow baseline platelet count cohort (< 40 x 109/L) \n\nCategory \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \n\nPlacebo \n \n\n(n = 48) \n\nAvatrombopag \n60 mg \n\n(n = 90) \n\nPlacebo \n \n\n(n = 43) \n\nAvatrombopag \n60 mg \n\n(n = 70) \nProportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding \n\nResponders \n95% CIa \n\n23% \n(11, 35) \n\n66% \n(56, 75) \n\n35% \n(21, 49) \n\n69% \n(58, 79) \n\nP-valueb \u02c2 0.0001 0.0006 \nProportion of subjects who achieved a platelet count \u2265 50 \u00d7 109/L on procedure day \n\nResponders \n95% CIa \n\n4% \n(0, 10) \n\n69% \n(59, 79) \n\n7% \n(0, 15) \n\n67% \n(56, 78) \n\nP-valueb \u02c2 0.0001 \u02c2 0.0001 \nChange in platelet count from baseline to procedure day \n\nMean (SD) x 109/L 0.8 (6.4) 32.0 (25.5) 3.0 (10.0) 31.3 (24.1) \nMedian x 109/L 0.5 28.3 0.5 28.0 \n\nP-valuec \u02c2 0.0001 \u02c2 0.0001 \n   \n\nHigh baseline platelet count (\u2265 40 to < 50 x 109/L) \n\nCategory \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nPlacebo \n\n \n(n = 34) \n\nAvatrombopag \n40 mg \n\n(n = 59) \n\nPlacebo \n \n\n(n = 33) \n\nAvatrombopag \n40 mg \n\n(n = 58) \n\nProportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding \nResponders \n95% CIa \n\n38% \n(22, 55) \n\n88% \n(80, 96) \n\n33% \n(17, 49) \n\n88% \n(80, 96) \n\nP-valueb \u02c2 0.0001 \u02c2 0.0001 \nProportion of subjects who achieved a platelet count \u2265 50 \u00d7 109/L on procedure day \n\nResponders \n95% CIa \n\n21% \n(7, 34) \n\n88% \n(80, 96) \n\n39% \n(23, 56) \n\n93% \n(87, 100) \n\nP-valueb \u02c2 0.0001 \u02c2 0.0001 \nChange in platelet count from baseline to procedure day \n\nMean (SD) x 109/L 1.0 (9.3) 37.1 (27.4) 5.9 (14.9) 44.9 (33.0) \nMedian x 109/L 0.0 33.0 3.3 41.3 \n\nP-valuec \u02c2 0.0001 \u02c2 0.0001 \n\na Two-sided 95% confidence interval based on normal approximation. \nb Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test. \nc Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. \n\n \nA measured increase in platelet counts was observed in both avatrombopag treatment groups over time \nbeginning on Day 4 post-dose, which peaked on Day 10-13 and then returned to near baseline values \n\n\n\n8 \n\nby Day 35 (Figure 1); mean platelet count remained greater than or equal to 50 x 109/L on Day 17 \n(Visit 5). \n \nFigure 1: Mean platelet count (+/- standard error) by days from start of dosing by baseline \nplatelet count cohort and treatment group - pooled Study 1 and Study 2 \n\n \n\n \n \nThe efficacy of avatrombopag was similar across various subgroups for the pooled Phase 3 study \npopulation (Study 1 and Study 2). The proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or any \nrescue procedure for bleeding was generally similar across the various subgroups. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDoptelet in all subsets of the paediatric population in thrombocytopenia secondary to liver disease (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe plasma concentration-time profiles following the oral administration of avatrombopag were \ncharacterised by a short lag time (0.5 \u2013 0.75 hours) with peak exposure at 6 \u2013 8 hours post dose. In a \nmultiple-dose pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, steady state was reached by day 5 of \ndosing. Open label, randomised, cross-over replicate design clinical trials were conducted in healthy \nsubjects to assess the effects of high-fat and low-fat food on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic \nvariability of avatrombopag. Administration with either type of food did not have any clinically \nimportant effects on rate (Cmax) or extent (AUC) of avatrombopag exposure. However, there was a \nsignificant reduction (by approximately 50%) in the between- and within-subject variability of \navatrombopag AUC and Cmax when administered with food (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nFood interaction \n \nCo-administration of avatrombopag with either a high-fat or low-fat meal did not result in clinically \nimportant changes in rate or extent of absorption of avatrombopag. However, administration of \navatrombopag with both a high- and low-fat meal reduced inter-subject and intra-subject \npharmacokinetic variability of avatrombopag by approximately 50%. Therefore, avatrombopag is \nrecommended to be administered with food (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro studies suggest that avatrombopag is highly bound to human plasma proteins (> 96%). The \napparent volume of distribution of avatrombopag in patients with thrombocytopenia and chronic liver \ndisease based on population pharmacokinetic analysis is approximately 180 L, suggesting that \navatrombopag is extensively distributed. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe oxidative metabolism of avatrombopag is mainly mediated by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. \nAvatrombopag is a substrate for p-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated transport, although no clinically \nimportant differences in platelet count elevations are expected when avatrombopag is co-administered \nwith a strong P-gp inhibitor. Based on in vitro studies, no other transporting proteins (OATP1B1, \nOATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3) are expected to play a significant role in the disposition of \navatrombopag. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nTable 3: Drug interactions: Changes in pharmacokinetics of avatrombopag in the presence of \nco-administered drug  \n\nCo-administered drug* \n\nGeometric mean ratio \n[90% CI] of avatrombopag PK with/without \n\nco administered drug (No Effect = 1.00) \n\nAUC0-inf Cmax \n\nStrong CYP3A inhibitor \n\nItraconazole 1.37 (1.10, 1.72) \n1.07 \n\n(0.86, 1.35) \n\nModerate CYP3A and CYP2C9 inhibitor \n\nFluconazole 2.16 (1.71, 2.72) \n1.17 \n\n(0.96, 1.42) \n\nModerate CYP2C9 and strong CYP3A inducer \n\nRifampin 0.57 (0.47, 0.62) \n1.04 \n\n(0.88, 1.23) \n\nP-gp inhibitor \n\nCyclosporine 0.83 (0.65, 1.04) \n0.66 \n\n(0.54, 0.82) \n\nP-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitor \n\nVerapamil 1.61 (1.21, 2.15) \n1.26 \n\n(0.96, 1.66) \n* at steady state, except for cyclosporine which was administered as a single dose \n\n \nEffect of avatrombopag \nAvatrombopag does not inhibit CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1, or CYP3A, does not induce CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C, and CYP3A, and weakly induces \nCYP2C8 and CYP2C9 in vitro. \n \nAvatrombopag inhibits organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3 and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP) but not organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, and organic cation \ntransporter (OCT) 2 in vitro. \n \nEffect of transporting proteins \nAvatrombopag is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated transport (see Table 3). \nAvatrombopag is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe predominant route of avatrombopag excretion is via faeces. Following administration of a single \n20 mg 14C-avatrombopag dose to healthy male volunteers, 88% of the dose was recovered in faeces \nand 6% in urine. Of the 88% of drug-related material in the faeces, 77% was identified as parent \n(34%) and the 4-hydroxy metabolite (44%). No metabolites of avatrombopag were detected in plasma. \n \nThe mean plasma elimination half-life (%CV) of avatrombopag is approximately 19 hours (19%). The \nmean (%CV) of the clearance of avatrombopag is estimated to be 6.9 L/hr (29%). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nLinearity \n \nAvatrombopag demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after single doses from 10 mg \n(0.25-times the lowest approved dosage) to 80 mg (1.3-times the highest recommended dosage). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of avatrombopag plasma concentrations from clinical studies \nwith healthy subjects and patients with thrombocytopenia due to chronic liver disease, that included \n11% (84/787) of the study population \u2265 65 years of age, suggested that avatrombopag exposures are \nnot affected by age (see section 4.2). \n \nRacial or Ethnic Groups \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of avatrombopag plasma concentrations from the clinical studies \nwith healthy subjects and patients with thrombocytopenia due to chronic liver disease indicated that \navatrombopag exposures were similar across the different races studied. \n \nRenal impairment \nHuman studies demonstrated that the renal route is not a major pathway for either unchanged \navatrombopag or its metabolite\u2019s elimination. Based on the known metabolic profile of avatrombopag \nand the fact that only 6% of the dose is excreted in urine, the likelihood of effects of renal impairment \non pharmacokinetics of avatrombopag is considered to be very low (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis of avatrombopag in healthy subjects and subjects with \nthrombocytopenia due to chronic liver disease indicated similar exposures between healthy subjects \nand subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (CrCL \u2265 30 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault). \n \nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of avatrombopag have not been investigated in patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault) including patients requiring \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis evaluated avatrombopag plasma exposures in patients with \nmild to moderate hepatic impairment based on Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores \nand Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores. No clinically important difference in avatrombopag exposures were \nobserved between patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh Scores (Range = 5 to 12) or MELD scores \n(Range = 4 to 23) and healthy subjects. Avatrombopag plasma exposure was comparable in patients \nwith chronic liver disease secondary to viral hepatitis (n = 242), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (n = 45) \nand alcoholic liver disease (n = 49) in the pivotal Phase 3 studies, and also comparable to that in \nhealthy subjects (n = 391). Due to the limited information available, avatrombopag should only be \nused in Child-Pugh class C patients when the expected benefit outweighs the expected risks. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAvatrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats, monkeys, or dogs because of the \nunique TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animal studies do not fully model \npotential adverse effects related to platelet count increases due to avatrombopag in humans. \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. The primary toxicity of \navatrombopag in pivotal repeated-dose studies was in the stomach at high doses with adequate safety \nmargins when compared to the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose; these effects \nwere reversible even in the chronic toxicity studies. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nCarcinogenesis \n \nIn two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, neuroendocrine cell (enterochromaffin-like cell, \nECL cell) gastric tumours (carcinoids) occurred in the stomach at high doses. The gastric carcinoids \nwere considered likely due to prolonged hypergastrinemia observed in toxicity studies. \nHypergastrinemia-related gastric carcinoids in rodents are generally considered to be of low risk or \nrelevance to humans. \n \nAvatrombopag was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (AMES) assay or \nclastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations assay or in an in vivo rat bone \nmarrow micronucleus assay. \n \nAnimal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology \n \nIn 4-week or longer repeated-dose toxicity studies, treatment-related gastric lesions were observed in \nmice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. In these species, avatrombopag was associated with \nhistopathologic changes in the fundic mucosa of the glandular stomach, characterised by degeneration \nof the glandular epithelium with a decrease in matured parietal cells. This effect was not associated \nwith inflammatory response or any evidence of erosion or ulcer formation. The severity of gastric \nlesions was dependent on the dose and duration of avatrombopag administration and showed a clear \ntrend towards reversibility during the recovery period. The exposures (AUC) at doses that showed no \ngastric lesions across the species were 3- to 33-fold higher than the exposures in humans at the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \n \nReproductive and Developmental Toxicity \n \nAvatrombopag did not affect fertility or early embryonic development in male rats at exposures \n22-times, or in female rats at exposures 114-times, the AUC observed in patients at the recommended \ndose of 60 mg once daily. \n \nExcretion in Milk \n \nAvatrombopag was present in milk of lactating rats after oral administration of radioactive labeled \navatrombopag. The pharmacokinetic parameters of avatrombopag in milk were similar to those in \nplasma with an exposure ratio of avatrombopag-related radioactivity (milk to plasma) of 0.94. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Doptelet \n3. How to take Doptelet \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Doptelet \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Doptelet is and what it is used for \n \nDoptelet contains an active substance called avatrombopag. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nthrombopoietin receptor agonists. \n \nDoptelet is used in adults with chronic liver disease to treat low platelet count (called \nthrombocytopenia) before having a medical procedure where there is a risk of bleeding. \n \nDoptelet works by helping to increase the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are blood cells \nthat help the blood to clot and so reduce or prevent bleeding. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Doptelet \n \nDo not take Doptelet if: \n- you are allergic to avatrombopag or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Doptelet. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Doptelet if: \n- you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or members of your family have had \n\nblood clots. \n \nYou may be at higher risk of blood clots as you get older or if: \n- you have had to stay in bed for a long time \n- you have cancer \n- you are taking the contraceptive birth control pill or hormone replacement therapy \n- you have recently had surgery or been injured \n\n\n\n23 \n\n- you are very overweight \n- you smoke  \n- you have advanced chronic liver disease. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nDoptelet. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give Doptelet to people less than 18 years old. The safety and effectiveness of this medicine in \nthis age group is not known. \n \nOther medicines and Doptelet  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Doptelet is not recommended in pregnancy and in \nwomen who are able to have children and are not using contraception. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking Doptelet. This \nmedicine can pass into breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide whether the benefit of \nbreast-feeding outweighs any possible risks to your baby while you are breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDoptelet is not expected to affect you being able to drive, cycle or use tools or machines. \n \nDoptelet contains lactose \nDoptelet contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Doptelet \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. You should be scheduled to undergo your procedure 5 to 8 days after \nthe last dose of Doptelet. \n \nHow much to take \n\u2022 Doptelet is available in 20 mg tablets. The usual recommended dose is either 40 mg (2 tablets) or \n\n60 mg (3 tablets) every day for 5 days in a row. \n\u2022 Your dose will depend on your platelet counts. \n\u2022 Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many tablets to take and when to take them. \n\n \nTaking this medicine \n\u2022 Start taking Doptelet 10 to 13 days before your planned medical procedure. \n\u2022 Swallow the tablets whole, once daily with food. \n \nIf you take more Doptelet than you should \n\u2022 Talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away. \n \nIf you forget to take Doptelet \n\u2022 Take your missed dose as soon as you remember, then take your next dose at the usual time. \n\u2022 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIf you stop taking Doptelet \nTake Doptelet for as long as your doctor tells you. Do not stop taking Doptelet unless your doctor tells \nyou to. \n \nIf you have any questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
