PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \nClear, colourless, solution. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nAlpivab is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in adults and children from the age \nof 2 years (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPosology \n\nAlpivab should be administered as a single intravenous dose within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms \nof influenza. \n\nThe recommended single intravenous dose of peramivir depends on age and body weight as shown in \nTable 1. \n\nTable 1: Peramivir dose based on age and body weight \n\nAge and body weight Recommended single dose \n\nChildren aged from 2 years and <50 kg 12 mg/kg \n\nChildren aged from 2 years and \u226550 kg body weight 600 mg \n\nAdults and adolescents (13 years and older) 600 mg \n\nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nThe dose should be reduced for adults and adolescents (13 years and older) with absolute glomerular \nfiltration rate (GFR) below 50 mL/min as shown in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nTable 2: Peramivir dose for adults and adolescents (from 13 years and 50 kg) based on absolute \n\nGFR \nAbsolute Glomerular Filtration Rate \n\n(GFR)* Recommended single dose \n\n\u226550 600 mg \n30 to 49 300 mg \n10 to 29 200 mg \n\n*Absolute GFR not adjusted for body surface area \n \nIn adults and adolescents (from 13 years and 50 kg) with chronic renal impairment maintained on \nhaemodialysis, peramivir should be administered after dialysis at a dose adjusted for renal function \n(Table 2). \n \nThere are insufficient clinical data available in children and adolescents aged less than 13 years or \nwith body weight less than 50 kg with renal impairment to be able to make any dosing \nrecommendation. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of peramivir in children aged under 2 years has not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n  \nAlpivab is administered via intravenous infusion for 15 to 30 minutes.  \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with peramivir (see section 4.8). If any \nhypersensitivity reaction occurs during infusion of peramivir, the infusion must be stopped \nimmediately and appropriate management should be instituted. \n \nNeuropsychiatric events \n \nDelirium, hallucinations and abnormal behaviour have been reported in patients with influenza who \nwere receiving peramivir. These events were reported primarily among paediatric patients and often \nhad an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of peramivir to these events has not been \nestablished. Patients with influenza should be closely monitored for signs of abnormal behaviour.  \n \nReduced renal function \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nAcute renal failure, renal failure, pre-renal failure, renal disorder, anuria, nephritis, and increased \nblood creatinine have been reported in patients with influenza who were receiving peramivir. Most of \nthe cases occurred in elderly patients with comorbidities and multiple concomitant medicinal products. \nThe contribution of peramivir to these events has not been established. Patients with influenza and \nalready existing diseases should be closely monitored for renal function. \n\nLimitations of the clinical data \n\nThe efficacy of peramivir as a single dose treatment for uncomplicated influenza was demonstrated in a \nsingle placebo-controlled study conducted in 300 adult patients in Japan during the 2007/2008 influenza \nseason. The recommended 600 mg single intravenous dose resulted in shortening of the median time to \nalleviation of symptoms by 21 hours (see section 5.1). \n\nAvailable data do not support a conclusion that peramivir is effective in patients with influenza B or in \npatients with complicated influenza. \n\nResistance to peramivir \n\nInfluenza A/H1N1 viruses that contain the H275Y mutation have reduced susceptibility to peramivir \nand oseltamivir. In a clinical trial, no statistically significant clinical benefit could be demonstrated for \nperamivir over placebo in patients infected with the A/H1N1 virus containing the H275Y mutation. \nAvailable information on influenza drug susceptibility should be taken into account when deciding \nwhether to use peramivir (see section 5.1).  \n\nRisk of bacterial infections \n\nThere is no evidence for efficacy of peramivir in any illness caused by agents other than influenza \nviruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or \noccur as complications during the course of influenza. Peramivir has not been shown to prevent such \ncomplications.  \n\nExcipients \n\nThis medicinal product contains 212.4 mg sodium per 3 vials, equivalent to 10.6% of the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nThe potential for interactions of peramivir with other medicines is low, based on the known \nelimination pathway of peramivir.  \n\nLive attenuated influenza vaccines are not recommended to be used until 48 hours following Alpivab \nadministration due to a theoretical risk that peramivir could reduce the immunogenicity of the vaccine. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancies outcomes) from the use of peramivir \nin pregnant women.  \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).  \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of peramivir during pregnancy. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of peramivir in milk \n(see section 5.3). \n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nperamivir therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n\nFertility \n\nNo human data on the effect of peramivir on fertility are available. Peramivir had no effects on mating \nor fertility in animal studies (see section 5.3).  \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nPeramivir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most important serious adverse reactions associated with peramivir in patients are anaphylaxis and \nskin reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.  \nAmong 467 adult subjects with uncomplicated influenza who received a single intravenous dose of \nperamivir 600 mg in clinical trials, the most commonly observed adverse reactions were neutrophil \ncount decreased (3.2 %) and nausea (2.4 %).  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1000 to \n<1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions in studies investigating peramivir for treatment of uncomplicated \ninfluenza in adults  \n\nSystem Organ Class \n(SOC) \n\nAdverse Reaction According to Frequency* \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Unknown\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nneutrophil count \ndecreased \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nanaphylactic \nreaction*, \nanaphylactic \nshock* \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem Organ Class \n(SOC) \n\nAdverse Reaction According to Frequency* \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Unknown \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nblood lactate \ndehydrogenase \nincreased \n\ndecreased appetite, blood \nalbumin decreased, blood \nchloride increased, blood \nglucose decreased, blood \nlactate dehydrogenase \ndecreased, blood potassium \nincreased, blood sodium \nincreased, blood uric acid \nincreased, protein total \nincreased \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders   insomnia   \n\nabnormal \nbehaviour*, \ndelirium* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders   hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia     \n\nEye disorders   vision blurred     \n\nCardiac disorders   electrocardiogram QT prolonged     \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders nausea, vomiting \n\nabdominal pain upper, \nabdominal discomfort, \ngastritis \n\n    \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders   \n\nincreased gamma-\nglutamyltransferase   \n\nliver disorder*, \nalanine \naminotransferase \nincreased*, \naspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased*  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  dermatitis, drug eruption, eczema, urticaria \nerythema \nmultiforme \n\ndermatitis \nexfoliative*, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome* \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  arthralgia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased     \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders   \n\nblood urea increased, blood \npresent in urine, urobilin \npresent in urine, blood \ncreatinine increased, urine \nketone body increased \n\n  \nacute kidney \ninjury*, renal \nimpairment* \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\n  chest discomfort, fatigue     \n\n*These events reported from post-authorization use occurred with different dosage and dosing \nschedule to that described in the SmPC. \n\n \nPaediatrics \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn paediatric subjects (age 2 to 17 years) with uncomplicated influenza enrolled in a clinical trial, the \nsafety profile of peramivir was similar to that reported in adults. Common adverse reactions not \nreported in adults were injection site rash, pyrexia, tympanic membrane hyperaemia, psychomotor \nhyperactivity, and pruritus.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience of acute overdose with peramivir in humans. Treatment of an overdose should \nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.  \n \nPeramivir is cleared by renal excretion and can be cleared by haemodialysis. There is no specific \nantidote to treat an overdose of this medicine. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, neuraminidase inhibitors ATC code:  \nJ05AH03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPeramivir is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, an enzyme that releases viral particles from \nthe plasma membrane of infected cells and is also important for viral entry into uninfected cells, which \ncauses further spread of infectious virus in the body. \n \nIn-vitro activity  \n \nNeuraminidase inhibition occurred at very low peramivir concentrations in-vitro, with median \ninhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values of 0.13 nanomolar (nM) to 0.99 nM against influenza A \nand B strains. \n \nResistance \nIn a clinical trial in which 245 subjects were infected at baseline with influenza A/H1N1 containing \nthe H275Y mutation, the median baseline IC50 values for peramivir, oseltamivir and zanamivir were \n51.0 nM, 487.6 nM and 0.95 nM, respectively.  \n \nIn clinical trials, H275Y was the only resistance-associated treatment-emergent mutation in the \nneuraminidase gene that occurred in virus obtained from more than one peramivir-treated subject (in 9 \nof 481[1.9 %] infected with the A/H1N1 influenza virus).  \n \nCross resistance \nThe H275Y substitution is associated with reduced susceptibility to peramivir and oseltamivir. Cross-\nresistance between peramivir and each of oseltamivir and zanamivir may also occur.  \n \nClinical studies \n \nUncomplicated influenza in adults \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nA randomised, multicentre, double-blind trial conducted in Japan evaluated a single intravenous \nadministration of peramivir 300 mg or 600 mg, or placebo administered over 30 minutes in subjects 20 \nto 64 years of age with uncomplicated influenza. Subjects were eligible if they had fever greater than \n38 \u00b0C and a positive rapid antigen test for influenza virus, accompanied by at least two of the \nfollowing symptoms: cough, nasal symptoms, sore throat, myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue or \nheadache.  \n\nStudy treatment was started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects participating in the trial \nwere required to self-assess their influenza symptoms as \u201cnone\u2019, \u2018mild\u2019, \u2018moderate\u2019 or \u2018severe\u2019 twice \ndaily. The primary endpoint, time to alleviation of symptoms, was defined as the number of hours \nfrom initiation of study drug until the start of the 24 hour period in which all seven symptoms of \ninfluenza (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, feverishness, myalgia and fatigue) were \neither absent or present at a level no greater than mild for at least 21.5 hours. \n\nThe intent to treat influenza population (ITTI) included 296 subjects with influenza confirmed by \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the 97 subjects enrolled in the peramivir 600 mg dose \ngroup, 99 % were infected with influenza A virus (subtypes H1 and H3; 71 % and 26 %, respectively) \nand 1 % with influenza B virus. At enrollment 85 % of the 296 subjects had a composite influenza \nsymptom score <15. The mean temperature at enrolment was 38.6 \u00b0C (axillary). Key efficacy results \nare presented in Table 4. \n\nTable 4: Key efficacy results from study 0722T0621 (ITTI Population)  \nPeramivir 600 mg  \n\nn=97 \nPlacebo  \nn=100 \n\nTime to alleviation of symptoms \nmedian (hours) \n(95 % CI) \n\n59.9 \n(54.4, 68.1) \n\n81.8 \n(68.0, 101.5) \n\nTime to recovery of normal temperature \nmedian (hours) \n(95 % CI) \n\n30.2 \n(25.9, 31.9) \n\n42.4 \n(32.9, 46.5) \n\nCI = Confidence Interval \n\nUncomplicated influenza in paediatric subjects aged 2-17 years \nThe safety of peramivir was evaluated in a randomised, active-controlled study of 110 subjects with \nuncomplicated influenza who received open label treatment with a single dose of peramivir (600 mg \nfor subjects 13 to 17 years of age and 12 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 600 mg in subjects 2 to \n12 years of age) or oral oseltamivir administered twice daily for 5 days. The ITTI population included \n84 subjects with influenza confirmed by PCR. Among the 93 subjects enrolled in the peramivir dose \ngroup, 43% were infected with influenza A virus (subtypes H1 and H3; 54 % and 46 %, respectively) \nand 27% with influenza B virus. Randomisation was 4:1 for peramivir and oseltamivir. Treatment was \ngiven or commenced within 48 hours of onset of symptoms of influenza. Efficacy (time to resolution \nof fever; time to resolution of influenza symptoms, viral shedding, virus susceptibility) was a \nsecondary endpoint. \n\nSubjects receiving peramivir experienced a median time to alleviation of their combined influenza \nsymptoms of 79.0 hours and the median time to recovery to normal temperature (less than 37 \u00b0C) was \napproximately 40.0 hours. \n\nElderly patients \nClinical trials in which single intravenous doses of peramivir were administered to patients with \nuncomplicated influenza included few subjects aged 65 and over (n=10). \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAlpivab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of influenza (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous (IV) administration of peramivir (0.17 to \n2 times the recommended dose) showed a linear relationship between dose and exposure parameters \n(maximum serum concentration [Cmax] and area under the curve [AUC]). Following intravenous \nadministration of a single dose of peramivir 600 mg over 30 minutes, Cmax was reached at the end of \ninfusion.  \n \nDistribution \n \nIn-vitro binding of peramivir to human plasma proteins is less than 30 %.  \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume of distribution was 12.56 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPeramivir is not significantly metabolised in humans. \n \nElimination \n \nThe elimination half-life of peramivir following IV administration to healthy subjects of 600 mg as a \nsingle dose is approximately 20 hours. The major route of elimination of peramivir is via the kidney. \nRenal clearance of unchanged peramivir accounts for approximately 90 % of total clearance. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRace \nIn simulations of a single dose of 600 mg, the predicted AUC in Asians (AUC0-24 88,800 ng\u2022h/mL) \nwas slightly higher as compared to Non-Asians (AUC0-24 77,200 ng\u2022h/mL).   \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of peramivir following a 600 mg intramuscular (IM) injection was similar in \nmales and females with AUC0-\u221e of 76,600 ng\u2022hr/mL and 101,000 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively, and Cmax of \n27,760 ng/mL and 34,710 ng/mL, respectively. \n \nPaediatrics \nThe pharmacokinetics of peramivir has been evaluated in a study in paediatric subjects 2 to 17 years of \nage with uncomplicated influenza. Pharmacokinetic sampling in this study was limited to \napproximately 3 hours after administration of peramivir. Pharmacokinetics of peramivir in subjects 2 \nto 17 years of age (administered 12 mg/kg or 600 mg according to age and body weight) and in \nhealthy adults (administered 600 mg) was similar (Table 5).  \n \nTable 5: Pharmacokinetic parameters in paediatric subjects  \n\nAge Group  N Cmax (ng/mL) AUClast (ng\u2022h/mL) \n\n2 years - <7 years \nMean (SD) 28 53,600 (26,200) 74,000 (30,000) \n\nGeometric Mean  47,400 68,100 \n%CV  48.9 40.6 \n\n7 years - <13 years \nMean (SD) 39 66,800 (35,400) 87,000 (40,800) \n\nGeometric Mean  61200 81,000 \n%CV  53.0 46.8 \n\n13 years - <18 Mean (SD) 20 54,300 (17,900) 72,400 (20,000) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nGeometric Mean 51,500 69,500 \n%CV 33.0 27.6\n\n2 years - <18 years \nMean (SD) 87 59,700 (29,700) 79,500 (34,000) \n\nGeometric Mean 54,200 74,000 \n%CV 49.8 42.7\n\nSD = Standard Deviation; CV = Coefficient of Variation \n\nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of peramivir was evaluated in 20 elderly subjects (>65 years of age) following a \nsingle 4 mg/kg IV dose of peramivir. The elderly subjects enrolled were aged 65 to 79 years, with a \nmean age of 70.1 years, with creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault calculation) CrClcg ranging from \n82.8 mL/min to 197.9 mL/min. The pharmacokinetics in elderly subjects was similar to non-elderly \nsubjects. Mean peak concentrations of peramivir were approximately 10 % higher in elderly subjects \nfollowing administration of a single dose when compared to young adults (22,647 vs. 20,490 ng/mL, \nrespectively). Exposure (AUC0-12) to peramivir following a single dose was approximately 33 % \nhigher in elderly subjects compared to young adults (61,334 vs. 46,200 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively). \n\nRenal impairment \nIn a study in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment and subjects with normal renal \nfunction, a single 2 mg/kg IV dose of peramivir was administered. Serum creatinine measurements \nwere used to calculate creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault equation). The mean AUC0-\uf0b5 was \nincreased by 28 %, 302 % and 412 % in subjects with creatinine clearance of 50-79, 30-49 and 10-29 \nmL/min, respectively. Haemodialysis initiated at 2 hours after dosing reduced systemic exposure of \nperamivir by 73 to 81 %. \n\nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of peramivir in subjects with hepatic impairment has not been studied. No \nclinically relevant alterations to peramivir pharmacokinetics are expected in patients with hepatic \nimpairment based on the route of peramivir elimination. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nPeramivir was not teratogenic in embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits and had no \neffects on mating or fertility in rats up to 600 mg/kg/day, at which exposures were approximately \n8-fold of those in humans at the clinically recommended dose. However, in an embryo-foetal\ndevelopment study in rats, in which dams received continuous infusions of peramivir from day 6-17 of\ngestation at doses of 50, 400 or 1000 mg/kg/day, dose related increases in the incidences of reduction\nof the renal papillae and dilatation of the ureters were observed. The teratological importance of these\nfindings is unclear.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies by intravenous injection of peramivir were not performed.  \n\nPeramivir was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in-vitro and in-vivo assays. \n\nAcute renal necrosis was found in rabbits at doses \u2265 200 mg/kg with a clear no observed adverse effect \nlevel (NOAEL) established in multiple studies at 100 mg/kg/day.  \n\nTwo-week oral toxicity studies were conducted in juvenile rats and rabbits, and a four-week IV \ntoxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats. In general, nephrotoxicity was observed in rabbits, no \nunexpected toxicity was observed, and no other target organ toxicity was identified in juvenile \nanimals. \n\n6.
