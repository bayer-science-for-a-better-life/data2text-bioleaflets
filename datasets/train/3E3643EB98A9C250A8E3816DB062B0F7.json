PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solution for solution for injection (powder and solution for injection). \nThe powder is a white to off- white cake. \nThe solution is a colourless clear solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMenveo is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults \nat risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nChildren (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults \n \nMenveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 ml). \nTo ensure optimal antibody levels against all vaccine serogroups, the primary vaccination schedule \nwith Menveo should be completed one month prior to risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis \ngroups A, C, W-135 and Y. Bactericidal antibodies (hSBA\u22651:8) were observed in at least 64% of \nsubjects at 1 week post vaccination (see section 5.1 for immunogenicity data per individual \nserogroups). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nOlder people \n \nThere are limited data in individuals aged 56-65 and there are no data in individuals aged >65 years. \n \nBooster vaccination \n \nLong-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Menveo are available up to 5 years \nafter vaccination (see section 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMenveo may be given as a booster dose in subjects who have previously received primary vaccination \nwith Menveo, other conjugated meningococcal vaccine or meningococcal unconjugated \npolysaccharide vaccine. The need for and timing of a booster dose in subjects previously vaccinated \nwith Menveo is to be defined based on national recommendations. \n \nPaediatric population (under 2 years of age) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Menveo in children under 2 years of age has not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMenveo is given as an intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid muscle. \nIt must not be administered intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. \n \nSeparate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is being administered at the same time. \n \nFor instructions on preparation and reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, \nsee section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or diphtheria \ntoxoid (CRM197), or a life-threatening reaction after previous administration of a vaccine containing \nsimilar components (see section 4.4). \n \nAs with other vaccines, Menveo should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe \nfebrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n \nBefore the injection of any vaccine, the person responsible for administration must take all precautions \nknown for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions including thorough medical history and \ncurrent health status. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision \nmust always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following administration of the \nvaccine. \n \nAnxiety\u2010related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress\u2010related \nreactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection \n(see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from \nfainting. \n \nMenveo should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nMenveo will not protect against infections caused by any other serogroups of N. meningitidis not \npresent in the vaccine. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nAs with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees \n(see section 5.1). \n \nStudies with Menveo have shown a waning of serum bactericidal antibody titers against serogroup A \nwhen using human complement in the assay (hSBA) (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of the \nwaning of hSBA serogroup A antibody titers is unknown. If an individual is expected to be at \nparticular risk of exposure to Men A and received a dose of Menveo more than approximately one \nyear previously, consideration may be given to administering a booster dose. \n \nThere are no data on the applicability of the vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis. \n \nIn immunocompromised individuals, vaccination may not result in an appropriate protective antibody \nresponse. While Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is not a contraindication, Menveo \nhas not been specifically evaluated in immunocompromised people. Individuals with complement \ndeficiencies and individuals with functional or anatomical asplenia may not mount an immune \nresponse to meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccines. \n \nIndividuals with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C3 or C5 deficiencies) and \nindividuals receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, \neculizumab) are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, \nW-135 and Y, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with Menveo. \n \nMenveo has not been evaluated in persons with thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders or that are \nreceiving anticoagulant therapy, because of the risk of haematoma. The risk-benefit ratio for persons \nat risk of haematoma following intramuscular injection must be evaluated by health care professionals. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMenveo can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: monovalent and combined \nhepatitis A and B, yellow fever, typhoid fever (Vi polysaccharide), Japanese encephalitis, rabies and \nmeningococcal group B (Bexsero). \n \nIn adolescents (11 to 18 years of age), Menveo has been evaluated in two co-administration studies \nwith either Tetanus, Reduced Diphtheria and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Tdap) alone or \nTdap and Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant \n(HPV), both of which support the co-administration of the vaccines. \n \nThere was no evidence of an increased rate of reactogenicity or change in the safety profile of the \nvaccines in either study. Antibody responses to Menveo and the diphtheria, tetanus or HPV vaccine \ncomponents were not negatively affected by co-administration. \n \nThe administration of Menveo one month after Tdap resulted in statistically significantly lower \nserogroup W-135 seroresponses. Since there was no direct impact on the seroprotection rate, \nthe clinical consequences are presently unknown. There was evidence of some suppression of antibody \nresponse to two of the three pertussis antigens. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. \nAfter vaccination, over 97% of subjects had detectable pertussis titers to all three pertussis antigens. \n \nFor children 2 to 10 years of age, no data are available for evaluating safety and immunogenicity \nof other childhood vaccines when administered concomitantly with Menveo. \n \nConcomitant administration of Menveo and other vaccines than those listed above has not been \nstudied. Concomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably \n\n\n\n5 \n\ncontralateral. It should be checked if the adverse reactions may be intensified by any \nco-administration. \n \nIf a vaccine recipient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment, the immunological response may \nbe diminished. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nInsufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nIn non-clinical studies, Menveo had no direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Considering the severity of \ninvasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, \npregnancy should not preclude vaccination when the risk of exposure is clearly defined. \n \nAlthough insufficient clinical data on the use of Menveo during breast-feeding are available, it is \nunlikely that secreted antibodies in milk would be harmful when ingested by a breastfed infant. \nTherefore, Menveo may be used during breast feeding. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness has \nbeen very rarely reported following vaccination. This may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness. \nFrequencies are defined as follows: \nVery common: (\u22651/10) \nCommon: (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare: (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000) \n \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials \n \nChildren 2 to 10 years of age \n \nOverall 3464 subjects aged 2 to10 years were exposed to Menveo in completed clinical trials. The \ncharacterization of the safety profile of Menveo in children 2 to 10 years of age is based on data from \nfour clinical trials in which 3181 subjects received Menveo. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions during the clinical trials generally persisted for one to two days \nand were not severe. These adverse reactions were: \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \n \nCommon: eating disorder \n \nNervous system disorders: \n \nVery common: sleepiness, headache \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n \nCommon: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \n \nCommon: rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \n \nCommon: myalgia, arthralgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \n \nVery common: irritability, malaise, injection site pain, injection site erythema (\u226450 mm), injection site \ninduration (\u226450 mm) \nCommon: injection site erythema (>50mm), injection site induration (>50mm), chills, fever \u226538oC \nUncommon: injection site pruritus \n \nIndividuals 11 to 65 years of age \n \nThe characterization of the safety profile of Menveo in adolescents and adults is based on data from \nfive randomised controlled clinical trials including 6401 participants (from 11-65 years of age) who \nreceived Menveo. Among Menveo recipients, 58.9%, 16.4%, 21.3% and 3.4% were in the 11-18 year, \n19-34 year, 35-55 year and 56-65 year age groups, respectively. The two primary safety studies were \nrandomised, active-controlled trials that enrolled participants aged 11 to 55 years (N=2663) \nand 19 to 55 years (N=1606), respectively. \n \nThe incidence and severity of any, local, systemic, and other reactions were generally similar in the \nMenveo groups across all studies and within the adolescent and adult age groups. The reactogenicity \nprofile and rates of adverse events among subjects aged 56-65 years who received Menveo (N=216), \nwere similar to that observed in Menveo recipient subjects aged 11-55. \n \nThe most common local and systemic adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were pain at the \ninjection site and headache. \n \nThe list provided below presents adverse reactions reported in three pivotal and two supportive clinical \ntrials per system organ class. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials usually \nlasted only one to two days and were not usually severe. \n \nNervous system disorders: \n \nVery common: headache \nUncommon: dizziness \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \n \nVery common: nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \n \nCommon: rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \n \nVery common: myalgia \nCommon: arthralgia \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \n \nVery common: injection site pain, injection site erythema (\u226450 mm), injection site induration \n(\u226450 mm), malaise \nCommon: injection site erythema (>50 mm), injection site induration (>50 mm), fever \u226538\u00b0C, chills \nUncommon: injection site pruritus \n \nIn the adolescent age group, the safety and tolerability of the vaccine was favourable relative to Tdap \nand did not substantially change with concomitant or sequential administration of other vaccines. \n \nPost-marketing experience (all age groups) \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nRare: lymphadenopathy \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nNot known: hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nNot known: tonic convulsion, febrile convulsion, syncope \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \n \nNot known: vertigo \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nNot known: injection site cellulitis, injection site swelling, including extensive swelling of the injected \nlimb \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH08. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe efficacy of Menveo has been inferred by measuring the production of serogroup-specific \nanti-capsular antibodies with bactericidal activity. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was measured \nusing human serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA). The hSBA was the original \ncorrelate of protection against meningococcal disease. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n \nImmunogenicity was evaluated in randomised, multicenter, active controlled clinical trials that \nenrolled children (2-10 years of age), adolescents (11-18 years of age), adults (19-55 years of age) \nand older adults (56-65 years of age). \n \nImmunogenicity in children 2 to 10 years of age \n \nIn the pivotal study V59P20 immunogenicity of Menveo was compared to ACWY-D; 1170 children \nwere vaccinated with Menveo and 1161 received the comparator vaccine in the per protocol \npopulations. In two supportive studies V59P8 and V59P10 immunogenicity of Menveo was compared \nto ACWY-PS. \n \nIn the pivotal, randomised, observer-blind study V59P20, in which participants were stratified by age \n(2 through 5 years and 6 through 10 years), the immunogenicity of a single dose of Menveo one month \npost vaccination was compared with the single dose of ACWY-D. Immunogenicity results one month \nafter Menveo vaccination among subjects aged 2-5 years and 6-10 years are summarized below \nin Table 1 \n \nTable 1: Serum bactericidal antibody responses following Menveo one month after \nvaccination among subjects aged 2-5 years and 6-10 years \n \n\nSerogroup \n2-5 years 6-10 years \n\nhSBA \u22651:8 \n(95% CI) \n\nhSBA GMTs \n(95% CI) \n\nhSBA \u22651:8 \n(95% CI) \n\nhSBA GMTs \n(95% CI) \n\nA N=606 N=606 N=551 N=551 \n\n 72% (68, 75) \n26 \n\n(22, 30) \n77% \n\n(74, 81) \n35 \n\n(29, 42) \nC N=607 N=607 N=554 N=554 \n\n 68% (64, 72) \n18 \n\n(15, 20) \n77% \n\n(73, 80) \n36 \n\n(29, 45) \nW-135 N=594 N=594 N=542 N=542 \n\n 90% (87, 92) \n43 \n\n(38, 50) \n91% \n\n(88, 93) \n61 \n\n(52, 72) \nY N=593 N=593 N=545 N=545 \n\n 76% (72, 79) \n24 \n\n(20, 28) \n79% \n\n(76, 83) \n34 \n\n(28, 41) \n \nIn another randomised, observer-blind study (V59P8) US children were immunized with a single dose \nof either Menveo (N=284) or ACWY-PS (N=285). In the children 2-10 years of age, as well as in each \nage strata (2-5 and 6-10 years), immune response as measured by percentage of subjects with \nseroresponse, hSBA\u22651:8 and GMTs were not only non-inferior to comparator vaccine ACWY-PS, \nbut all were statistically higher than the comparator for all serogroups and all immune measurements \nat 1 month post vaccination. At 1 year post vaccination, Menveo continued to be statistically higher \nthan ACWY-PS for serogroups A, W-135 and Y, as measured by percentage of subjects with \nhSBA\u22651:8 and GMTs. Menveo was non-inferior on these endpoints for serogroup C (Table 2). \nThe clinical relevance of higher post-vaccination immune responses is not known. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 2: Immunogenicity of one dose of Menveo or ACWY-PS in subjects 2 through 10 years \nof age, measured at one month and twelve months post-vaccination \n \n\nSero\ngrou\n\np \n\n1 month post-vaccination 12 months post-vaccination \nhSBA \u22651:8 \n(95% CI) \n\nhSBA GMTs \n(95% CI) \n\nhSBA \u22651:8 \n(95% CI) \n\nhSBA GMTs \n(95% CI) \n\nMenveo ACWY-PS Menveo \nACWY-P\n\nS Menveo \nACWY-\n\nPS Menveo ACWY-PS \n\nA N=280 N=281 N=280 N=281 N=253 N=238 N=253 N=238 \n\n 79% (74, 84) \n37% \n\n(31, 43) \n36  \n\n(30, 44) \n\n6.31  \n(5.21, 7.6\n\n4) \n\n23% \n(18, 29) \n\n13% \n(9, 18) \n\n3.88  \n(3.39, 4.4\n\n4) \n\n3 \n(2.61, 3.44) \n\nC N=281 N=283 N=281 N=283 N=252 N=240 N=252 N=240 \n\n 73% (68, 78) \n54% \n\n(48, 60) \n26 \n\n(21, 34) \n15 \n\n(12, 20) \n53% \n\n(47, 59) \n44% \n\n(38, 51) \n11 \n\n(8.64, 13) \n9.02 \n\n(7.23, 11) \nW-\n135 N=279 N=282 N=279 N=282 N=249 N=237 N=249 N=237 \n\n 92% (88, 95) \n66% \n\n(60, 71) \n60 \n\n(50, 71) \n14 \n\n(12, 17) \n90% \n\n(86, 94) \n45% \n\n(38, 51) \n42 \n\n(35, 50) \n7.57 \n\n(6.33, 9.07) \nY N=280 N=282 N=280 N=282 N=250 N=239 N=250 N=239 \n\n 88% (83, 91) \n53% \n\n(47, 59) \n54 \n\n(44, 66) \n11 \n\n(9.29, 14) \n77% \n\n(71, 82) \n32% \n\n(26, 38) \n27 \n\n(22, 33) \n5.29 \n\n(4.34, 6.45) \n \nIn a randomised, observer-blind study (V59P10) conducted in Argentina, children were \nimmunized with a single dose of either Menveo (N=949) or ACWY-PS (N=551). Immunogenicity \nwas assessed in a subset of 150 subjects in each vaccine group. The immune response observed in \nthe children 2-10 years of age was very similar to those observed in the V59P8 study shown above: \nimmune response to Menveo at 1 month post vaccination, as measured by percentage of subjects \nwith seroresponse, hSBA\u22651:8 and GMTs, was non-inferior to ACWY-PS. \n \nA randomised, observer-blind study was conducted in children 12 to 59 months of age in Finland \nand Poland (V59P7). A total of 199 subjects 2-5 years of age were in the Menveo per protocol \nimmunogenicity population and 81 subjects 3-5 years of age were in the ACWY-PS group. \n \nAt 1 month post-first vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA \u2265 1:8 were consistently \nhigher in the Menveo group for all four serogroups (63% vs 39%, 46% vs 39%, 78% vs 59%, and 65% \nvs 57% for Menveo as compared to ACWY-PS for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, respectively). \n \nIn a randomized, observer-blind study (V59_57) conducted in US, immunogenicity of a 2-dose series \nand a single dose of Menveo was compared in children 2 through 5 and 6 through 10 years of age \n(N=715). \nAt baseline, the percentage of subjects with hSBA \u22651:8 across the two age strata was 1%-5% for \nserogroup A, 13%-28% for serogroup C, 42%-64% for serogroup W-135, and 6%-19% for serogroup \nY. At 1 month post last vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA \u22651:8 in the 2-dose group \nand in the single dose group across the two age strata were: 90%-95% vs 76%\u201380% for serogroup A, \n98%-99% vs 76%-87% for serogroup C, 99% vs 93%-96% for serogroup W-135, and 96% vs 65%-\n69% for serogroup Y. GMTs were higher in the 2-dose group than the single dose group at 1 month \nafter vaccination in both age strata; however, this difference was less pronounced in the older age \nstratum. \nAt 1 year post last vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA \u22651:8 after the 2-dose series and \nthe single dose were both lower than at 1 month post-vaccination (30% after the 2-dose series, 11%-\n20% after the single dose for serogroup A; 61%-81% and 41%-55% for serogroup C; 92%-94% and \n90%-91% for serogroup W-135; 67%-75% and 57%-65% for serogroup Y). The differences between \nhSBA GMTs in the 2-dose and the single dose groups at 1 year after vaccination were lower than \nthose seen at 1 month post-vaccination. \nThe clinical benefit of a 2-dose vaccination series in children 2 through 10 years of age is not known. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPersistence of immune response and booster response in children 2 to 10 years of age \n \nAntibody persistence at 5 years after primary vaccination was assessed in study V59P20E1, this was \nan extension of study V59P20.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nMenveo powder and solution for solution for injection \nMeningococcal Group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child are given this medicine because \nit contains important information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Menveo is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Menveo \n3. How to use Menveo \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Menveo \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Menveo is and what it is used for \n \nMenveo is a vaccine that is used for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), \nadolescents and adults at risk of exposure to a bacterium named Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, \nC, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. The vaccine works by causing your body to make its \nown protection (antibodies) against these bacteria. \n \nNeisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious and sometimes \nlife-threatening infections such as meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). \n \nMenveo cannot cause bacterial meningitis. This vaccine contains a protein (called CRM197) from \nthe bacteria that cause diphtheria. Menveo does not protect against diphtheria. This means that \nyou (or your child) should receive other vaccines to protect against diphtheria when these are due \nor when advised by your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Menveo \n \nDo not use Menveo if you or your child has: \n \n- ever had an allergic reaction to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this \nvaccine (listed in section 6) \n- ever had an allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid (a substance used in a number of other \nvaccines) \n- an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example \ncold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Menveo if you or your child: \n- have a weakened immune system. Little is known about the effectiveness of Menveo when \nadministered to individuals with weakened immunity due to the use of immunosuppressive \nmedications, or HIV infection, and other possible causes. It is possible that the effectiveness \nof Menveo could be reduced in such individuals. \n- have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from clotting properly, such as \npersons receiving blood thinners (anticoagulants). \n- receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, \nsuch as eculizumab. Even if you have been vaccinated with Menveo you remain at increased risk of \ndisease caused by the Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria. \n \nFainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. \nTell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. \n \nThis vaccine can only protect against meningococcal group A, C, W-135, and Y bacteria. It cannot \nprotect against other types of meningococcal bacteria other than groups A, C, W-135 and Y, or against \nother causes of meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). \n \nAs with any vaccine, Menveo may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine. \n \nIf you or your child received a dose of Menveo more than one year ago and remains at particular \nrisk of exposure to meningococcal group A bacteria, consideration may be given to administering \na booster dose to maintain protection. Your doctor will advise you if and when you should receive \na booster dose. \n \nOther medicines and Menveo \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nMenveo may be given at the same time as other vaccinations but any other injected vaccines should \npreferably be given into a different arm from the site of the Menveo injection. \n \nThese include the following vaccines: tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap), \nhuman papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever, typhoid fever (Vi polysaccharide), Japanese encephalitis, \nrabies, hepatitis A and B and meningococcal group B (Bexsero). \n \nMenveo\u2019s effect could be diminished when administered to individuals who are taking medicines that \nsuppress the immune system. \n \nSeparate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is being administered at the same time. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before this medicine is given. Your doctor or nurse may still recommend that \nyou receive Menveo if you are at high risk of infection with meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y \nbacteria. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nDizziness has been very rarely reported following vaccination. This may temporarily affect the ability \nto drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nMenveo contains \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nThis medicinal products contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018potassium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Menveo \n \nMenveo will be given to you or your child by a doctor or nurse. \n \nThe vaccine is usually given into the upper arm muscle (deltoid) for children (from 2 years of age), \nadolescents and adults. Your doctor or nurse will take care to ensure the vaccine is not given into \na blood vessel and will make sure that it is injected into muscle and not into the skin. \n \nFor children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults: a single (0.5 ml) injection will be given. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Menveo in children under 2 years of age has not yet been established. There \nare limited data in individuals aged 56-65 and there are no data in subjects aged older than 65 years. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have received a previous injection with Menveo or another \nmeningococcal vaccine. Your doctor will tell you if you need an additional injection of Menveo. \n \nFor information on the reconstitution of the vaccine see the section for medical or healthcare \nprofessionals at the end of this leaflet. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most common side effects reported during clinical trials usually lasted only one to two days \nand were not usually severe. \n \nIn children (from 2 to 10 years of age), the side effects that were reported during clinical trials are \nlisted below. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): sleepiness, headache, irritability, generally \nfeeling unwell, injection site pain, injection site redness (\u2264 50 mm), injection site firmness (\u2264 50 mm) \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): change in eating habits, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, \nmuscle ache, joint ache, chills, fever \u226538oC, injection site redness (>50mm) and injection site \nfirmness (>50mm) \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): injection site itching \n \nIn adolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults, the most common side effects that were reported \nduring clinical trials are listed below. \n \nVery common: headache, nausea, injection site pain, injection site redness (\u2264 50 mm), injection site \nfirmness (\u2264 50 mm), muscle ache, generally feeling unwell \n \nCommon: rash, injection site redness (> 50 mm), injection site firmness (> 50 mm), joint ache, \nfever \u2265 38\u00b0C, chills \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nUncommon: dizziness, injection site itching \n \nSide effects that have been reported during marketed use include: \nRare: enlarged lymph nodes. \nNot known: allergic reactions that may include severe swelling of the lips, mouth, throat (which may \ncause difficulty in swallowing), difficulty breathing with wheezing or coughing, rash and swelling of \nthe hands, feet and ankles, loss of consciousness, very low blood pressure; fits (convulsions) including \nfits associated with fever; balance disorder; faint; infection of the skin at the injection site; injection \nsite swelling, including extensive swelling of the injected limb. \n \nIf a severe allergic reaction occurs tell your doctor straight away or go immediately/ take your child to \nthe nearest Accident and Emergency department because urgent medical help may be needed. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Please note \nthat it is normal for a small amount of liquid to remain in the vial following withdrawal of the dose. \nPrior to injection, change the needle with one suitable for the administration. Ensure that no air \nbubbles are present in the syringe before injecting the vaccine. \n \nFollowing reconstitution, the vaccine is a clear, colourless to light yellow solution, free from visible \nforeign particles. In the event of any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect \nbeing observed, discard the vaccine. \n \nMenveo is given as an intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid muscle. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

allergic reaction to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) - ever had an allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid (a substance used in a number of other vaccines) - an illness with high fever. however, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. warnings and precautions: talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given menveo if you or your child: - have a weakened immune system. little is known about the effectiveness of menveo when administered to individuals with weakened immunity due to the use of immunosuppressive medications, or hiv infection, and other possible causes. it is possible that the effectiveness of menveo could be reduced in such individuals. - have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from clotting properly, such as persons receiving blood thinners (anticoagulants). - receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, such as eculizumab. even if you have been vaccinated with menveo you remain at increased risk of disease caused by the neisseria meningitidis groups a, c, w-135 and y bacteria. fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. this vaccine can only protect against meningococcal group a, c, w-135, and y bacteria. it cannot protect against other types of meningococcal bacteria other than groups a, c, w-135 and y, or against other causes of meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). as with any vaccine, menveo may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine. if you or your child received a dose of menveo more than one year ago and remains at particular risk of exposure to meningococcal group a bacteria, consideration may be given to administering a booster dose to maintain protection. your doctor will advise you if and when you should receive a booster dose. other medicines and menveo tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. menveo may be given at the same time as other vaccinations but any other injected vaccines should preferably be given into a different arm from the site of the menveo injection. these include the following vaccines: tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis (tdap), human papillomavirus (hpv), yellow fever, typhoid fever (vi polysaccharide), japanese encephalitis, rabies, hepatitis a and b and meningococcal group b (bexsero). menveo's effect could be diminished when administered to individuals who are taking medicines that suppress the immune system. separate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is being administered at the same time. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before this medicine is given. your doctor or nurse may still recommend that you receive menveo if you are at high risk of infection with meningococcal group a, c, w-135 and y bacteria. driving and using machines no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. dizziness has been very rarely reported following vaccination. this may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. menveo contains this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'. this medicinal products contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "menveo", "Type":
